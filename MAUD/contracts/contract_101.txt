RECITALS 


WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) has unanimously approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), and has approved and declared this Agreement fair and advisable to and in the best interests of its stockholders;

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to prescribe certain conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

________________


Section 2.4. Directors. The Parties shall take all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws. 


Section 2.5. Officers. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws. 


Section 2.6. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital stock of the Company or any other Person: (a) Common Stock Merger Consideration. Each share of Common Stock (“Common Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares, Converted Shares and Dissenting Shares (collectively, “Excluded Shares”)) shall at the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $11.50 per Share in cash (the “Common Stock Merger Consideration”), without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes pursuant to Section 2.7(g), whereupon such Common Shares will cease to exist and no longer be outstanding, and each holder thereof will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.7. (b) Preferred Stock Merger Consideration. Each share of Company Preferred Stock (“Preferred Shares”, collectively with the Common Shares, the “Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall at the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the sum of (1) the product of (x) the Common Stock Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) 1.66611, plus (2) an amount equal to (x) the number of Preferred Shares issuable in respect of any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon as of the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Common Stock Merger Consideration multiplied by (z) 1.66611, in cash (the “Preferred Stock Merger Consideration”, collectively with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”), without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes pursuant to Section 2.7(g), whereupon such Preferred Shares will cease to exist and no longer be outstanding, and each holder thereof will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.7. (c) Cancellation of Cancelled Shares; Conversion of Converted Shares. Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time are held by the Company in treasury or by Parent or Merger Sub or by any Person of which Parent is a Subsidiary (collectively, “Cancelled Shares”) shall at the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time are held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) (collectively, “Converted Shares”) shall at the   3








________________


Effective Time automatically be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. (d) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 


Section 2.7. Payment. (a) Paying Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a national bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II, and in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to the Paying Agent’s responsibilities with respect to this Agreement. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or shall cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of Shares a cash amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as set forth herein. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent, provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under this Article II shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration under this Article II. No investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. (b) Procedures for Surrender. (i) Stock Certificates. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Effective Time occurs), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (each such certificate, a “Certificate”), which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in customary form and with such other   4








________________


provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree, and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration for which such Shares have been converted pursuant the provisions of this Article II. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II in respect of each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable in respect of any Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate and such Person shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes shall have been paid or are not required to be paid. (ii) Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) and whose Shares were converted pursuant to the provisions of this Article II into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver (after giving effect to any required withholding Taxes as provided in Section 2.7(g)) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II in respect of each Share formerly represented by such Book- Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. (c) Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the close of business on the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.7(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive the Merger   5

Consideration, without interest thereon, as contemplated by Section 2.6(a). If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or, in the case of Book- Entry Shares, such Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer or for any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Record Holders of Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for recourse, which shall remain responsible for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares as provided in this Article II, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, and if required by Parent in its reasonable discretion, the posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, without any interest thereon. (f) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Converted Shares) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and had become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) reasonably prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. Parent shall have the right to direct and control all   6








________________


negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or compromise, or settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to comply with Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

performance of the Equity Investors’ obligation to fund the Cash Equity, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and herein. The cash equity committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Cash Equity.” The Cash Equity and the Debt Financing are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Financing.” (c) Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters and any fee letters related thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee, “flex” terms and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with transactions of this type and that could not in any event adversely affect the availability, conditionality, enforceability or amount of the Financing. (d) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Financing Parties and the Equity Investors to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Financing Parties or the Equity Investors to reduce the total amount of the Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating to the amount or availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to any “flex” provision. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all of the terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent or Merger Sub have knowledge that any of the Financing Parties or the Equity Investors will not perform its obligations thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment Letters that could adversely affect the availability, conditionality, enforceability or amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters. (e) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 3.3 and Section 3.20, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters, will, in the aggregate, provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement and under the Commitment Letters, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any payments pursuant to Section 2.8, payment of any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or the Commitment Letters (such amounts, collectively, the “Merger Amounts”). (f) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters constitute the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, of all the other parties thereto, except as limited by the Enforceability Exceptions, and are in full force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent or Merger Sub under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters, and (ii) assuming satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by Law) of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent has paid or caused to be paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters   30

To the Knowledge of Parent, no modification of, or amendment to, the Commitment Letters is currently contemplated except for the addition as parties to the Debt Commitment Letter of the Financing Parties, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar entities who have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. (g) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement.

As of the date hereof, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of the Guarantors under the Limited Guarantee.

Section 4.11. Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) Without limiting the obligations under Section 5.2(e), within one (1) Business Day following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Excluded Party.   38

(iii) On the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers and employees and shall instruct its Affiliates and other Representatives to immediately cease all solicitations, discussions and negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and its Representatives and any Excluded Party and its Representatives so long as such Excluded Party remains an Excluded Party in accordance with the terms hereof) that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and request (promptly but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following the No-Shop Period Start Date) that each such Person (other than Parent and its Representatives and any Excluded Party and its Representatives so long as such Excluded Party remains an Excluded Party in accordance with the terms hereof) promptly return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities described in clause (B) of Section 5.2(a)(i) with respect to any Excluded Party (so long as such Excluded Party remains an Excluded Party in accordance with the terms hereof). (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives, receives a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2, the Company and its Representatives may contact the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and may (i) provide information to such Person if the Company receives from such Person an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that the Company shall make available to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or group of Persons which was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub substantially concurrently (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person or group of Persons, if prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, (A) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. (c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2(c) or in Section 5.2(d), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (2) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (3) adopt, approve or recommend or endorse or otherwise declare advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (4) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation in connection with the public disclosure by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal (other than of the type referred to in the following clause (5)) by any Person other than Parent and Merger Sub; provided that the Company shall not be required to make such   39

reaffirmation more than once in respect of such public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal except in connection with any material amendment of such Acquisition Proposal (and no more than once in connection with each such amendment); or (5) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange Act, against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (any of the foregoing, a “Change of Recommendation”). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may (x) effect a Change of Recommendation contemplated by clauses (1) or (2) of the definition thereof if, upon the occurrence of an Intervening Event, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law or (y) if the Company receives, directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives, a written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2, effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a) in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, and, in the case of either clause (x) or (y): (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four (4) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a) (a “Notice of Change of Recommendation/Termination”), which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Change of Recommendation and/or termination and (A) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof along with a copy of any proposed agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal (or, if there is no such proposed agreement, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal); or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, reasonable detail regarding the Intervening Event; (ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation and/or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a), the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to be available to negotiate, with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day period to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would obviate the need for the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a); and (iii) following the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and, with respect to clause (A) below, its financial advisor, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Change of Recommendation/Termination, that (A) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Change of Recommendation/Termination continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.   40

Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material change to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require the Company to deliver a new Notice of Change of Recommendation/Termination and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of clauses (i)-(iii) above; provided, however, that references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall then be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of Change of Recommendation/Termination (it being understood that no such new Notice of Change of Recommendation/Termination shall reduce the initial four (4) Business Day period). (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law or NASDAQ rules or regulation, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or (ii) making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to stockholders of the Company, including any such similar communication in response to an Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender offer or exchange offer); provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend any Acquisition Proposal (including that the stockholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is an Acquisition Proposal) or otherwise effect a Change of Recommendation with respect thereto, except as permitted by Section 5.2(c). (e) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if, from and after the date hereof, any Acquisition Proposal is received by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives, indicating the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including, if applicable, providing copies of any proposed agreements related thereto). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall (x) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing (i) if the Company determines to begin providing non-public information to any Person in accordance with this Section 5.2 and the identity of such Person or Persons receiving such non-public information, (ii) from and after the No Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, from and after the date such Person is no longer an Excluded Party), if the Company determines to engage in negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with this Section 5.2 and (iii) of any change to the financial and other material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal, and (y) otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, discussions or negotiations on a reasonably current basis (but in no event shall such notification be required to be provided more often than once every 48 hours), including by providing a copy of all proposals, offers or drafts of proposed agreements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.   41

Section 5.3. Proxy Statement. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to the Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”), and each of the Company and Parent shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, prepare and file with the SEC all other documents required by the Exchange Act in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any such other filings. Except as permitted by Section 5.2, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation; provided, that if the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.2, then in submitting this Agreement to the Company’s stockholders, the Company Board may submit this Agreement to the Company’s stockholders without the Company Recommendation, in which event the Company Board may communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation to the Company’s stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment thereof or supplement thereto. Parent agrees to provide or cause to be provided all information with respect to itself, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives as may be reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and any such other filings. (b) Each Party shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other Parties of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide to the other Party copies of all written correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC and to make any amendments or filings as may be necessary in connection therewith and (ii) have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC staff as soon as reasonably practical after such filing. The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date that the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. (c) Subject to applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on (which comments shall be made promptly) such document or response and shall consider in good faith including in such document or response such comments reasonably proposed by Parent.   42

(d) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this Section 5.3(d) shall limit the rights or obligations of any Party under any other paragraph of this Section 5.3. (e) All documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

Unless there has been a Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.2, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to lawfully obtain the Stockholder Approval, including actively soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any other Acquisition Proposal. (b) The Company shall keep Parent informed with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent and shall provide such information and reasonable cooperation as Parent may reasonably request in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall remain obligated to provide the information and cooperation described in the immediately preceding sentence and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto that maybe required by applicable Law) to the Company’s stockholders in accordance with Section 5.3 and this Section 5.4, notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation.   43

Section 5.8. Employee Benefits. (a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof (the “Benefit Continuation Period”), Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues in employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing Employees”) with (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage (whichever is applicable) and a short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity, that, in each case, is not less than the base salary or regular hourly wage and short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity in effect for, or available to, the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits and on terms and conditions, in each case, that are no less favorable than the severance benefits and protections provided to each such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth in Section 5.8(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii) other compensation opportunities (excluding any equity award or other long-term compensation opportunities) and employee benefits (excluding any severance (which shall be covered by the preceding subsection (ii)), change-in-control or retention benefits) that are, in each case, substantially similar in the aggregate to the other compensation (excluding any equity award or other long-term compensation opportunities) and employee benefits (excluding any severance (which shall be covered by the preceding subsection (ii)), change-in-control or retention benefits), respectively, provided or available to the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, during the Benefit Continuation Period, Parent shall not be required to provide Continuing Employees with deferred compensation, defined benefit pension plans, or long-term incentive, equity or equity-based compensation. (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and assume, or shall cause to be honored and assumed, the terms of all Company Benefit Plans that remain in effect as of the Effective Time in accordance with their terms.

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Continuing Employees following the Closing Date Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements with respect to any such plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee to the same extent waived under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to any eligible expenses paid by such employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs (or such later date on which a Continuing Employee commences participation in any new plan of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) under analogous Company Benefit Plans. (e) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, cash incentive bonus programs with an in-cycle performance period occurring during the year in which the Closing occurs shall be paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, based on actual achievement of the applicable performance goals (which performance goals shall not be modified following the Closing in a way that would be detrimental to the participants, and such calculation shall exclude (x) merger-related transaction costs and (y) costs and expenses incurred at the request of Parent or in connection with any post-closing restructuring or transaction that Parent desires to take following the Effective Time). (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms after the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 5.8 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 5.10. Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (collectively, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, related to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether prior to or at the Effective Time (including in connection with such Indemnified Parties’ service as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan or services performed by such persons at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification, exculpation or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, shall, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, cause the Charter and the Bylaws to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities and rights to advancement of expenses than those set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall advance costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) as incurred by any Indemnified Party promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days) after receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and such determination shall have become final, that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event any proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party under this Section 5.10, (x) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Parent   51

and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this clause (x) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; provided, that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (y) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; and (z) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent; and provided, further, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pre-pay the premium for (and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain with reputable and financially sound carriers) the extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies (the “D&O Insurance”), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period (whichever is greater) of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim arising from facts or events that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under the Company’s existing policies in effect on the date hereof. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable insurance as the D&O Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required to, and without the consent of Parent be permitted to, expend for any such policies pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the aggregate of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance, which annual premium is set forth in Section 5.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (y) if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such maximum amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for such maximum amount. (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that such surviving or acquiring Person(s), as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.   52

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. (e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.10 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under any applicable Contracts or Laws or otherwise. All rights to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time) as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Contract or otherwise between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect (and shall be so maintained) and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Indemnified Party, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.10 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. 


Section 5.11. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause any dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 


Section 5.12. Financing. (a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and employees to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters as promptly as possible (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period), but in any event on or prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, including by using reasonable best efforts with respect to (i) causing the Equity Investors to maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and complying with their respective obligations thereunder, (iii) negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the “Definitive Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any related fee letter) or, if available, on other terms that (A) are acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion, (B) would not reasonably be expected to delay (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or adversely affect the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (C) would otherwise be permitted by Section 5.12(b), and (iv) satisfying (or, if reasonably required to obtain the Financing, seeking the waiver of) on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Definitive Agreements that are within the control of Parent or Merger Sub. In the   53

event that all conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements (other than the consummation of the Merger and other than the availability of the Cash Equity and those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Parties thereunder to comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including to fund the Debt Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with its respective obligations, and enforce its respective rights, under the Commitment Letters and Definitive Agreements in a timely and diligent manner. (b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, without the prior written consent of the Company: (i) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters (or the Definitive Agreements, to the extent entered into prior to the Closing Date) if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing, (B) reduces the amount of the Financing to an amount that, together with available cash or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, would on the Closing Date be less than the Merger Amounts, (C) adversely affects in a material respect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or (D) could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) terminate any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement unless such Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreement is replaced at such time with a new commitment letter or a new definitive agreement that would satisfy the preceding clause (i). Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the Commitment Letters in accordance with this Section 5.12(b), all references herein to “Commitment Letter”, “Equity Commitment Letter” or “Debt Commitment Letter”, as applicable, shall include and mean such documents as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with this Section 5.12(b), and references to “Financing”, or “Debt Financing”, as applicable, shall include and mean the financing contemplated by such Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with this Section 5.12(b). (c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, or the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements shall be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent and Merger Sub will (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with Cash Equity, and the available portion of the Debt Financing and other available funds or cash to Parent and its Subsidiaries in any respect, to pay the Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts) from the same or other sources on terms and conditions that are not less favorable to Parent and its Subsidiaries than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of such alternative debt financing less likely to occur, than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date   54

hereof and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability, withdrawal, repudiation, termination or rescission, as applicable, and the reason therefor. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Debt Commitment Letter” shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative or replacement financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with prompt oral and written notice of any actual or threatened breach, termination, repudiation or default by any party to any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement, in each case, of which Parent or Merger Sub obtain Knowledge and the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Financing Party, Equity Investor or other financing source with respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 5.12 shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Debt Commitment Letter” shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative or replacement financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question).

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach or threaten to breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, except as expressly provided in Section 8.7(b).

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (i) there is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an order or injunction to prevent breaches or threatened breaches and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.   68

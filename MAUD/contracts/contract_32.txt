AGREEMENT 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 


SECTION 1. THE OFFER 1.1 The Offer. (a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8, promptly after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to Sections 1.1(e) and 1.2(b)), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Sections 2.5(a)(i) and 2.5(a)(ii) (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”), at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest, and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section 2.6(e). (b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer.

The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the “Offer to Purchase”) that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   2

Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in clauses (d) or (f) of Annex I, (F) otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any holder of Shares in its capacity as such, or that would or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair, prevent or materially delay Parent’s or Purchaser’s ability to consummate the Transactions in a timely manner, (G) terminate the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date, in each case, except as provided in Sections 1.1(c) or 1.1(d) or (H) provide any “subsequent offering period” (or any extension thereof) within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8. (c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the date that is twenty (20) business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) from the Offer Commencement Date (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the “Initial Expiration Date”, and such date or such subsequent date to which the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the “Expiration Date”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties’ respective termination rights under Section 8: (i) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by Purchaser or Parent, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8 and (y) the End Date (such earlier occurrence, the “Extension Deadline”); or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer, or permit the Offer to expire, prior to the Expiration Date or the earlier valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8 without the prior written consent of the Company.     3

In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(e) Offer Documents. Promptly on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, including the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal, the “Offer Documents”) that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC (x) to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Subject to Section 6.1(b), the Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parent’s legal counsel all information concerning the Company and the Company’s stockholders that may be required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or as reasonably requested in order to comply with the actions contemplated by this Section 1.1(e).

Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments). Each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. (f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.11, Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis (and in any event prior to the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date), all of the funds necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchaser’s obligations under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer.     4

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted. (h) Acceptance. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) (i) promptly after (and in any event prior to 9.30 a.m. Eastern Time on the Business Day following) the Expiration Date, irrevocably accept for payment all Shares tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the “Offer Acceptance Time”) and (ii) promptly after (and in any event no later than the second (2nd) business day after) the Offer Acceptance Time, pay for such Shares. (i) Notification of Offer Status. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the Offer, including with respect to the number of Shares that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer, and with respect to any material developments with respect thereto and, upon the Company’s written request, use its reasonable best efforts to provide the Company as soon as practicable with the most recent report then available from the Depository Agent detailing the number of Shares that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer. (j) Transfer Taxes. If the payment of the Offer Price is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the tendered Shares are registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Offer Price to a Person other than the registered holder of the Shares tendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Purchaser that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this Section 1.1(i) under any circumstance. 1.2 Company Actions. (a) Schedule 14D-9. Promptly on the Offer Commencement Date, following the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the “Schedule 14D-9”) that, subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and include the notice and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record date for purposes of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.

other applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company or the Company’s legal counsel all information concerning Parent or Purchaser that may be required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or as reasonably requested in order to comply with the actions contemplated by this Section 1.2(a). Except with respect to any filing in connection with or following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or in connection with any disclosures made in compliance with Section 5.3 or Section 6.1, Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by Parent or its counsel. Except with respect to any filing in connection with or following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or in connection with any disclosures made in compliance with Section 5.3 or Section 6.1, the Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments). The Company shall respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 or the Offer. (b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case, to the extent in the Company’s possession or control, as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer and the Merger (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, which date shall not be more than ten (10) business days prior to the date the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the “Stockholder List Date”). Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request by the Company, deliver, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or control, and, if requested by the Company, promptly certify to the Company in writing that all such material has been returned or destroyed.   6

No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this Section 2.6(b) under any circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.

Each such withholding agent shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding obligation may be avoided by a payee providing information or documentation to the applicable payor, such payor shall request such information from such payee and use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding obligation, which the Parties agree shall be satisfied by the provision of the letter of transmittal described in Section 1.1(e) Section 2.6(b), as applicable. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants or other recipient of consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder, claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2.   11

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of each of the fully executed Royalty Purchase Agreement and Revenue Participation Rights Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and among the Financing Sources party thereto and the Parent (together with all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, the “Royalty Purchase Agreements”), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Royalty Purchase Agreements, the Financing Sources party thereto have agreed to purchase certain royalty streams of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries in consideration of the purchase prices set forth in the Royalty Purchase Agreements and aggregating not less than $1,425,000,000 in cash (the “Financing”). (b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Royalty Purchase Agreements are in full force and effect and constitute the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against the Parent in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, and by general equitable principles. There are no conditions precedent related to the provision of the full amount of the Financing other than the conditions precedent expressly set forth in the respective Royalty Purchase Agreement. (c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Royalty Purchase Agreements have not been amended or modified in any manner, and the respective commitments contained in the Royalty Purchase Agreements have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto. Parent is not in default or material breach under the terms and conditions of any Royalty Purchase Agreement and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or material breach by Parent or a failure to satisfy a condition of Parent under the terms and conditions of any Royalty Purchase Agreement.

(e) There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to any Royalty Purchase Agreement or the Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability,   32

conditionality, enforceability, termination or amount of Financing contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements in any material respect. Parent or an Affiliate of Parent on its behalf has fully paid any and all fees and other amounts required by the Royalty Purchase Agreements to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. (f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing and the closing of the Royalty Purchase Agreements) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent hereunder. (g) No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries). Immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, assuming that the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Closing and the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the transactions set forth herein, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 4.11(g), “Solvent” means, with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that: (i) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, shall be greater than the total amount of the liabilities (including all liabilities, whether or not reflected in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with IFRS, and whether direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed) of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis; (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, shall be able to pay their debts and obligations in the ordinary course of business as they become due; and (iii) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, shall have adequate capital to carry on their businesses.

Corporations as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of preparing for the Closing; provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted at Parent’s expense at a reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Acquired Corporations and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Acquired Corporations. Solely for purposes of integration planning and Parent’s monitoring of the Acquired Corporation’s cash position and compliance with Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 of this Agreement, the Acquired Corporations shall reasonably consult with Parent in respect of such matters, and use reasonable best efforts to (i) provide Parent with written cash management reports each week describing the Acquired Corporations’ cash position and use of cash for the prior week and a cash forecast for the succeeding week, and such other related information as is otherwise reasonably requested by Parent and (ii) participate in discussions weekly, or as otherwise reasonably requested by Parent to review any such cash management reports and cash forecasts; provided, that such cash management reports, cash forecasts or other related information and such discussions shall be provided for disclosure purposes only and not be deemed to broaden or narrow any the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement. Nothing herein shall require any of the Acquired Corporations to disclose any information to Parent or afford any access to Parent if: (i) such disclosure or access would, in the Company’s good-faith discretion with the advice of legal counsel (x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (y) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which an Acquired Corporation or its Affiliate is a party); or (ii) such information relates to the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board or its committees where the Company Board or any applicable committee discussed the Transactions or any similar transaction between the Company and any other Person (including any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the Company Board, whether in connection with a specific meeting, or otherwise relating to such subject matter). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make any disclosure to the other pursuant to this Section 5.1 to the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties or reasonably likely to become adverse parties. To the extent that the Company determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws, information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent. With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.1, Parent shall comply with, and shall instruct Parent’s Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement dated November 20, 2020, as amended April 14, 2021, between the Company and Parent (the “Confidentiality Agreement”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Acquired Corporations may satisfy their obligations set forth above to provide access to personnel, assets, books, records, work papers and any other documents and information by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under the applicable Legal Requirements (including any COVID-19 Measures).   34

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time: (i) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and/or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer, in each case, if: (A) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), including, if not already provided, providing to Parent the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, at least three (3) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination (a “Determination Notice”) (which notice shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination); and (B) at the end of the three (3) business-day period following the provision of the Determination Notice, after giving effect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent or any other proposals irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to such Determination Notice, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer. Issuance of any “stop, look and listen” communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to three (3) business days shall be deemed to be two (2) business days; and (ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Change in Circumstance, if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice, specifying the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail, at least three (3) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and (C) at the end of the three (3) business-day period following the provision of the Determination Notice, after giving effect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent or any other proposals irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to such Determination Notice, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Change in Circumstance would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Legal Requirements.   40

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals. (a) Each of the Parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Legal Requirements, including applicable Antitrust Laws, to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods from Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body in connection with any Antitrust Law; and (ii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions. (b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.2, the Parties agree to promptly take, and cause their Affiliates to take, all actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to resolve objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, or other Governmental Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are sought with respect to the Transactions, so as to obtain such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Bodies under any Antitrust Law, and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or materially delaying the Offer Acceptance Time or the Closing or delaying the Offer Acceptance Time beyond the End Date, including (i) negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, lease, license, divestiture or disposition of any entities, businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines, assets, or Intellectual Property of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions with respect to the entities, businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines, assets, or Intellectual Property of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided, however, that the Parties shall not be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction that would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Parent and the Acquired Corporations on a combined basis and provided further that the Company and the Acquired Corporations shall not be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, unless such action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company and the Acquired Corporations only in the event the Closing occurs. The Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the End Date; provided that such litigation in no way limits the obligation of Purchaser and Parent to take all actions and steps to eliminate each and every impediment identified herein.     41

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date hereof, make an appropriate filing of all notification and report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and promptly make all other filings, notifications or other consents as may be required to be made or obtained by such Party under any other Antitrust Laws; and (ii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other filings, notifications or other consents that are required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions or from any Persons with respect to the contracts set forth on Schedule 3.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. (d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.2, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including allowing the other Parties to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions; (iii) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; (iv) promptly inform the other Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; (v) promptly furnish to the other Parties, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, with copies of documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding; (vi) consult in advance and cooperate with the other Party and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any communication, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, except that each Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate material provided to the other Party as “Outside Counsel Only Material,” and also may redact the material as necessary to (A) remove competitively sensitive information, (B) remove references concerning valuation, (C) comply with contractual arrangements, (D) address legal privilege, or (E) comply with applicable Legal Requirements; and (vii) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto shall provide advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the other Parties to be present at each meeting, teleconference or videoconference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each Party shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable such information, documentation, other material or testimony that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Body, including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any reasonable request for additional information, documents or other materials received by any Party or any of its Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body in connection with such applications or filings for the Transactions. Purchaser shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act and for any filings required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws. Neither Party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Body to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or withdraw any notification filed under the HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other.   42

(e) Prior to Closing, without the prior written approval of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not effect or agree to any business combination (whether structured as a merger, business combination, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction) or the acquisition of any assets, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of any person that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. 6.3 Employee Benefits. (a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of an Acquired Corporation who is employed by an Acquired Corporation as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one (1)-year period (each, a “Continuing Employee”) (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that provided to such Continuing Employee by the applicable Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash incentive compensation opportunity with respect to fiscal year 2022 that is no less favorable than that provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) other employee benefits that in the aggregate are no less favorable than either (A) those provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) those provided to similarly situated Parent Employees employed in the United States. In addition, with respect to fiscal year 2022 (commencing with the annual grants to be made in April 2022), Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with an annual equity incentive compensation opportunity that is comparable to that provided to similarly situated United States employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. (b) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual under any compensation or benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates in which a Continuing Employee participates following the Effective Time (but not for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan), Parent shall ensure that such compensation or benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual, credit each Continuing Employee for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its Affiliates or their respective predecessors to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding Employee Plan; provided that such service is not required to be recognized solely to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Following the Effective Time, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent shall, with respect to each Continuing Employee, (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent that provides health benefits in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents immediately prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding Employee Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by such Continuing Employee and   43








________________


his or her eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to transitioning into a plan of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent during the portion of the calendar year prior to such transition in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time. (c) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each employee who, (1) immediately prior to the Effective Time, is employed by an Acquired Corporation and is eligible to participate in a 2021 annual bonus program of an Acquired Corporation, and (2) remains employed with the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate on the date such annual bonus would be payable pursuant to the Company’s ordinary course payment schedule (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be later than March 15, 2022), an annual bonus payment with respect to 2021, which bonus payment shall be equal to such employee’s target annual bonus for 2021. (d) The provisions of this Section 6.3 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no provision of this Section 6.3 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation or to any compensation or benefits and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be “at will” employment. 6.4 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of any Acquired Corporation and any indemnification or other similar agreements of any Acquired Corporation, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to perform their obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of any Acquired Corporation or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of any Acquired Corporation as a director or officer of another Person (the “Indemnified Persons”), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective   44








________________


Time, including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of any Acquired Corporation or is or was serving at the request of any Acquired Corporation as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with the organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Corporation’s or its Subsidiaries’ certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any such indemnification or other similar agreements, as applicable, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. (b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (regardless of when such claims are brought) (with insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Acquired Corporations (the “Maximum Amount”). If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.4(b) because its cost exceeds the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six (6)-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option, purchase a “tail” directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’, employment practices and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.     45

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent’s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4. (d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 (i) shall survive the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Persons), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.4 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person. 6.5 Stockholder Litigation. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the valid termination of this Agreement, the Company shall control the defense of any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions (whether directly or on behalf of the Acquired Corporations or otherwise); provided, however, that the Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such litigation, and the Company shall consult with Parent prior to the settlement, release, waiver or compromise of any such litigation, and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into account, and no such settlement, release, waiver or compromise of such litigation shall be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that no prior written consent is required to the extent the settlement is fully covered by the Company’s insurance policies (other than any applicable deductible), but only if such settlement would not result in the imposition of any restriction on the business or operations of the Company. 6.6 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the provisions of Section 5.3, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (a) make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such Party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions and (b) use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger brought by any third Person against such Party.   46

6.7 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press release(s), public disclosure, statement or announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release, public statement or announcement without the other Party’s written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in publicly available conference calls and in the Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures, statements or announcements made jointly by the parties (or individually if approved by the other Party); (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party (except Parent shall not be obligated to give advance notice in the event of an ad hoc release pursuant Article 17 of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation)), issue any such press release or make any such public disclosure, statement or announcement as may be required by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult with Parent or obtain its consent in connection with any press release, public disclosure, statement or announcement contemplated, permitted or required pursuant to Section 5.3, Section 6.1 or with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Change in Circumstance. 6.8 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company and the Parent Management Board, the Parent Supervisory Board, and each of Purchaser’s and the Company’s respective boards of directors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Transactions. 6.9 Section 16 Matters. The Company, and the Company Board (or a duly formed committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)), shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation of Shares, and Company Options in the Transactions by applicable individuals and to cause such dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 6.10 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the compensation committee of the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, will approve, as an “employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement” within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each agreement, arrangement or understanding between an Acquired Corporation or any of its Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of the Acquired Corporations that are effective as of the date of this Agreement or are entered into after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to which compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and will take all other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.   47

6.11 Obligations of Parent. Parent shall cause Purchaser and each of Parent’s other Subsidiaries, and the Surviving Corporation, to comply with, duly perform, satisfy and discharge on a timely basis, all of their respective covenants, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, and Parent shall be jointly and severally liable with its Subsidiaries for the due and timely performance, satisfaction and discharge of each of said covenants, obligations and liabilities. Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of MorphoSys US Inc. shall cause MorphoSys US Inc., in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Purchaser, to approve and adopt this Agreement by written consent immediately following its execution. 6.12 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration.

As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide the holder of each Company Warrant with written notice of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of the Company Warrants. 6.14 Parent Financing.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, unless, and to the extent Parent shall have demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company that Parent shall have readily available to it sufficient cash from other financing sources (including by reason of capital markets, securities, other financing transactions or Alternative Financing), Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the proceeds of the Financing and to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements (including, in the event all conditions contained in any Royalty Purchase Agreement have been satisfied, using reasonable best efforts to (x) cause the Financing Sources to comply with their respective obligations, and (y) comply with its obligations and enforce its rights under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, in each case, in a timely and diligent manner) on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the Royalty Purchase Agreements, including using reasonable best efforts to:     48

(i) maintain in effect the Royalty Purchase Agreements and comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis, and in a manner that will not impede the ability of the Parties to consummate the Transactions promptly upon the Closing Date, all conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth in the Royalty Purchase Agreements. Parent shall (A) upon reasonable request, keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status of Parent’s efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements and any other financing, (B) give the Company prompt notice of (x) any fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on the Financing contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements or (y) any default, termination, cancellation, breach or threatened in writing breach by any party to the Royalty Purchase Agreements of which Parent has become aware and (C) provide to the Company correct and executed copies of any material agreements entered into prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Financing. (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Royalty Purchase Agreements without the Company’s prior written consent; provided that Parent may, without the Company’s prior written consent, enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Royalty Purchase Agreements that would not, and would not reasonably be expected to, (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing contemplated by the applicable Royalty Purchase Agreement, (B) adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against any other party to the Royalty Purchase Agreements, in each case, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Royalty Purchase Agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or (C) otherwise prevent, delay in any material respect or impede the consummation of the Transactions or the Financing, including without limitation by imposing new or additional conditions precedent or expanding any existing condition precedent to the receipt and availability of the Financing. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver, the term “Royalty Purchase Agreement” shall include the applicable Royalty Purchase Agreement, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of any Royalty Purchase Agreement and/or any such waiver of a provision of any Royalty Purchase Agreement. (c) If all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Royalty Purchase Agreements, or any Royalty Purchase Agreement is withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded, regardless of the reason therefor, then Parent shall: (i) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable, from the same and/or alternative financing sources, alternative financing in an amount sufficient, when taken together with cash on hand readily available to Parent (as demonstrated by Parent to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay any amounts due from Parent under this Agreement and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative financing that are more onerous, when taken as a whole, than the conditions set forth in the Royalty Purchase Agreements, and   49








________________


(ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason for such unavailability. 


In the event any alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 6.14(c) (“Alternative Financing”), references in this Agreement to the “Financing” shall also be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more purchase or sale agreements, commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this Agreement to the “Royalty Purchase Agreements” shall also be deemed to refer to such purchase or sale agreements, commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parent’s obligations with respect to the Financing. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing contemplated by the Royalty Purchase Agreements) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of Parent’s obligations hereunder. 


SECTION 7. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE MERGER The obligations of the Parties to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver as of the Closing of each of the following conditions: 7.1 No Restraints. There shall not have been issued by any Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material business operations, and remain in effect any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger, nor shall there be any Legal Requirement promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material business operations which prohibits, or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that no Party shall be permitted to invoke this Section 7.1 unless it shall have taken all actions required under this Agreement to have any such order lifted. 7.2 Consummation of Offer.

________________


7.3 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Parent or Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7 or Annex I to be satisfied if such failure was proximately caused by the failure of such Party to perform any of its covenants, obligations or agreements under this Agreement. 


SECTION 8. TERMINATION 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective Time (or prior to such earlier time as set forth in this Section 8.1): (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time; (b) by either Parent or the Company, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on December 1, 2021 (the “End Date”); provided, however, that (x) if as of the End Date the conditions set forth in clause (d) or (f) of Annex I (in the case of (f), solely with respect to an order, injunction or Legal Requirement relating to Antitrust Laws), shall not have been satisfied or validly waived by Parent or Purchaser, to the extent waivable in accordance with this Agreement and applicable Legal Requirements by Parent or Purchaser, then the End Date shall automatically be extended one (1) time (but no more than one (1) time) by a period of ninety (90) calendar days (and all references to the End Date herein and in Annex I shall be as so extended); and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose material breach of this Agreement has caused or resulted in the Offer not being consummated by such date; (c) by either Parent or the Company if a Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material business operations shall have issued a decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall be final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any Party whose material breach of this Agreement has caused or resulted in such final and non-appealable order, decree, ruling or other action or that has failed to comply with its obligations under Section 6.2 with respect to the removal of such order, injunction decree, ruling or other action; (d) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if: (i) the Company Board shall have failed to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when mailed, or shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or (ii) in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act, other than the Offer, the Company Board fails to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business days of the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer; (e) by the Company, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of a transaction (or series of related transactions) which the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, constitutes a Superior Offer (a “Specified Agreement”) in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(i);     51

(f) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred such that the conditions set forth in clause (b) or (c) of Annex I would not be satisfied and cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date, or if capable of being cured in such time frame, shall not have commenced to have been cured within thirty (30) days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach or failure to perform; provided, however, that, Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) if either Parent or Purchaser is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, which breach has not been cured; (g) by the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser shall have occurred, in each case, if such breach or failure would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and such breach or failure cannot be cured by Parent or Purchaser by the End Date, or if capable of being cured in such time frame, shall not have commenced to have been cured within thirty (30) days of the date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure to perform; provided, however, that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if the Company is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, which breach has not been cured; or (h) by the Company (i) if following the expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall have failed to accept for payment all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer within the period specified in Section 1.1(h) or (ii) if, following the Offer Acceptance Time, Purchaser shall have failed to purchase all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer within the period specified in Section 1.1(h). 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and there shall be no liability in connection with this Agreement on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective financing sources, former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates following any such termination; provided, however, that (a) Section 1.1(d), the final sentence of Section 1.2(b), the fifth sentence of Section 5.1, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and (c) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability for fraud or willful or material breach of the covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement prior to the date of termination. Nothing shall limit or prevent any Party from exercising any rights or remedies it may have under Section 9.5(c) in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1. Solely with respect to the rights of the Financing Sources, this Section 8.2 may not be amended, altered, waived or repealed without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.   52

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fee. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.2 and this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated, except Parent and the Company shall each bear and pay one-half of the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9. (b) In the event that: (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e); (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d); or (iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the proviso to Section 8.1(b)) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) resulting from a willful and material breach of Section 5.3, (y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior to such termination and such Acquisition Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn prior to such termination and (z) within six (6) months of such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated, whether during or following such six (6)-month period) or consummated an Acquisition Proposal; provided that for purposes of this clause (z) the references to “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” shall be deemed to be references to “50%”; 


then, in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(i), on the date that the Specified Agreement is executed (or if the Specified Agreement is executed on a day that is not a business day, the next business day), (y) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(ii), within three (3) business days after such termination or (z) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(iii), within two (2) business days following the Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause (iii)(z) above; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, “Termination Fee” shall mean $60,000,000 in cash. Acceptance by Parent of the Termination Fee shall constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1(e). Payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates (collectively, “Parent Related Parties”) or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.   53








________________


(c) Except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach, Parent’s right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Acquired Corporations and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, employees, partners, stockholders, option holders, managers, members, other Representatives or Affiliates (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of the Termination Fee, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.3(b) are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without those agreements, the Company, Parent and Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to make payment of any amount payable under Section 8.3(b) within the applicable time period specified in Section 8.3(b), as the case may be, and Parent commences a Legal Proceeding to collect such amount that results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall reimburse Parent for its fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such Legal Proceeding and shall pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date the amount was payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), with such interest to accrue beginning on the date such amount first was payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), to the date of payment. 


SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 9.1 Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.4(d), this Agreement may be amended with the approval of the Company Board and the Parent Management Board and the Parent Supervisory Board, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties hereto. 9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. At any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.     54

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger. This Section 9.3 shall not limit any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time. 9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other agreements and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; provided, further, that, if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to Section 9.5(c), in any Legal Proceeding between or among the Parties or their Affiliates arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, each of the Parties (i) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if (but only if) such court declines jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties); (ii) irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 9.9 (provided that nothing in this Section 9.5(a) shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Legal Requirements); and (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court. (b) The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.   55

(c) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties (on behalf of themselves or any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement) shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.5(a) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement or at law or in equity and (ii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The right to specific enforcement hereunder shall include the right of the Company, on behalf of itself and any third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement, to cause Parent and Purchaser to cause the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties (on behalf of themselves or any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement) have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.5(c) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the End Date, any Party brings any Legal Proceeding, in each case in accordance with Section 9.5(a), to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by any other Party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (A) the amount of time during which such Legal Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) business days or (B) such other time period established by the court presiding over such Legal Proceeding, as the case may be. (d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence and that the Parties would suffer ongoing irreparable injury for so long as any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms, including but not limited to as a result of any dispute over the Parties’ obligations to consummate the Transactions. It is accordingly agreed that, as to any Legal Proceedings in which a Party seeks specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to Section 9.5(c) of this Agreement, the Parties shall use their best efforts to seek and obtain an expedited schedule for such proceedings and shall not oppose any Party’s request for expedited proceedings. (e) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH PARTY (A) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 9.5(e).   56

9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall be void and of no effect. 9.7 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except for: (i) if the Offer Acceptance Time occurs (A) the right of the Company’s stockholders to receive the Offer Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to Section 1 or Section 2 following the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (B) the right of the holders of Company Options and Company Warrants to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8; (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 6.4 of this Agreement; and (iii) the limitations on liability of the Company Related Parties set forth in Section 8.3(c); and (C) the right of the Financing Sources in Section 8.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without limitation to the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser expressly acknowledge and agree that the Company shall have the right, on behalf of its stockholders, to pursue damages against Parent and/or Purchaser for the loss of the Offer Price and Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damages based on the loss of the economic benefits of the Offer and the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to each such holder) in the event of any material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser. 9.8 Transfer Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.1(i) and Section 2.6(b), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees imposed with respect to the transfer of Shares pursuant to the Merger shall be borne by the Company, Parent or Purchaser and expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Shares. 9.9 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be delivered to any Party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be sent via email as a .pdf attachment to the email address set forth below (provided that no notice is received by the electronic mail sender within twelve (12) hours thereafter indicating that such electronic mail was undeliverable or otherwise not delivered), with a copy delivered by hand, reliable overnight courier service (providing proof of delivery), or by United States registered or certified mail, postage prepaid (return receipt requested) to the address specified in this subsection:

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Offer and the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   58

(a) there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Shares that, considered together with all other Shares (if any) beneficially owned by Parent and its Affiliates, represent one more Share than 50% of the total number of Shares outstanding at the time of the expiration of the Offer (the “Minimum Condition”); provided, however, that for purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied, the Parties shall exclude Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been “received” (as such term is defined in Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL); (b) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.3(a) (Capitalization, Etc.), Section 3.3(c) (Capitalization, Etc.), Section 3.4 (Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement), Section 3.23 (Takeover Laws) and Section 3.24 (Fairness Opinion) shall be true and correct in all material respects at and as of the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date as if made at and as of the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date or period, in which case as of such date or period); (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.8 (Absence of Changes) shall be true and correct at and as of the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date; (iii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 3.3(a), 3.3(c), 3.4, 3.8, 3.23 and 3.24) that are qualified by a “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct at and as of the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date as if made at and as of the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date or period, in which case as of such date or period);     1

(iv) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 3.3(a), 3.3(c), 3.4, 3.8, 3.23 and 3.24) that are not qualified by a “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct at and as of the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date as if made at and as of the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (c) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material respects the Company’s covenants and agreements it is required to comply with or perform at or prior to the expiration time of the Offer on the Expiration Date; (d) The waiting period (or any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated and any approvals or clearances required to be obtained under the Antitrust Laws shall have been obtained; (e) Parent and Purchaser shall have received a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer confirming that the conditions set forth in clauses (b) through (c) of this Annex I have been duly satisfied; (f) There shall not have been issued by any Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material business operations, and remain in effect any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order preventing the acquisition of or payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger, nor shall there be any Legal Requirement promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger by any Governmental Body in any jurisdiction in which Parent or the Company has material business operations which prohibits, or makes illegal the acquisition of or payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that Parent and Purchaser shall not be permitted to invoke this clause (f) unless they shall have taken all actions required under this Agreement to have any such order lifted; and (g) the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms (the “Termination Condition”). 


The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and (except for the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and clauses (d) and (f) of this Annex I) may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Purchaser.   2

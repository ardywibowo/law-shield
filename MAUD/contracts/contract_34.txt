AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 


AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”), dated as of February 22, 2021, by and among The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, a corporation organized under the Laws of Ohio (“Parent”), Vulcan Merger Sub Inc., a corporation organized under the Laws of Delaware and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”, together with Parent, the “Parent Parties”), and Cooper Tire & Rubber Company, a corporation organized under the Laws of Delaware (the “Company”). 


RECITALS 


WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Parent Parties and the Company each have approved, and in the case of the Company and Merger Sub deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate, the acquisition of the Company by Parent by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of the Common Stock, par value 1.00 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock” and such issued and outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, collectively, the “Shares”), other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, any Shares held in the treasury of the Company and any Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 


WHEREAS, Merger Sub is a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and Parent owns all of the issued and outstanding stock of Merger Sub. 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I 


THE MERGER 


Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation. The Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is referred to in this Agreement as the “Surviving Corporation”. 


Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place at 8:00 a.m. on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of all of the conditions (other than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of any such condition) set forth in ARTICLE VII (the “Closing Date”), at the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019 or remotely by exchange of documents and signatures (or their electronic counterparts) unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement. 


Section 1.3 Effective Time. The parties to this Agreement shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) on the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by Parent and the Company in writing, being the “Effective Time”).








________________


Section 1.4 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 


Section 1.5 Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the restated certificate of incorporation (“Restated Certificate of Incorporation”) and by-laws (“By-Laws”) of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time (a) in the case of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to be in the form set forth in Exhibit A, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to Section 6.7 hereof, and (b) in the case of the By-Laws, to be in the form of the by-laws of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to Section 6.7 hereof, except that all references therein to Merger Sub shall be automatically amended and shall become references to the Surviving Corporation. 


Section 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 


Section 1.7 Subsequent Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in or to be vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 


ARTICLE II 


EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK 


Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent Parties, the Company or the holders of Shares or securities of the Parent Parties: (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b), any Options, Share Units or PUs, which shall each be treated as set forth in Section 2.3) (such Shares, the “Eligible Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive the following consideration (the “Merger Consideration”): (i) $41.75 in cash, without interest, payable to the holder of each Share (the “Per Share Cash Consideration”) and (ii) 0.907 of a share of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Common Stock (the “Exchange Ratio”) upon surrender of either certificates formerly representing such Shares (“Certificates”) or any book-entry Shares (“Book-Entry Shares”) in the manner provided in Section 2.2. All such Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired and cease to exist. Upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2, each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive (x) the Merger Consideration for such   2








________________


Shares upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest, (y) any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been declared by the Company in accordance with this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and any dividends and other distributions payable in accordance with Section 2.2(e) and (z) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Shares in accordance with Section 2.2(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Merger would (as reasonably determined by Parent after good-faith consultation with the Company) otherwise result in the issuance of shares of common stock of Parent, without par value (“Parent Common Stock”) (including shares of Parent Common Stock that would be deliverable pursuant to equity awards pursuant to Section 2.3) in excess of 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Closing (the “Share Cap”), the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced by the smallest number (rounded up to the nearest 0.0001) that causes the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock (including shares of Parent Common Stock that would be deliverable pursuant to equity awards pursuant to Section 2.3 issuable in the Merger) to not exceed the Share Cap (the “Exchange Ratio Reduction Number”), and the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount in cash equal to (x) the Exchange Ratio Reduction Number multiplied by (y) the Parent Closing Price. 


(b) Each (i) Share held in the treasury of the Company, (ii) Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) Dissenting Share ((i)-(iii) collectively, the “Cancelled Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect to such shares subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares, to the right of the holder thereof to receive any payment under Section 2.4. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.1(b) shall not apply to Shares held in trust by the Company, any of the Parent Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Shares that are otherwise set aside from Shares held in the Company’s treasury pursuant to a Company Plan (as such term is defined in Section 3.12(a)). 


(c) Each share of common stock, without par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation and, thereafter, will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 


Section 2.2 Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books. 


(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will enter into an agreement with Parent’s or the Company’s transfer agent (or another U.S. national bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration and the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(a). At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in a separate account for the benefit of holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance with this ARTICLE II through the Exchange Agent, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions payable to holders of Eligible Shares, including pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f). The Exchange Agent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 2.2(a) and Section 2.2(e) and Section 2.2(f), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Exchange Fund”. 


(b) 


(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event within two Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will   3

pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(h)) to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in customary form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(h)) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent for such holder. Upon delivery of a valid letter of transmittal and the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(h)) or Book-Entry Shares on or before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to each holder of Eligible Shares (x) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and (y) a check or wire transfer (as specified in the applicable letter of transmittal) in the amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (including in respect of any dividends and other distributions which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(f)). Until so surrendered, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Cancelled Shares) will represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(h)) or Book-Entry Shares. 


(ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration or any other amount under this ARTICLE II (including any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other similar Taxes and fees incurred by a holder of Shares in connection with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be the responsibility solely of such holder. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) shall be made to the Person in whose name such Book- Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a transfer of ownership of Book-Entry Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent may make payment of the proper amount of aggregate Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) to such transferee if written instructions authorizing the transfer of the Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent and are accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that such Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of such Book-Entry Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 


(c) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Eligible Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay (x) any dividends or make any other distributions, in each case with a record date (A) prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (B) prior to   4

the date of this Agreement, and in each case which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, (y) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (z) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f). At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed immediately and there will not be any further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing Cancelled Shares, except for Dissenting Shares which shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.4) or Book-Entry Shares (other than Book-Entry Shares representing Cancelled Shares, except for Dissenting Shares which shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.4) are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) as provided in this ARTICLE II. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash or other consideration payable pursuant to this ARTICLE II or otherwise upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares which immediately before the Effective Time represented the Shares. 


(d) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will deliver to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, any cash, including any interest received with respect to such cash, and any certificates or other documents in its possession relating to the Transactions, which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or previously delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest on such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent will be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in each case, until such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Section 2.2. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends or distributions with a record time after the Effective Time pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.   5

(f) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock for the 10 consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. (the “Parent Closing Price”). As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the payment of cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. 


(g) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(f)) otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.4, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or other securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 


(h) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or, at the election of Parent or the Exchange Agent, a bond in such customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will, if such holder has otherwise delivered a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate as contemplated by this ARTICLE II.

Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2(d). To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the   6

Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Stock Plans. 


(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (an “Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be adjusted and converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Equivalent over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock set forth in such Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the “Option Cash Payment”), and as of the Effective Time each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. The Option Cash Payment shall be made at the time required under the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award or other applicable document, but in any event promptly (and no later than 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time. 


(b) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan (other than awards of Options, the treatment of which is specified in Section 2.3(a)) entitling the holder thereof to shares of Company Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of Shares (a “Share Unit”) that is outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall, except as provided below for the 2022 Share Units (as defined below), be adjusted and converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the “Share Unit Payment”) in respect of a number of shares of Company Common Stock determined as follows (i) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-based vesting conditions which have been notionally earned by an employee for measurement periods completed prior to the Effective Time but not yet settled, the number of shares of Company Common Stock determined based on actual achievement of the applicable performance goals for such measurement periods, (ii) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-based vesting conditions for a measurement period that has begun and is not complete as of the Effective Time (and which as a result have not been notionally earned by an employee prior to the Effective Time), the number of shares of Company Common Stock determined as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved for such measurement period at the target level of performance, prorated for the number of days between the commencement of the applicable measurement period and the Effective Time as compared to the number of days in the entire measurement period, and (iii) in the case of Share Units not subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Share Units. Share Units first granted by the Company in 2022 (the “2022 Share Units”) will be adjusted and converted at the Effective Time as described in Section 5.1(a)(iii)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter. As of the Effective Time each holder of a Share Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except (A) the right to receive the Share Unit Payment, (B) as described in Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (C) as provided in Section 5.1(a)(iii)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter for the 2022 Share Units. The Share Unit Payment shall be made at the time required under the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award or other applicable document, but in any event promptly (and no later than 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time; provided, however, in the event that making such payment at such time would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with respect to a Share Unit, the payment shall instead be made at the time specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award or other applicable document. 


(c) Each performance cash unit granted under the Company Stock Plans (“PU”) that is outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall, except as provided below for the 2022 PUs (as defined below), be adjusted and converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, less any required withholding Taxes (the “PU Payment”), equal to the product of (i) the sum of (A) in the case of PUs which have been notionally earned by an employee for measurement periods completed prior to the Effective Time but not yet settled, the number of PUs determined based on actual achievement of the applicable   7

performance goals for such measurement periods and (B) in the case of PUs for a measurement period that has begun and is not complete as of the Effective Time (and which as a result have not been notionally earned by an employee prior to the Effective Time), the number of PUs determined as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved for such measurement period at the target level of performance, prorated for the number of days between the commencement of the applicable measurement period and the Effective Time as compared to the number of days in the entire measurement period, and (ii) $1. PUs first granted by the Company in 2022 (the “2022 PUs”) will be adjusted and converted at the Effective Time as described in Section 5.1(a)(iii)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The PU Payment shall be made at the time required under the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award or other applicable document, but in any event promptly (and no later than 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time; provided, however, in the event that making such payment at such time would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with respect to a PU, the payment shall instead be made at the time specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award or other applicable document. As of the Effective Time each holder of a PU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except (x) the right to receive the PU Payment, (y) as described in Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (z) as provided in Section 5.1(a)(iii)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter for the 2022 PUs. 


(d) All account balances (whether or not vested) under any Company Plan (other than awards under a Company Stock Plan the treatment of which is specified in Section 2.3(a), (b) or (c)) that provides for the deferral of compensation and represents amounts notionally invested in a number of shares of Company Common Stock or otherwise provides for distributions or benefits that are calculated based on the value of a Share (collectively, the “Deferred Compensation Plans”), shall be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to have allocated to the holder’s account under any such Deferred Compensation Plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock deemed invested under or otherwise referenced by such account as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Per Share Cash Equivalent (the “Deferred Payment”), and shall cease to represent a right to receive a number of shares of Company Common Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of a number of Shares. The Deferred Payment, less any required withholding Taxes, shall be made at the time specified in the applicable Deferred Compensation Plan and related plan documents. 


(e) Each share of Company Common Stock that remains available for issuance pursuant to any Company Stock Plan as of the Effective Time (the “Residual Shares”) shall, in accordance with such Company Stock Plan, be converted at the Effective Time into the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of such Residual Shares and the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (such shares of Parent Common Stock, the “Assumed Shares”). 


(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such lawful actions as may be necessary (which include satisfying the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), without incurring any liability in connection therewith, to provide for and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3. 


(g) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any further corporate action, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plans, with the result that Parent may issue the Assumed Shares after the Effective Time pursuant to equity awards granted under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates. 


Section 2.4 Dissenters’ Rights. Shares that have not been voted for adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which appraisal has been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (“Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time unless and until the holder of such shares withdraws such demand for such appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal, but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting   8








________________


Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by Section 262 of the DGCL). If a holder of Dissenting Shares withdraws such demand for appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such holder’s Dissenting Shares will cease to be a Dissenting Share and will be converted as of the Effective Time into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating to stockholders’ rights of appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable Law. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable Law, or waive any failure by any holder of Company Common Stock to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by any such holder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.12 Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans; ERISA. 


(a) As used herein, the term “Company Plan” shall mean each material employee benefit plan (including “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)), “voluntary employees’ beneficiary associations” under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (each, a “VEBA”) and each other material equity incentive, compensation, severance, employment, change-in-control, termination, retention, fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, stock-based, savings, retirement, deferred compensation, health and welfare, or other benefit plan, agreement, program, policy or Contract, whether or not subject to ERISA (including any related funding mechanism), in each case other than a “multiemployer plan,” as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (“Multiemployer Plan”), under which (i) any current or former employee, officer, director, contractor or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (“Covered Service Providers”) has any present or future right to benefits and which are entered into, contributed to, sponsored by or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability. With respect to each Company Plan, the Company has made available to Parent, to the extent applicable, true, correct and complete copies of (1) all documents embodying such Company Plan, including all amendments thereto and all related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles, (2) written descriptions of any Company Plans that are not set forth in a written document, (3) the most recent summary plan description for each applicable Company Plan, together with the summary or summaries of material modifications thereto, (4) the two most recent annual actuarial valuations, (5) the most recent determination or opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to any Company Plan and related trust intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and any pending request for such a determination letter and (6) the two most recent annual reports (Form 5500 or 990 series and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto).   18








________________


(b) Each Company Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code and, since the date that is six years prior to the date hereof, has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and all such applicable Laws. All contributions required to be made under each Company Plan, as of the date of this Agreement, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each Company Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Financial Statements prior to the date of this Agreement.

No “reportable event” within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the 30-day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred during the six year period ending on the date hereof with respect to any Company Plan or will be required to be filed in connection with the Transactions, nor has any event described in Sections 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA occurred with respect to any Company Plan. 


(e) No Company Plan that is an “employee pension benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA which is a single- employer plan (a “Pension Plan”) had a “funding shortfall” within the meaning of Section 430(c) of the Code or Section 303(c) of ERISA as of the Applicable Date, and there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result of a change in the funding method, of such Pension Plan since the Applicable Date. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate participates in, or has within the six years prior to the date of this Agreement participated in, any Multiemployer Plan.

(j) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Company Plan, (i) there has not occurred any prohibited transaction in which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Covered Service Providers or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of such Company Plan or trust created thereunder, in each case, who is not a Covered Service Provider (a “Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary”), has engaged that would subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Covered Service Providers or any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or any other applicable Law and (ii) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Covered Service Providers or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a manner, that would subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Covered Service Providers or any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary to any liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable Law. 


(k) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any Covered Service Provider to any material severance pay, material unemployment compensation or any other material payment, (ii) materially accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount of compensation due any Covered Service Provider, or result in any funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under any of the Company Plans, (iii) result in any violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or limit to the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ ability to amend, modify or terminate, any Company Plan or (iv) require a “gross-up” or other payment to any “disqualified individual” within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code due to the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code on any payment to such disqualified individual or result in payments under any of the Company Plans that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. The Company has made available to Parent complete copies of the Section 280G calculations prepared with respect to the individuals set forth in Section 3.12(k) of the Company Disclosure Letter in connection with the Transactions. 


Section 3.13 Labor Matters. 


(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (i) a party to or otherwise bound by any Company Labor Agreement, and (ii) the subject of any material Action that asserts that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or that seeks to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization.

To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof there are no material organizing efforts with respect to the formation of a collective bargaining unit involving any Covered Service Provider. 


(b) The Company has previously made available to Parent correct and complete copies of all collective bargaining agreements, material labor agreements or other material Contracts with a labor union, works council, other labor organization or bargaining unit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which any of them are otherwise bound (collectively, the “Company Labor Agreements”). The execution of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will not (i) entitle any third party (including any labor union, works council or labor organization) to any material payments under any of the Company Labor Agreements or (ii) require consent or notification of any labor union, works council or labor organization under any of the Company Labor Agreements, applicable Law or otherwise. 


(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices (including equal employment opportunity laws), terms and conditions of employment, workers’ compensation, occupational safety and health, affirmative action, employee privacy, plant closings, immigration, classification and wages and hours, except where non-compliance would   20

(g) The Company also agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such Person’s consideration of an acquisition of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives and the Company will immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access for any such Person and any of its Representatives to diligence or other information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company further agrees to enforce the standstill provisions of any such agreement and shall take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been granted to any Person other than Parent or its Affiliates under any confidentiality or standstill provisions in any such agreement, except if and to the extent that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the taking of any action in connection with the foregoing would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board under applicable Law. 


(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.2, any action, or failure to take action, that is taken by a director or officer of the Company, in violation of this Section 5.2, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.2 by the Company. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent any other employee or Representative of the Company from taking any action or failing to take any action in violation of this Section 5.2.   44

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 


Section 6.1 Preparation of Proxy Statement. 


(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event, within 30 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and caused to be filed with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be a part. Each of Parent and the Company will use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) ensure that the Registration Statement complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act and kept effective for so long as necessary to consummate the Merger, and (iii) for the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC and its staff under the Exchange Act, in each case, as promptly as practicable after such initial filing. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the holders of the Shares, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five Business Days) after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. Subject to Section 5.2, the Proxy Statement will contain the Company Recommendation and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Stockholder Approval. 


(b) Each party will provide the other party for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, all required information relating to such party or its Affiliates and holders of their respective shares as the party making such filing may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement (as applicable) and any amendments or supplements thereto. Each party and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement, as applicable, before it is filed with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent will provide the other party and its counsel, in writing, any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that it or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, as applicable, promptly after the receipt of such comments or other communications, and the opportunity to review and comment on such comments. Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any such comments from the SEC or its staff concerning the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the filing of the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response). 


(c) Each of the Company and the Parent Parties agrees to promptly (i) correct any information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement or Registration Statement, as applicable, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement or Registration Statement, as applicable, to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy Statement or Registration Statement, as applicable, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent shall (x) advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated, and (y) use its reasonable best efforts to take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or “blue sky” Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent   45

Common Stock in the Merger (and the Company shall reasonably cooperate and furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such actions). 


Section 6.2 Stockholders Meeting. 


(a) Subject to Section 5.2, the Company shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, its constituent documents and the rules of the NYSE to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Stockholders Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement, which mailing shall take place as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company or, only in the case of clause (iii) below and on no more than one occasion, Parent upon written request to the Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent; provided that after consultation with Parent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Stockholders Meeting if such disclosure is determined by the Company in good faith after consultation with outside counsel to be required to be provided to the stockholders of the Company, (ii) if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting or (iii) for a single period not to exceed 15 Business Days, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to obtain the Stockholder Approval; provided, however, in the case of any of the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii), unless otherwise agreed to by each of Parent and the Company, (x) the Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than 15 Business Days after the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood, subject to this clause (x) and the following clause (y), that the Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed by the Company every time the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii) exist) and (y) in no event may the Company postpone the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent if doing so would require the setting of a new record date. 


(b) Without the prior written consent of Parent or as required by applicable Law, (i) the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than a non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Transactions and matters of procedure) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders Meeting and the Company shall not submit any other proposal to such stockholders in connection with the Stockholders Meeting or otherwise (including any proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions) (other than, if the Stockholders Meeting is also the Company’s annual stockholders meeting, proposals customarily brought in connection with the Company’s annual stockholder meeting) and (ii) the Company shall not call any meeting of the stockholders of the Company other than the Stockholders Meeting (other than, if the Stockholders Meeting is not combined with the Company’s annual stockholder meeting, the Company’s annual stockholders meeting); provided that the Stockholders Meeting may only be combined with the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders (x) upon a good faith determination by the Company in consultation with Parent that such a combination would not be reasonably likely to cause a material impediment to the ability of the Company to conduct the business required to be addressed at the Stockholders Meeting and (y) with Parent’s prior written consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company shall otherwise coordinate and cooperate with Parent with respect to the timing of the Stockholders Meeting and shall provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for the Stockholders Meeting (including interim results) as reasonably requested by Parent. 


(c) Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then beneficially owned by it, Merger Sub or any of its other Subsidiaries and Affiliates in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.   46

Section 6.3 Reasonable Best Efforts. 


(a) Prior to the Closing, the Parent Parties and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective in the most reasonably expeditious manner possible the Transactions including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Transactions, (ii) the satisfaction of all of the conditions to consummating the Transactions, (iii) taking all actions necessary to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information required under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws or applicable FDI Laws and in connection with approvals of or filings with any other Governmental Entity) required to be obtained or made by the Parent Parties, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially impede, materially interfere with or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, including the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to Closing. 


(b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this Agreement with respect to and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, promptly provide any relevant information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) copies of), and keep the other parties apprised of the status of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions. If any party to this Agreement or any Representative of such parties receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and, to the extent permitted by Law, after consultation with the other parties to this Agreement and permitting counsel to the other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Each party agrees that it will not participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person, by telephone or by other medium, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the performance of its obligations pursuant to Section 6.3(a) unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. The Company and Parent shall jointly devise the strategy and direct all matters for obtaining clearances, approvals or waiting-period expirations under Antitrust Laws or applicable FDI Laws, including any filings, notifications, submissions and communications with or to any Governmental Entity in connection therewith; provided, however, that Parent shall not commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the Company’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided further, the parties shall respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests for documentation or information or any request for additional information (a “second request”) received from the FTC or the DOJ (but in any event each party shall substantially comply with such request within four months of such request being issued unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the other party) and to all inquiries and requests received from any other Governmental Entity in connection with any other applicable Antitrust Laws or FDI Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any dispute between the parties relating to the strategy or appropriate course of action or content of any submission made in connection with obtaining any clearances under applicable Antitrust Laws or applicable FDI Laws with respect to the Transactions (other than those matters specifically discussed in the provisos of the prior sentence), the parties shall escalate such dispute to the general counsels of the Company and Parent for resolution which resolution   47








________________


will be undertaken by them in good faith; provided, however, that if after such escalation the parties are unable to resolve such dispute, then Parent shall have the right to make such determination. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6.3(b) but subject to the Parent Parties’ obligations in Section 6.3(a), Parent shall have the ultimate right to determine the nature of any Remedy Action to be taken by the Parent Parties for the purpose of securing any required approvals under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws or any applicable FDI Laws. 


(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act, and the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file (including, for the avoidance of doubt, making any initial filing with an applicable Governmental Entity), as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 45 Business Days after the date of this Agreement (unless the applicable Governmental Entity has indicated to any of the parties hereto that such Governmental Entity would not accept such initial filing at such time, in which case, the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to make such filing as promptly as reasonably practicable after such Governmental Entity indicates that it will accept such initial filing), any other filings and/or notifications under applicable Antitrust Laws or applicable FDI Laws, and, if applicable, requesting early termination of any waiting period with respect to the Transactions, and to file as soon as practicable any other applicable notifications or other forms and documentation necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals under or in connection with any applicable Antitrust Law or applicable FDI Law or in connection with the approval or authorization of or filings with any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by the Parent Parties, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to respond, as promptly as practicable, to any inquiries and requests received from the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and to respond, as promptly as practicable, to all inquiries and requests for additional information and documentation received from any state Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity in connection with approvals of or filings with any other Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by the Parent Parties, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement. 


(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions under applicable Antitrust Laws or applicable FDI Laws. In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the Transactions as violative of the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and any other United States federal or state or foreign Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, “Antitrust Laws”) or otherwise challenged by any Governmental Entity (including pursuant to any applicable FDI Laws), each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest, resist and litigate any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction, Restraint or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or any other Transactions, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.3 shall limit the right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 in accordance with the terms thereof. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws or other applicable FDI Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. 


(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Parent Parties shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, take any and all actions required to obtain all required approvals under the HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws and applicable FDI Laws and the Parent Parties shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect   48

to, any requirement, condition, limitation, contract or Order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates in any manner or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates (excluding for purposes of clauses (i) – (iii) any of the assets set forth on Section 6.3(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter) (any of the foregoing a “Remedy Action”); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (x) no Parent Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to take (and, without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures (subject to Section 6.19) will take or agree to take) any action (including any Remedy Action) that, individually or in the aggregate with all other actions (including any Remedy Actions) pursuant to this Section 6.3 would or would reasonably be expected to result in or be a Burdensome Condition and (y) if requested by Parent, the Company will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action (including any Remedy Action) with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or Order so long as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or Order is only binding on the Company in the event the Closing occurs. To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in this Section 6.3, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Burdensome Condition” means the executing or carrying out, consenting to or to offer to or to agree to, or otherwise take any action (including any Remedy Action) with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement (including consent decrees and undertakings) in respect of, in anticipation of or pursuant to any action contemplated by this Section 6.3 that, individually or in the aggregate with all other such actions pursuant to this Section 6.3, would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures). 


Section 6.4 Notification of Certain Matters. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence would be reasonably likely to cause any condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied and (b) any material failure of the Company or any Parent Party, as the case may be, or any Representative of the Company or Parent Party, as applicable, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the party receiving such notice. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any written notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person in connection with a Material Contract is or may be required in connection with the Transactions. 


Section 6.5 Access; Confidentiality. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, the Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, Parent and its Representatives, from time to time prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, reasonable access during normal business hours to (i) the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records and (ii) such other information as Parent shall reasonably request with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial condition and operations, in each case, to the extent related to consummation of the Transactions or the ownership or operation of the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company, after consultation with legal counsel, would (i) result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or third parties, (ii) result in the disclosure of competitively sensitive sales and marketing information of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to   49








________________


obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (iii) cause competitive harm to the Company if the Transactions are not consummated, (b) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (c) except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, provide any information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures in any format other than as it exists, or otherwise to manipulate or reconfigure any data regarding the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ business, assets, financial performance or conditions or operations if the foregoing cannot be done without undue effort by, or an unreasonable dedication of resources or personnel of, the Company and its Subsidiaries. If the Company seeks to withhold information from the Parent Parties for any reason permitted by this Section 6.5, the Company and the Parent Parties shall cooperate to implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may satisfy its obligations set forth above by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under applicable Law or as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures. No investigation or information provided pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein. All information provided shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 


Section 6.6 Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press release. Thereafter neither the Company nor the Parent Parties shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior consultation and consent of the other party (with such consultation to include giving the other party the opportunity to review and comment on such press release or other announcement), except (a) to the extent required by Law or (b) required by any listing agreement with or rules of any applicable national securities exchange, trading market or listing authority, or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required by this Section 6.6 to provide any such review or comment to the Parent Parties in connection with the receipt and existence of a Company Takeover Proposal, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, a party may, without consultation with, or the consent of the other party, issue one or more press releases or public statements that are consistent with prior press releases issued or public statements made in compliance with this Section 6.6 or any communication plan or strategy previously agreed to by Parent and the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.6 shall prevent Parent or the Company from issuing any press release or making any public statement in the ordinary course that does not relate specifically to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 


Section 6.7 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. 


(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director or officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or any other Person that is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Company, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, (the “Indemnified Party”) with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or any such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person) or (ii) acts or omissions by such Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Party’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under (i) or (ii), at, or   50








________________


at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the Merger or the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law or that the Company would have been required under its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date of this Agreement (and made available to the Parent Parties), to indemnify such Indemnified Party. In addition, from the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnified Party under this Section 6.7 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 6.7) as incurred to the fullest extent that the Company would have been required under its certificate of incorporation or by-laws, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, provided that the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.7(a). 


(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will assume all obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in respect of rights of exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the respective constituent documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any written Contract described on the Company Disclosure Letter or filed as an exhibit to any document filed with the SEC; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made in accordance with the applicable provisions thereof will continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time, will cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company’s constituent documents, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties. 


(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries, or provide substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a “tail policy” with reputable insurers, in each case of at least the same coverage and scope, and in amounts, and containing terms and conditions, that are no less favorable to such individuals than such policy in effect on the date hereof, with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time covering without limitation the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that after the Effective Time, Parent will not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case will purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; and provided further, that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a “tail policy” and the same coverage costs on an annual basis more than 300% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 300% of such last annual premium. The Company may prior to the Effective Time purchase a six-year prepaid “tail policy” on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall not pay an aggregate amount for such policy in excess of 450% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for the existing policy, and the Company shall reasonably consult with Parent regarding the purchase of such “tail policy” prior to the purchase of such “tail policy”. If such prepaid “tail policy” has been obtained by the Company, it will be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.7(c) and the Surviving Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.   51

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 will survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the Company’s constituent documents, by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7 may not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.7 applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.7 applies will be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7). 


(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. 


Section 6.8 Parent and Company Compliance. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 


Section 6.9 Employee Matters. 


(a) From the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of employment were not, and do not become, subject to a Company Labor Agreement (the “Company Non-Union Employees”) (i) cash compensation (excluding equity and long-term incentive awards) that is no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the cash compensation (excluding equity and long-term incentive awards) provided to each such Company Non-Union Employee immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) equity and long-term incentive award opportunities that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the equity and long-term incentive award opportunities provided by Parent to its similarly situated employees, (iii) benefits (excluding severance benefits and equity and long-term incentive awards) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than either the benefits (excluding severance benefits and equity and long-term incentive awards) provided to each such Company Non-Union Employee immediately before the Effective Time or such benefits (excluding severance benefits and equity and long-term incentive awards) provided by Parent to its similarly situated employees, as determined by Parent, and (iv) severance benefits upon a termination without cause and subject to a release of claims that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the severance benefits provided to each such Company Non-Union Employee immediately before the Effective Time (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be the Merger Severance Plan (as defined in Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter) for any such Company Non-Union Employees who are eligible to participate in such plan, as set forth on Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter). As to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of employment were subject to a Company Labor Agreement (the “Company Union Employees”), the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with the terms and conditions of each applicable Company Labor Agreement, in a manner consistent with applicable Law. 


(b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor all compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies, practices or agreements maintained or sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, as such plans, programs, policies, practices or agreements are in effect on the date hereof (it being understood that this Section 6.9(b) shall not be deemed to prohibit Parent or its affiliates from amending, modifying, replacing or terminating such arrangements in accordance with their terms).   52

(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual (other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any pension plan sponsored by Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Non-Union Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Non-Union Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries or predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Non-Union Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Non-Union Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Non-Union Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Plan in which such Company Non-Union Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Transactions (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Non-Union Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 


(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as applicable, will take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 


(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue the Company’s annual bonus programs (the “AIP”) for the remainder of the performance period in which the Closing occurs and shall pay bonuses to the Company Non-Union Employees pursuant to the AIP in respect of the full performance period in which the Closing occurs, in accordance with the terms of the AIP as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, and such bonus payments shall be paid at the time such bonus payments would have otherwise been paid absent the consummation of the Merger; provided that Parent shall, in its sole discretion (exercised in good faith), determine the level of achievement and the amount payable to each Company Non-Union Employee under the AIP, consistent with the methodologies used and determinations made by the Company for payouts under the AIP for the immediately preceding performance period, with the results adjusted to reflect the impact of the Transactions, including any expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the Transactions; provided further, that any such bonus payments made to participants in the Company’s Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Pay Plan (the “CIC Severance Plan”) will be reduced to the extent that the participant received a prorated payment of the participant’s AIP bonus upon the Closing for the performance period in which the Closing occurs pursuant to the CIC Severance Plan. 


(f) Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan. The provisions of this Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.9, express or implied, shall confer upon any Covered Service Provider, Company Non-Union Employee and Company Union Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement.   53

Section 6.10 Merger Sub Approval. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting the plan of merger contained in this Agreement. 


Section 6.11 Financing. 


(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Parent Party shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (including in the event of the failure by the Company to deliver the Required Company Financial Statements) to take (or cause to be taken) all action and to do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and consummate the Financing contemplated by the Financing Documents (including any applicable “market flex” provisions), including (i) maintaining in effect the Financing Documents (including any applicable market flex provisions), (ii) negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto (which, with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Committed Financing) on terms and conditions that are in the aggregate not materially less favorable to Parent Parties than those contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including, to the extent applicable, any “market flex” provisions) (which may include amending any or all of the Commitment Letter and any related fee letter from time to time between the date hereof and the Closing to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as a party thereto and the Parent Parties shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment or modification), provided that such terms do not (1) reduce the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds available from the Financing below an amount that would be sufficient to satisfy the Financing Purposes, (2) introduce new or additional conditions or that otherwise prevent, impede, delay or impair the availability of the Financing or the ability of the Parent Parties to consummate the Merger as of the Closing in any respect or (3) adversely impact the ability of any Parent Party to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Documents in any respect (any such agreements, the “Financing Definitive Agreements”), and deliver to the Company a copy thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable (and no later than two Business Days) after such execution, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis (and in any event, on or prior to the Closing) all conditions applicable to the Parent Parties set forth in the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements within their control (including, if applicable, timely preparing the necessary offering circulars, private placement memoranda or other offering documents or marketing materials with respect to the Financing), (iv) consummating the Financing contemplated by the Financing Documents at or prior to the Closing, (v) enforcing the obligations of the other parties to the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements (and the rights of the Parent Parties), and (vi) complying in all material respects with its covenants and other obligations under the Financing Documents. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Parent Party will permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Documents to the extent such amendment, supplement, other modification or waiver would (1) reduce the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds available from the Financing below an amount that would be sufficient to satisfy the Financing Purposes, (2) introduce new or additional conditions that would prevent, impede, delay, impair or reduce the availability of the Financing or the ability of the Parent Parties to consummate the Merger as of the Closing in any respect or (3) adversely impact the ability of any Parent Party to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Documents in any material respect; provided that Parent Parties may amend, supplement or modify the Financing Documents for the purpose of adding agents, coagents, lenders, arrangers, joint bookrunners or other Persons that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, in each case in accordance with the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof so long as such amendment, supplement or modification is otherwise in compliance with this Section 6.11. The Parent Parties will deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification, replacement or waiver as promptly as reasonably practicable (and no later than two Business Days) after the execution thereof. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Parent Parties may cancel or terminate a portion of the commitments provided under the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements to the extent the Parent Parties have (x) completed an offering of debt securities and received proceeds in an amount of the commitments so cancelled or terminated so long as (A) such cash proceeds are subject to an escrow reasonably acceptable to the Company and (B) no term or condition related to such transaction is reasonably likely to prevent, impede, delay or impair the availability of   54

the Financing (other than the portion so cancelled or terminated) or the ability of the Parent Parties to consummate the Merger as of the Closing or (y) otherwise subjected available cash to an escrow reasonably acceptable to the Company. 


(b) Upon reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall keep the Company informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) notify the Company of (i) the expiration or termination of the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements, (ii) any refusal by the other parties to the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements to provide, any written notice or other written communication by the other parties to the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements of any intention to refuse to provide, or asserting that it no longer has an obligation and/or ability to provide, the full financing contemplated by the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements, (iii) any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Documents or Financing Definitive Agreements the effect of which would relieve the Financing Sources from the obligation to provide the Financing in any manner (including in diminution of amount) or would reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of any portion of the funding of the Financing and (iv) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from a Financing Source with respect to any (x) actual or potential material breach, material default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Documents or any Financing Definitive Agreements or any provisions of the Financing Documents or any Financing Definitive Agreements the effect of which would relieve the Financing Sources from the obligation to provide the Financing or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Documents or any Financing Definitive Agreements the effect of which would relieve the Financing Sources from the obligation to provide the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent be required to provide any information under this Section 6.11 if such disclosure would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege. 


(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable (including as a result of the failure by the Company to deliver the Required Company Financial Statements) on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements (it being understood that Parent shall be required to exercise any applicable market flex provisions) or any of the Financing Documents or Financing Definitive Agreements shall be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded, in each case regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event, within two Business Days) notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient to replace such unavailable portion of the Financing) from the same or other sources; provided that in no event shall Parent be obligated to obtain alternative debt financing on terms and conditions that are in the aggregate materially less favorable to the Parent Parties than such unavailable Financing (including any applicable market flex provision). 


(d) Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements (including any fee letters and engagement letters, provided that fee amounts, pricing, “market flex” provisions and “securities demand” provisions may be redacted, in each case, so long as such redacted provisions would not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, amount or availability of the Financing) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide any of the Parent Parties with any portion of the Financing. Any alternative financing will (x) be in an amount, when added to any portion of the Financing that is available sufficient to satisfy the Financing Purposes and (y) not impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would (i) delay or prevent the Closing in any material respect or (ii) make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur in any material respect. In the event any alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 6.11 (“Alternative Financing”), references in this Agreement to the Financing shall be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing (in lieu of the Financing replaced thereby, and except for purposes of Section 5.1(c)), and if one or more commitment letters, facility agreements or definitive   55








________________


agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letter and the Financing Definitive Agreements shall be deemed to refer to such commitment letters, facility agreements and definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing (in lieu of the Commitment Letter and the Financing Definitive Agreements replaced thereby), and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parent’s obligations with respect to the Financing replaced thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.11 will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of the Parent Parties be deemed or construed to require, any Parent Party to pay any fees, any interest rates or other amounts applicable to the Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Documents (after the exercise of any market flex provisions) or to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise; provided that the Parent Parties shall pay all fees required by the Financing Documents as they become due. The Parent Parties hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its respective obligation to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII. 


(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives, including legal, finance and accounting Representatives, to provide, to the Parent Parties, at Parent’s sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and the Other Financing Matters or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing, in each case with respect to the Financing, to the extent such cooperation is customarily provided for financings of the type contemplated by the Commitment Letter (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including, in each case of the Financing and the Other Financing Matters, using reasonable best efforts to (it being understood and agreed that, solely for purposes of the immediately succeeding clauses (i) through (vii) and the proviso at the end of this clause (e), each reference therein to “the Financing” shall be deemed to be a reference to “the Financing and the Other Financing Matters”): (i) furnish the Parent Parties as promptly as practicable following Parent’s reasonable request and to the extent available and reasonably necessary for the Financing, (A) audited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income (or operations), comprehensive income, equity (or shareholders’ equity) and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and each fiscal year ended after the date hereof and at least 60 days prior to the Closing Date and unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income (or operations), comprehensive income, equity (or shareholders’ equity) and cash flows for each fiscal quarter ended after the date hereof and at least 40 days before the Closing Date, which financial statements shall meet in all material respects the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, and all other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to a registration statement under such Act on Form S-3, provided that the Company’s public filing of its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q shall satisfy the requirements of this Section 6.11(e)(i) and shall be deemed to be such information to have been delivered under this Agreement (the “Required Company Financial Statements”) and (B) information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including information to be used in the preparation of one or more information packages (including customary confidential information, memoranda, offering circulars or prospectuses) regarding the business, operations and business plan or budget of the Company and its Subsidiaries) customary for the placement, arrangement, rating, issuance and/or syndication of loans and/or debt securities as contemplated by the Financing Documents, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent to assist in preparation of customary offering or information documents or rating agency or lender or investor presentations relating to such placement, arrangement, rating, issuance and/or syndication of loans and/or debt securities; provided that any memoranda or prospectuses need not be issued by the Company or any of its Affiliates (provided that, in the event of any failure by the Company to deliver the Required Company Financial Statements, upon the written request of the Company, Parent shall provide to the Company all cooperation reasonably requested by the Company in order for the Company to be able to provide the Required Company   56

Financial Statements so long as any such requested cooperation can be done without causing an undue burden on Parent); 


(ii) participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing, in each case, at reasonable times and locations to be mutually agreed (which may, at the sole election of the Company, be virtual or telephonic) and upon reasonable notice; 


(iii) request the Company’s accountants provide comfort letters relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries customary for financings similar to the Financing and consent to the use of the related audit reports in any offering documents related to the Financing, in each case, as reasonably requested by Parent; 


(iv) assist Parent in its preparation of one or more credit agreements, note purchase agreements, indentures, purchase agreements, registration rights agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements, or other Contracts; provided that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Contracts or amendments shall be effective until the Effective Time; 


(v) in connection with the Financing contemplated by the Financing Documents, provide customary authorization letters to the Financing Source authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders; 


(vi) assist the Parent Parties in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings and, if applicable, facility ratings from any ratings agency relating to the Financing and a public credit rating for the notes related to the Financing from each of such rating agencies; and 


(vii) provide at least three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing all documentation and other information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries required by applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in writing at least 10 Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing; 


provided, however, that (w) none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any their Representatives shall be required to provide, and the Parent Parties shall be solely responsible for, (1) the preparation of pro forma financial information, including pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any pro forma financial information, (2) any description of all or any component of the Financing, including any such description to be included in any liquidity or capital resources disclosure or any “description of notes”, (3) projections, risk factors or other forward-looking statements relating to all or any component of the Financing, (4) subsidiary financial statements or any other information of the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, and (5) Compensation Disclosure and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K, (x) the Company or its Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall not be required to provide any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under Law or Contract or is legally privileged, (y) no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Contract, certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time (other than customary authorization letters referred to in clause (v) above) and (z) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries’ logos in connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the cooperation of the Company under this Section 6.11(e) at any time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the Closing Date. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and   57

its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.11 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than historical information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if (i) the Company has failed to deliver the Required Company Financial Statements and (ii) the Financing (or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing) is unavailable, despite Parent’s reasonable best efforts hereunder, as a direct result of the Company’s failure to deliver the Required Company Financial Statements, then Parent shall not be required to consummate the Transactions unless and until such time that the Company has delivered the Required Company Financial Statements and the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 are satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) (other than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of any such condition). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b), as it applies to the Company’s obligations under this Section 6.11(e), shall be deemed satisfied unless the Company has taken or failed to take an action deliberately and with knowledge that the action so taken or omitted constituted a breach of its obligations under this Section  6.11(e) and such breach has been the proximate cause of the Financing not being obtained. 


Section  6.12 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Transactions, the Company Board or a duly authorized committee thereof shall grant such approvals and will use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise will use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions. 


Section 6.13 Director Resignations. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the Company and, as reasonably requested by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, who are in office immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


Section 6.14 Stockholder Litigation. In the event that any stockholder litigation related to this Agreement or the Transactions is brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company and/or the members of the Company Board prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) promptly notify Parent and keep Parent informed with respect to the status thereof and (ii) provide Parent with the opportunity to participate (but not control) in the defense or settlement of such litigation; provided that the Company shall not cease to defend, consent to the entry of any judgement, settle or offer to settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 


Section 6.15 Coordination of Quarterly Dividends. If Parent has resumed its quarterly dividend (and provided that Parent has provided prior written notice to the Company of its intentions to resume its quarterly dividend), Parent and the Company shall each coordinate their record and payment dates for their regular quarterly dividends to ensure that the holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their Company Common Stock and the Parent Common Stock that such holders receive in exchange therefor in the Merger. In addition, and without limiting the requirements of the previous sentence, the Company shall ensure that the date on which any quarterly dividend is declared and the record date with respect to any quarterly dividend shall be (x) no later than five Business Days following and (y) no earlier than two Business Days preceding, in each case, the one year anniversary of such dates for the corresponding quarter of the preceding year; provided, however, that in the quarter in which the Closing occurs, if the record date of Parent’s quarterly dividend has been declared and is a date prior to the Effective Time, then such quarterly dividend declaration date and record date of the Company shall occur no later than such date as is necessary to ensure that holders of Company Common Stock receive a quarterly dividend in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 6.15.   58

Section 6.16 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall take all necessary action to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be listed on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance. 


Section 6.17 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to applicable Law and the rules and regulations of NYSE to cause (a) the delisting of the Company Common Stock from NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. 


Section 6.18 Treatment of Company Indebtedness. 


(a) To the extent the Company has received written notice from the Parent at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing to such effect, the Company shall use, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to arrange for customary payoff letters and instruments of discharge providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all then-outstanding obligations under the Company Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness of the Company (the “Debt Payoff Letters”) to be delivered to Parent no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and shall deliver, or cause its Subsidiaries to deliver the notice of prepayment or termination thereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Credit Agreement to the holders of such Indebtedness (provided that such prepayment and termination notices may be conditional on the occurrence of the Closing). 


(b) 


(i) Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Indenture, offers to purchase, or any exchange offer, and to conduct consent solicitations, if any (each, a “Debt Offer”), with respect to any or all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 7.625% senior notes due 2027 (the “Notes”); provided that any such Debt Offer is consummated substantially simultaneously with or after the Closing using funds provided by Parent. Parent shall not be permitted to commence any applicable Debt Offer until Parent shall have provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, letter of transmittal or other related documents in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the “Debt Offer Documents”) a reasonable period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the Company and its counsel to review and comment on such Debt Offer Documents. Parent will reasonably consult with the Company regarding the timing and commencement of any Debt Offer and any tender deadlines. The closing of the Debt Offers shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Offers to close on the Closing Date; provided that the consummation of a Debt Offer shall not be a condition to Closing. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided) immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at the Effective Time of all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn and any related consent payments to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the applicable Debt Offer. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any Debt Offer; provided that nothing herein shall (x) require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (y) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to pay any fees or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with any Debt Offer or be required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with any Debt Offer or (z) require the Company or its counsel to provide any negative assurance letter with respect to any Debt Offer.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each party is entitled to contemporaneously seek both specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10 and the payment of monetary damages (including in connection with the provisions of Section 8.2(a)) as alternative remedies for a Material Breach of this Agreement by the other party, provided, however, that no party hereto shall be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance requiring consummation of the Transactions (pursuant to which the Merger actually occurs) pursuant to Section 9.10 and payment of monetary damages pursuant to Section 8.2(a), including with respect to the other party’s failure to consummate the Transactions when required pursuant to Section 1.2.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,   65

Section 2.6 Tax Consequences. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that (a) the Merger shall be treated as (i) a taxable sale by the Company of its assets to Parent in exchange for the Total Parent Consideration and (ii) the distribution of the Total Parent Consideration to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in liquidation of the Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a “plan of liquidation” of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (b) each holder of Company Common Stock will be treated as exchanging their stock in a taxable transaction for the Per Common Share Consideration, with (i) the Per Common Share Parent Consideration treated as described in clause (a)(ii) above and (ii) consistent with Article III, the Per Common Share Additional Manager Consideration paid by Parent Manager directly to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the “Intended Tax Treatment”). Each of the parties agrees to report the transactions in accordance with the Intended Tax Treatment. No party shall take any contrary position in any tax return, report or filing with any government agency or court; provided, that nothing contained herein shall prevent any party from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing authority based upon or arising out of the transactions contemplated herein, and no party shall be required to litigate before any court any such proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing authority; and, provided, further, that Manager shall be entitled to withhold under Section 1441 with respect to the Per Common Share Additional Manager Consideration.

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Cancelled Shares), shall automatically be converted into the right to receive (A) from Parent (1) that number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Per Common Share Parent Stock Consideration” and together with the Per Common Share Parent Cash Consideration, the “Per Common Share Parent Consideration”) and (2) the Per Common Share Parent Cash Consideration, and (B) from Parent Manager (acting solely on its own behalf), as additional consideration, the Per Common Share Additional Manager Consideration. As used in this Agreement, (x) “Exchange Ratio” means a quotient (rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth) determined by dividing (1) the Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share by (2) the Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share, in each case as determined in accordance with Section 3.1(c) and as such number may be adjusted in accordance with Section 3.1(d), and (y) “Per Common Share Consideration” means the sum of the Per Common Share Parent Consideration and the Per Common Share Additional Manager Consideration. 




(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i), shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Per Common Share Parent Consideration, (B) the Per Common Share Additional Manager Consideration, (C) any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(g) and (D) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), in each case, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.3. 




(iii) Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share of the Company’s 7.50% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.10 par value per share (the “Company Preferred Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive one newly issued share of Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Per Share Preferred Merger Consideration” and together with the Per Common Share Parent Consideration, the “Total Parent Consideration”). 




(iv) All such shares of Company Preferred Stock, when so converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(iii), shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each holder of a share of Company Preferred Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Preferred Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such share of Company Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 3.3. 7
















________________




(v) All shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or Buyer or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Buyer or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor (collectively, the “Cancelled Shares”). 




(c) Determination of Exchange Ratio. 




(i) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) days after the Determination Date, each Calculating Party shall prepare and deliver to the Receiving Party a Proposed Book Value Schedule, together with such supporting documentation that the Receiving Party may reasonably request. 




(ii) Within two (2) Business Days after the delivery of each Proposed Book Value Schedule, the Receiving Party shall notify the Calculating Party whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of the Proposed Book Value Schedule. In the event that the Receiving Party disputes the accuracy of the Proposed Book Value Schedule, the Receiving Party shall notify the Calculating Party in writing and in reasonable detail of those items and amounts as to which the Receiving Party disagrees and, provided the Receiving Party has received such supporting documentation reasonably necessary to do so, shall set forth the Receiving Party’s calculation of such disputed amounts (a “Dispute Notice”), and the Receiving Party shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Proposed Book Value Schedule other than as set forth in any such Dispute Notice. In the event that the Receiving Party notifies the Calculating Party that it accepts the Proposed Book Value Schedule or does not deliver a Dispute Notice to the Calculating Party during such two (2) Business Day period, the Receiving Party shall be deemed to have accepted the Proposed Book Value Schedule, and the calculations of the Parent Adjusted Book Value Per Share or Company Adjusted Book Value Per Share set forth therein shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties. 




(iii) Prior to the delivery of the Proposed Book Value Schedules, Parent and the Company shall act in good faith to mutually agree upon a nationally recognized registered independent public accounting firm or a nationally recognized independent valuation expert (in either case, the “Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm”) to resolve any disputes pursuant to this Section 3.1(c). If a Dispute Notice shall be timely delivered by the Receiving Party pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii) above, then the Calculating Party and the Receiving Party shall forthwith jointly request that the Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm make a binding determination only as to the items set forth in the Dispute Notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm will, under the terms of its engagement, be requested to render its written decision with respect to such disputed items and amounts within four (4) Business Days from the date of referral. The Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm shall consider only those items or amounts in the Proposed Book Value Schedule as to which the Receiving Party and the Calculating Party are in disagreement. The Independent 8
















________________




Accounting or Valuation Firm shall deliver to the Receiving Party and the Calculating Party a written report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Proposed Book Value Schedule based on the Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm’s determination with respect to the disputed items and amounts in accordance with this Agreement and such report shall include the calculations supporting such adjustments; provided, that for each item as to which the Calculating Party or the Receiving Party are in disagreement, the Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm shall assign a value for each such item no greater than the higher amount, and no less than the lower amount, calculated or proposed by the Calculating Party or the Receiving Party with respect to such item, as the case may be. Such report shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties, and neither party nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives will seek recourse to any courts, other tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce the determination of the Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm for purposes of this Section 3.1(c)(iii) shall be shared equally by the parties, but such fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting or Valuation Firm shall not adjust either the Company Book Value Per Share or the Parent Book Value Per Share.

Preferred Stock may vary in certain respects due to differences in the respective securities) and (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration set forth in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2. 




(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the applicable Merger Consideration, including the Per Common Share Additional Manager Consideration, pursuant to the provisions of this Article III (which shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g). No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b)(ii), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g).

(c) Termination of Rights. All Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g), in each case paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers 12
















________________




on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing Cancelled Shares), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g), without any interest thereon. 




(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the 365th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any former Company Stockholders who have not theretofore received the applicable Merger Consideration to which they are entitled under this Article III, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g), in each case without interest thereon, shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts. 




(e) No Liability. None of the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which the applicable Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 




(f) Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing Cancelled Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount, pursuant to the policies and procedures of the transfer agent for Parent, as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g). 13

(g) Distributions with Respect to Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable, with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable, that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 3.3. Following surrender of any such Certificate or Book- Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable, issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable, all whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable, to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, as applicable, were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. 




(h) No Fractional Shares of Parent Class A Common Stock. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock multiplied by (ii) (A) the average of the volume weighted average prices of one share of Company Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder), the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. 14

If Parent, the Surviving Company, Parent Manager or the Exchange Agent believes that such deduction or withholding is required, the applicable withholding Person shall provide the Company with written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to withholding any amount pursuant to this Section 3.3(i) (except that no such notice shall be required for any withholding with respect to payments of the Per Common Share Additional Manager Consideration to foreign persons) such that the Company and/or the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock, Earned Units and/or Company Dividend Equivalent Rights shall have the opportunity to eliminate or reduce such deduction or withholding obligation by filing appropriate documentation or taking other appropriate action, and subject to their respective obligations under applicable Law, Parent, the Surviving Company, Parent Manager and the Exchange Agent shall cooperate in good faith with the Company and/or such holders as necessary to eliminate or reduce such deduction or withholding. Any such amounts so deducted or withheld shall be paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company, Parent Manager or Parent, as the case may be, and such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

Section 6.3 Consents. No Consent from any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by Parent Manager in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent Manager, except for any such Consent that the failure to obtain or make would not reasonably be expected to materially prevent the ability of Parent Manager to consummate the Transactions before the End Date.

The business of Parent Manager is not currently being conducted, and at no time since December 31, 2018, has been conducted, in violation of any applicable Law, except where any such violation would not reasonably be expected to materially prevent the ability of Parent Manager to consummate the Transactions before the End Date. As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent Manager, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent Manager is pending or threatened, other than those the outcome of which would not reasonably be expected to materially prevent the ability of Parent Manager to consummate the Transactions before the End Date. 




Section 6.5 Litigation. Except for such matters as would not reasonably be expected to materially prevent the ability of Parent Manager to consummate the Transactions before the End Date, there is no (a) Proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent Manager, threatened against Parent Manager or any of its properties, rights or assets or (b) judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or order, in each case, of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent Manager. 45

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.3(d)(iii), neither Parent’s acceptance nor rejection of the Company’s offer to negotiate pursuant to this Section 7.3(d)(iii) shall have any bearing on Parent’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d); and 




(iv) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives, may seek clarification from (but not engage in negotiations with or provide non-public information to) any Person that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Company Competing Proposal (provided that the Company Competing Proposal by such Person did not result from a breach or violation of this Section 7.3), solely to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal to provide adequate information for the Company Board to make an informed determination as to whether such Company Competing Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal. 




(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, other than in response to a Company Competing Proposal (which is addressed in Section 7.3(d)(iii)), to make a Company Change of Recommendation if (i) an Intervening Event has occurred, (ii) prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law and (iii) (w) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a Notice of Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event (which notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail), (x) the Company has, and has caused its Representatives to, if requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (y) following such Notice Period, the Company Board again determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account any adjustment of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent prior to the expiration of such Notice Period) that the failure to make such Company Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that in the event the Company Board does not make a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with the preceding clause (y), but thereafter determines to make a Company Change of Recommendation pursuant to this Section 7.3 in circumstances involving or relating to another Intervening Event, the foregoing procedures referred to in this Section 7.3(e) shall apply anew. 57

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the holders of Parent Capital Stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company will promptly furnish to Parent such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the holders of Company Capital Stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Registration Statement (including the Proxy Statement) and any amendments or supplements thereto.

Each party agrees to use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such filings to be made no later than the date that is twenty-five (25) days from the date hereof. The Company and Parent shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as practicable and Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements thereto or additional information, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, (i) provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it or its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement received from the SEC and (ii) advise the other of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent will (i) provide the other with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that with respect to documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement or Registration Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, their business, financial condition or results of operations or the Transactions. 58

Each party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. 




(d) If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or the Company, should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and the parties shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by applicable Law, in disseminating such information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company Stockholders.

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of March 24, 2021, between Parent and the Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder. All information provided to any party or its Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be “Confidential Information” as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement and each party will hold, and will cause its respective Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.7, in confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 




Section 7.8 Reasonable Best Efforts. 




(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or pursuant to any contract or agreement to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing or otherwise providing, in consultation with the other party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary, subject to the limitations in this Section 7.8, to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals and (iii) executing and delivering any additional instruments reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party will have any obligation (A) to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or other disposition of any material portion of the assets or businesses of such party, any of its Subsidiaries or their Affiliates or (B) otherwise to take or commit to take any actions that would limit in any material respect the freedom of such party, its subsidiaries or their Affiliates with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses, product lines or assets; provided, further, that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take any of the actions referred to in the proceeding proviso (or agree to take such actions) without Parent’s prior written consent. 




(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall give (or shall cause their respective Affiliates to give) any required notices to third parties, and each of the parties shall use, and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to 61

use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. Each of the parties will, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required filings, notices, applications, registrations or submissions with any Governmental Entity and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the other parties of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Entity and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable and legally permitted, the parties and their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of the parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the other and each of their Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, except that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, none of the parties shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other parties the opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental Entity (except that confidential, competitively sensitive business information may be excluded from such a meeting or conversation). 




(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall pay or commit to pay to any Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person without the prior written consent of Parent. The parties shall cooperate to obtain such consents. 




Section 7.9 Employee Matters. 




(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, Parent Manager, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to employ any Person after the Closing Date, nor shall it alter the at-will employment status of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 




(b) On and after the Closing Date, Parent Manager may, in its sole discretion, offer employment to any employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any such employee who accepts employment with Parent Manager are referred to herein as “Continuing Employees.” Parent Manager may, in its sole discretion: (i) ensure that no limitations or exclusions as to pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health, waiting periods or actively-at-work exclusions or other limitations or restrictions on coverage are applicable to any Continuing Employee or their dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans sponsored by Parent Manager (“Parent Manager Plans”) in which such Continuing Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such 62
















________________




exclusions, limitations or restrictions would apply under the analogous Company Plan in which any such Continuing Employee was a participant or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) credit each Continuing Employee with their past service with the Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting under the medical, vision and dental plans of the Parent Manager Plans (except to the extent such service credit will result in duplication of benefits); and (iii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments or deductibles made during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs (in each case, only to the extent information reasonably necessary to determine and credit such amounts is either provided by or made available from the Continuing Employee, records of the Company, insurance providers or third-party administrators) for the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any Parent Manager Plan in which the Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries to employ any Person after the Effective Time. 




(c) To the extent the Company on or before the Closing Date has prepaid premiums on any of the Company’s “group health plans” (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), and to the extent the Company’s insurer accepts such premiums and has agreed to maintain coverage for the period covered by the prepayment, Parent shall not, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company not to, terminate, cancel or modify any such plans (or otherwise take any action that would result in a change of benefits provided under such plans) prior to the earlier of (x) expiration of the term covered by such prepaid premiums and (y) January 1, 2022. 




(d) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, policy or practice, including severance, vacation and paid time off plans, policies or practices, sponsored or maintained by Parent Manager or its Affiliates in which the Continuing Employees become eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent Manager may, in its sole discretion, grant, or cause to be granted to, all Continuing Employees from and after the Closing Date credit for all service with the Company, its Affiliates and their predecessors prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility to participate and accrual of vacation time, but excluding (i) eligibility to participate in any grandfathered or closed plan, defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical program and (ii) any such credit that would result in a duplication of benefits. 




(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent Manager or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 7.9 are for the sole benefit of the parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 7.9) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. 




(f) At the option of the Company or at the written request of Parent provided not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company Board shall adopt a board consent or resolutions, the form and substance of which are reasonably 63

satisfactory to Parent, to cease contributions to and terminate each plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code (the “Company 401(k) Plans”) and to 100% vest all participants under said Company 401(k) Plans, with such termination and vesting to be effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that such Company 401(k) Plan termination may be made contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 




Section 7.10 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. 




(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person (as defined below) or Person may have pursuant to the Company’s Organizational Documents or any employment agreement or any indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise (the “Indemnified Persons”) against and from all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of, or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (“Indemnified Liabilities”), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case, to the extent any such Indemnified Person is entitled to be so indemnified by the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries on the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the Company’s regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and Parent and the Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 7.10, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Company (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 7.10 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party’s position with respect to such claims). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Surviving Company shall not have any obligation hereunder to indemnify an Indemnified Person to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnified Person shall promptly refund Parent or the Surviving Company the amount of any non-indemnifiable expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto, if any. 64
















________________




(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by applicable Law. The Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause them to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors, officers or employees existing on the date of this Agreement. 




(c) The Surviving Company shall put in place, and Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, “tail” insurance policies (collectively, the “D&O Insurance”) with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of (for any one year) 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance as of the date of this Agreement; and provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to facts, acts, events or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. 




(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, or any of their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Company or such Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10. The provisions of this Section 7.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this Section 7.10, and his, her or its heirs and personal representatives. The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 7.10 are in addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under any applicable contracts or Law. Parent and the Surviving Company shall pay all expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.10. 




Section 7.11 Stockholder Litigation. In the event any Transaction Litigation is commenced, the parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. Each party shall give the other party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall consider in good faith the other party’s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation; provided, that the Company shall not agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 65

Prior to the Effective Time, each of the parties shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

If, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a Proceeding that results in judgment for such party for such amount, the defaulting party shall pay the other party its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such Proceeding. The parties agree that the monetary remedies set forth in this Section 9.3 and the specific performance remedies set forth in Section 10.11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent and any of its former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of intentional fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only Parent shall be liable for damages for such intentional fraud or Willful and Material Breach), and upon payment of such amount, neither Parent nor any of its former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for the liability of Parent in the case of intentional fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation; and (ii) Parent and Buyer against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of intentional fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only the Company shall be liable for damages for such intentional fraud or Willful and Material Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for the liability of the Company in the case of intentional fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation. 76

(f) In the event that the Company is required to pay the Company Termination Fee: 




(i) The amount payable to Parent in any tax year of Parent shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the Company Termination Fee payable to Parent, and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (“Qualifying Income”) and Parent has income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by Parent’s independent accountants, plus (2) in the event that Parent received either (x) a letter from Parent’s counsel indicating that Parent has received a ruling from the IRS as described below or (y) an opinion from Parent’s outside counsel as described below, an amount equal to the excess of the Company Termination Fee, less the amount payable under clause (A) above. 




(ii) To secure the Company’s obligation to pay the amounts described in Section 9.3(f)(i), the Company shall deposit into escrow the amount in cash equal to the Company Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by the Company on such terms (subject to this Section 9.3) as shall be mutually and reasonably agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee. The escrow agent shall provide that the Company Termination Fee in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or a combination of the following: (i) a letter from Parent’s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and Parent has income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii) a letter from Parent’s counsel indicating that (A) Parent has received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (B) Parent’s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Company Termination Fee to Parent. The Company agrees to amend this Section 9.3(f) at the reasonable request of Parent in order to (1) maximize that portion of the Company Termination Fee that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (2) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable ruling from the IRS or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in each case, as described in this Section 9.3(f)(ii). Any amount of the Company Termination Fee that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitation of this Section 9.3(f). 77

(b) No dividends on shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be authorized by the Board or paid or set apart for payment by the Company at any time when the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Company, including any agreement relating to any indebtedness of the Company, prohibit the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment thereof or provide that the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment thereof would constitute a breach of the agreement or a default under the agreement, or if the authorization, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not the Company has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of those dividends and whether or B-2

not those dividends are declared. No interest, or sum in lieu of interest, will be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series E Preferred Stock which may be in arrears, and holders of the Series E Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any dividends in excess of full cumulative dividends described in Section 4(a) hereof. Any dividend payment made on the Series E Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock. (d) Except as provided in Section 4(e) hereof, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, (i) no dividends (other than in Common Shares or in shares of any series of Preferred Shares that the Company may issue ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon Common Shares or Preferred Shares that rank junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, (ii) no other distribution shall be declared or made upon Common Shares or Preferred Shares that rank junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, and (iii) any Common Shares and Preferred Shares that rank junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation shall not be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for other capital stock of the Company that rank junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the Company of shares of any class or series of stock pursuant to the provisions of Article V of the Charter to preserve its status as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock and any Preferred Shares that rank on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation. (e) When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series E Preferred Stock and the shares of any other series of Preferred Shares that rank on a parity as to dividends with the Series E Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series E Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Shares that rank on a parity as to dividends with the Series E Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series E Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Shares that the Company may issue shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the Series E Preferred Stock and accumulated dividends per share on such other series of Preferred Shares (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such Preferred Shares do not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series E Preferred Stock which may be in arrears. (f) “Business Day” shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close.

(g) “Set apart for payment” shall be deemed to include, without any action other than the following: the recording by the Company in its accounting ledgers of any accounting or bookkeeping entry which indicates, pursuant to an authorization by the Board and a declaration of dividends or other distribution by the Company, the allocation of funds to be so paid on any series or class of shares of stock of the Company; provided, however, that if any funds for any class or series of stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends are placed in a separate account of the Company or delivered to a disbursing, paying or other similar agent, then “set apart for payment” with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock shall mean placing such funds in a separate account or delivering such funds to a disbursing, paying or other similar agent. 5. Liquidation Preference. (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid out of the assets the Company has legally available for distribution to its stockholders, subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Company ranking senior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, a liquidation preference of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to, but not including, the date of payment, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Shares or any other class or series of capital stock of the Company that it may issue that ranks junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights. (b) In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Company are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of capital stock of the Company that ranks on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and all other such classes or series of capital stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. (c) Holders of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to written notice of any such liquidation no fewer than 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to the payment date. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series E Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company. The consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other Company, trust or entity or of any other entity with or into the Company, or the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. (d) In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares of stock of the Company or otherwise, is permitted under the Maryland General Company Law, amounts that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock shall not be added to the Company’s total liabilities.

6. Redemption. (a) As provided in Article V of the Charter, the Company may purchase or redeem shares of the Series E Preferred Stock in order to preserve its qualification as a REIT. (b) Optional Redemption Right. At any time, the Company may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ written notice, redeem the Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. (c) Special Optional Redemption Right. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Company may, at its option, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ written notice, redeem the Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred, for cash at a redemption price of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. If, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined), the Company has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6, the holders of Series E Preferred Stock will not have the Change of Control Conversion Right (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the shares called for redemption. (d) A “Change of Control” is deemed to occur when the following have occurred and are continuing: (i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a “person” under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of capital stock of the Company entitling that person to exercise more than 50% of the total voting power of all capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company (except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and (ii) following the closing of any transaction referred to in clause (i), neither the Company nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common securities (or American Depositary Receipts representing such securities) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), the NYSE American Equities (the “NYSE American”) or the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), or listed or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE American or Nasdaq. (e) In the event the Company elects to redeem Series E Preferred Stock, the notice of redemption will be mailed by the Company, postage prepaid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of Series E Preferred Stock called for redemption at such holder’s address as it appears on the stock transfer records of the Company and shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series E B-5
















________________




Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates (if any) for the Series E Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on the redemption date; (vi) whether such redemption is being made pursuant to Section 6(b) or Section 6(c) hereof; (vii) if applicable, that such redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control and, in that case, a brief description of the transaction or transactions constituting such Change of Control; and (viii) if such redemption is being made in connection with a Change of Control, that the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock being so called for redemption will not be able to tender such shares of Series E Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Change of Control and that each share of Series E Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is called, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related date of redemption instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. If less than all of the Series E Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder to be redeemed. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice of redemption will be required where the Company elects to redeem Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof to preserve its REIT status. (f) Holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender the Series E Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled to the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid dividends payable upon the redemption following the surrender. (g) If notice of redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock has been given and if the Company irrevocably sets apart for payment the funds necessary for redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date (unless the Company shall default in providing for the payment of the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any), dividends will cease to accumulate on those shares of Series E Preferred Stock, those shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption. (h) If any redemption date is not a Business Day, then the redemption price and accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption may be paid on the next Business Day and no interest, additional dividends or other sums will accumulate on the amount payable for the period from and after that redemption date to that next Business Day. (i) If less than all of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares) or by any other equitable method the Company shall determine, subject to the Company’s continued qualification as a REIT.

(j) Immediately prior to any redemption of Series E Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption, unless a redemption date falls after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case each holder of Series E Preferred Stock at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided in this Section 6(j), the Company will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of the Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed. (k) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been or contemporaneously is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed, and the Company shall not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series E Preferred Stock (except by exchanging them for its capital stock ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition by the Company of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Article V of the Charter to preserve its REIT status or pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock. (l) Subject to applicable law, the Company may purchase shares of Series E Preferred Stock in the open market, by tender or by private agreement. Any shares of Series E Preferred Stock that the Company acquires may be retired and re-classified as authorized but unissued Preferred Shares, without designation as to class or series, and may thereafter be reissued as any class or series of Preferred Shares. 7. Change of Control Conversion Right. Shares of Series E Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Company, except as provided in this Section 7. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series E Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Company has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section 6 hereof, in which case such holder will have the right only with respect to shares of Series E Preferred Stock that are not called for redemption) to convert some or all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder (the “Change of Control Conversion Right”) on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common Shares (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall be shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock if more than one class of Common Shares is then outstanding) per share of Series E Preferred Stock (the “Common Shares Conversion Consideration”) equal to the lesser of: (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the sum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series E Preferred Stock plus the amount of any accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) thereon to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless B-7

the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date for the Series E Preferred Stock, in which case no additional amount for such accumulated and unpaid dividends will be included in this sum) by (y) the Common Shares Price (as defined below) (such quotient, the “Conversion Rate”); and (ii) [ ] (the “Share Cap”), subject to adjustments provided in Section 7(b) below. (b) Subsequent to the initial issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, the Share Cap shall be subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits (including those effected pursuant to a distribution of Common Shares to existing holders of Common Shares), subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a “Share Split”) with respect to Common Shares as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a Share Split will be the number of Common Shares that is equivalent to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such Share Split and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such Share Split. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Shares (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable or deliverable, as applicable, in connection with the exercise of the Change of Control Conversion Right will not exceed the product of the Share Cap times the aggregate number of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Change of Control Conversion Date (or equivalent Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the “Exchange Cap”). The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Share Splits on the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap. (c) The “Change of Control Conversion Date” is the date the Series E Preferred Stock is to be converted, which will be a Business Day selected by the Company that is neither fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which it provides the notice described in Section 7(h) to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock. (d) The “Common Shares Price” is (i) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by the holders of Common Shares is solely cash, the amount of cash consideration per Common Share or (ii) if the consideration to be received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Shares is other than solely cash (x) the average of the closing sale prices per Common Share (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and ask prices per share or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average closing bid and the average closing ask prices per share) for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which Common Shares are then traded, or (y) the average of the last quoted bid prices for Common Shares in the over-the-counter market as reported by Pink OTC Markets Inc. or similar organization for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the date on which such Change of Control occurred, if Common Shares are not then listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange.

(e) In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Shares are or will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any combination thereof) (the “Alternative Form Consideration”), a holder of Series E Preferred Stock will receive upon conversion of such shares of Series E Preferred Stock the kind and amount of Alternative Form Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number of Common Shares equal to the Common Shares Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control (the “Alternative Conversion Consideration”; the Common Shares Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion Consideration, whichever shall be applicable to a Change of Control, is referred to as the “Conversion Consideration”). (f) If the holders of Common Shares have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the Conversion Consideration in respect of such Change of Control will be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration actually received by holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares that made or voted for such an election (if electing between two types of consideration) or holders of a plurality of the outstanding Common Shares that made or voted for such an election (if electing between more than two types of consideration), as the case may be, and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Shares are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such Change of Control. (g) No fractional shares of Common Shares upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock in connection with a Change of Control will be issued. Instead, the Company will make a cash payment equal to the value of such fractional shares based upon the Common Shares Price used in determining the Common Shares Conversion Consideration for such Change of Control. (h) Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, provided that the Company has not exercised its right to redeem all shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6 hereof, the Company will provide to holders of Series E Preferred Stock a notice of occurrence of the Change of Control that describes the resulting Change of Control Conversion Right, which notice shall be delivered to the holders of record of the shares of the Series E Preferred Stock in their addresses as they appear on the stock transfer records of the Company and shall state: (i) the events constituting the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last date on which the holders of Series E Preferred Stock may exercise their Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating the Common Shares Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the Company has provided notice of its election to redeem all or any shares of Series E Preferred Stock, holders will not be able to convert the shares of Series E Preferred Stock called for redemption and such shares will be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if such shares have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per share of Series E Preferred Stock; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent, transfer agent and conversion agent for the Series E Preferred Stock; (ix) the procedures that the holders of Series E Preferred B-9
















________________




Stock must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right (including procedures for surrendering shares for conversion through the facilities of a Depositary (as defined below)), including the form of conversion notice to be delivered by such holders as described below; and (x) the last date on which holders of Series E Preferred Stock may withdraw shares surrendered for conversion and the procedures that such holders must follow to effect such a withdrawal. (i) The Company shall also issue a press release containing such notice provided for in Section 7(h) hereof for publication on the Wall Street Journal, Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or, if these organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of the press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), and post a notice on its website, in any event prior to the opening of business on the first business day following any date on which it provides the notice provided for in Section 7(h) hereof to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock. (j) To exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, the holders of Series E Preferred Stock will be required to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates (if any) representing the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted, duly endorsed for transfer (or, in the case of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a Depositary, to deliver, on or before the close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted through the facilities of such Depositary), together with a written conversion notice in the form provided by the Company, duly completed, to its transfer agent. The conversion notice must state: (i) the relevant Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iii) that the shares of Series E Preferred Stock are to be converted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Series E Preferred Stock. (k) Holders of Series E Preferred Stock may withdraw any notice of exercise of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the transfer agent of the Company prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal delivered by any holder must state: (i) the number of withdrawn shares of Series E Preferred Stock; (ii) if certificated Series E Preferred Stock has been surrendered for conversion, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn shares of Series E Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, if any, which remain subject to the holder’s conversion notice. (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 7(j) and (k) hereof, if any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or a similar depositary (each, a “Depositary”), the conversion notice and/or the notice of withdrawal, as applicable, must comply with applicable procedures, if any, of the applicable Depositary. (m) Series E Preferred Stock as to which the Change of Control Conversion Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not been properly withdrawn will be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration in accordance with the B-10

Change of Control Conversion Right on the Change of Control Conversion Date, unless prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date the Company has provided notice of its election to redeem some or all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6 hereof, in which case only the shares of Series E Preferred Stock properly surrendered for conversion and not properly withdrawn that are not called for redemption will be converted as aforesaid. If the Company elects to redeem shares of Series E Preferred Stock that would otherwise be converted into the applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date, such shares of Series E Preferred Stock will not be so converted and the holders of such shares will be entitled to receive on the applicable redemption date the redemption price as provided in Section 6 hereof. (n) The Company shall deliver all securities, cash and any other property owing upon conversion no later than the third business day following the Change of Control Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the persons entitled to receive any Common Shares or other securities delivered on conversion will be deemed to have become the holders of record thereof as of the Change of Control Conversion Date. (o) In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control Conversion Right, the Company shall comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of shares of Series E Preferred Stock into Common Shares or other property. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Series E Preferred Stock, no holder of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert such shares of Series E Preferred Stock into Common Shares to the extent that receipt of such Common Shares would cause such holder (or any other person) to exceed the applicable share transfer and ownership limitations contained in Article V of the Charter. (p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and except as otherwise required by law, the persons who are the holders of record of shares of Series E Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of those shares after such Dividend Record Date and on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date and, in such case, the full amount of such dividend shall be paid on such Dividend Payment Date to the persons who were the holders of record at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date. Except as provided in this Section 7(p), the Company will make no allowance for unpaid dividends that are not in arrears on the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be converted. 8. Limited Voting Rights. (a) Holders of the Series E Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, except as set forth in this Section 8. On each matter on which holders of Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, each share of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote, except that when shares of any other class or series of the Preferred Shares have the right to vote with the Series E Preferred Stock as a single class on any matter, the Series E Preferred Stock and the shares of each such other class or series will have one vote for each $25.00 of liquidation preference (excluding accumulated dividends). (b) Whenever dividends on any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors B-11

constituting the Board will be automatically increased by two (if not already increased by two by reason of the election of directors by the holders of any other class or series of Preferred Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and with which the Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to vote as a class with respect to the election of those two directors) and the holders of Series E Preferred Stock, voting as a single class with all other classes or series of Preferred Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series E Preferred Stock in the election of those two directors, will be entitled to vote for the election of those two additional directors at a special meeting called by the Company at the request of the holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock or by the holders of any other class or series of Preferred Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series E Preferred Stock in the election of those two directors (unless the request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company, in which case, such vote will be held at the earlier of the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company), and at each subsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated on the Series E Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment. In that case, the right of holders of the Series E Preferred Stock to elect any directors will cease and, unless there are other classes or series of Preferred Shares upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, the term of office of any directors elected by holders of the Series E Preferred Stock shall immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board shall be reduced accordingly. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the total number of directors elected by holders of the Series E Preferred Stock (voting as a single class with all other classes or series of Preferred Shares that the Company may issue and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series E Preferred Stock in the election of such directors) pursuant to the voting rights under this Section 8 exceed two. (c) If a special meeting at a place within the United States designated by the Company is not called by the Company within 30 days after request from the holders of Series E Preferred Stock as described in Section 8(b) hereof, then the holders of record of at least 25% of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock may designate a holder to call the meeting at the expense of the Company and such meeting may be called by the holder so designated upon notice similar to that required for annual meetings of stockholders and shall be held at the place within the United States designated by the holder calling such meeting. The Company shall pay all costs and expenses of calling and holding any meeting and of electing directors pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, including, without limitation, the cost of preparing, reproducing and mailing the notice of such meeting, the cost of renting a room for such meeting to be held, and the cost of collecting and tabulating votes. (d) If, at any time when the voting rights conferred upon the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof are exercisable, any vacancy in the office of a director elected pursuant to Section 8(b) shall occur, then such vacancy may be filled only by the remaining such director or by vote of the holders of record of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock B-12

(f) The voting rights provided for in this Section 8 will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which voting by holders of the Series E Preferred Stock would otherwise be required pursuant to this Section 8 shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption pursuant to Section 6 hereof.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of any series of Preferred Shares ranking on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote together as a class with the holders of Series E Preferred Stock on any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Charter unless such action affects the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Shares equally. 9. Information Rights. During any period in which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company will use its best efforts to (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible means under the Exchange Act) to all holders of Series E Preferred Stock, as their names and addresses appear on the record books of the Company and without cost to such holders, copies of the annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, respectively, that the Company would have been required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if it were subject thereto (other than any exhibits that would have been required); and (ii) promptly, upon request, supply copies of such reports to any holders or prospective holder of Series E Preferred Stock. The Company will use its best efforts to mail (or otherwise provide) the information to the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, in respect of such information would have been required to be filed with the SEC, if the Company were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case, based on the dates on which the Company would be required to file such periodic reports if it were a “non-accelerated filer” within the meaning of the Exchange Act. 10.

ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY 


SERIES F CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 


FRANKLIN BSP REALTY TRUST, INC., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the “SDAT”) that: 


FIRST: The charter of the Company (the “Charter”) authorizes the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Preferred Shares”), issuable from time to time in one or more series, and authorizes the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) to classify or reclassify any unissued shares from time to time by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or distributions, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption of such unissued shares. 


SECOND: Under the authority contained in the Charter, the Board, in resolutions adopted at a meeting held on October [ ], 2021, has reclassified 50,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common Shares”), into additional Preferred Shares, without designation as to class or series. As a result, the Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 Preferred Shares and 900,000,000 Common Shares. 


THIRD: Under the authority contained in the Charter, the Board, in resolutions adopted at a meeting held on October [ ], 2021, has classified and designated 40,000,000 Preferred Shares of the Company as Series F Convertible Preferred Stock, with the following preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or distributions, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption, which upon any restatement of the Charter, shall be deemed to be part of Article V of the Charter, with any necessary or appropriate changes to the enumeration of sections or subsections hereof. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Charter. 


Series F Convertible Preferred Stock 


(1) Designation and Number. A series of Preferred Shares, designated as the “Series F Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Series F Preferred Shares”), is hereby established. The par value of the Series F Preferred Shares is $0.01 per share. The number of authorized Series F Preferred Shares is 40,000,000. 


(2) Maturity. The Series F Preferred Shares have no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption. 


(3) Ranking. The Series F Preferred Shares will, with respect to rights to receive dividends and to participate in distributions or payments upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (a “Liquidation Event”), rank (a) senior to shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common Shares”) and any other class or series of equity securities (the “Equity Securities”), now or hereafter issued and outstanding, the terms of which provide that such Equity Securities rank, as to dividend payments and the distribution of assets upon a Liquidation Event, junior to such Series F Preferred Shares (“Junior Equity Securities”), and (b) junior to the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share and any other Equity Securities now or hereafter issued by the Company and outstanding with terms specifically providing that such Equity Securities rank senior to the Series F Preferred Shares with respect to rights of dividend payments and the distribution of assets upon a Liquidation Event (“Senior Equity Securities”). 


(4) Dividends. 


(a) Dividends on each outstanding Series F Preferred Share shall be payable, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore, on the date the Company pays a dividend on its Common Shares (each such day being hereinafter called a “Series F Dividend Payment Date”) at the then applicable Dividend Rate (as defined below). Each dividend is payable to holders of record as they appear on the share records of the Company at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the record date for each such dividend payment, which shall be the record date for the Common Shares with respect to such dividend payment (each such date, a “Record Date”). 


(b) Dividends payable on each Series F Preferred Share on the Series F Dividend Payment Date shall be equal to the dividend paid with respect to a Common Share on such date (the “Dividend Rate”). Dividends shall be paid in the form in which dividends were paid to holders of Common Shares.








________________


(c) If, for any taxable year, the Company elects to designate as a “capital gain dividend” (as defined in Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) any portion (the “Capital Gains Amount”) of the dividends (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of the Company’s equity securities (the “Total Dividends”), then, except as otherwise required by applicable law, that portion of the Capital Gains Amount that shall be allocable to the holders of Series F Preferred Shares shall be in proportion to the amount that the total dividends (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) paid or made available to the holders of the Series F Preferred Shares for the year bears to the Total Dividends. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Company will make a similar allocation with respect to any undistributed long-term capital gains of the Company which are to be included in its stockholders’ long-term capital gains, based on the allocation of the Capital Gains Amount which would have resulted if such undistributed long-term capital gains had been distributed as “capital gains dividends” by the Company to its stockholders. 


(d) As used herein, the term “Business Day” shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. 


(5) Liquidation Preference. 


(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Equity Securities, a holder of Series F Preferred Shares shall receive an amount per share equal to $2.00 per share. 


(b) Upon any Liquidation Event, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Series F Preferred Shares, as provided in paragraph 5(a) above, any series or class or classes of Junior Equity Securities shall, subject to any respective terms and provisions applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the Series F Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to share therein. 


(c) Notice of any Liquidation Event, stating the payment or conversion date or dates when, and the place or places where the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable or converted, shall be given not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series F Preferred Shares at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the share transfer records of the Company. 


(d) In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of shares of stock of the Company or otherwise, is permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, amounts that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders of shares of the Series F Preferred Stock shall not be added to the Company’s total liabilities. 


(6) Redemption. The Series F Preferred Shares are not redeemable. 


(7) Conversion. The Series F Preferred Shares are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of Company, except as provided in this paragraph (7). 


(a) Mandatory Conversion. Each Series F Preferred Share (or fractional share) shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof convert into one Common Share (or equivalent fractional share, as applicable) (subject to adjustment as contemplated in Section 7(c) below, the “Conversion Rate”) upon the earlier of (i) the six-month anniversary of the listing of the Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange, (ii) the date approved as the conversion date by the Board following a termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 25, 2021, by and among the Company, Rodeo Sub I, LLC, Capstead Mortgage Corporation and Benefit Street Partners L.L.C., (iii) three business days prior to a Liquidation Event in the event that the Board determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that the liquidating distribution per share in respect of such converted Series F Preferred Share (or fractional share) would be in an amount in excess of $2.00 per share, or (iv) immediately prior to the effective time of a Company Change of Control, provided that the consideration per share payable in connection with such Company Change of Control in respect of such converted Series F Preferred Share (or fractional share) is an amount in excess of $2.00. A “Company Change of Control” shall be deemed to have occurred at such time after the effective date of these Articles Supplementary when the following has occurred and is continuing: the sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company (by sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise), or the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a “person” under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of securities of the Company entitling the acquiring person to exercise more








________________


than fifty percent (50%) of the total economic interests or total voting power of all securities of beneficial interest of the Company entitled to vote generally (except that such acquiring person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition). 


(b) Miscellaneous. 


(i) Any conversion pursuant to this Section 7 shall be subject to and effected in compliance with all U.S. federal and state laws and applicable stock exchange rules. 


(ii) The Company will issue all Common Shares or other securities issuable upon conversion in uncertificated book entry-form no later than the fourth Business Day following the conversion date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the persons entitled to receive any Common Shares or other securities upon conversion will be deemed to have become the holders of record thereof as of the conversion date. 


(iii) The Company will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Shares, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series F Preferred Shares as provided herein, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of Common Shares as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series F Preferred Shares then outstanding. 


(c) Anti-Dilution. 


(i) If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time after the effective date of these Articles Supplementary while any Series F Preferred Shares are outstanding, subdivide, combine, reclassify, or split its outstanding Common Shares into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate by a fraction: 


(A) the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective; and 


(B) the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the day that such subdivision, combination, reclassification or split becomes effective. 


An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(c)(i) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, reclassification, split or combination becomes effective. 


(8) Voting Rights. 


(a) So long as Series F Preferred Shares are outstanding, the affirmative vote of holders entitled to cast two-thirds (2/3) of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding Series F Preferred Shares shall be necessary to approve any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provisions of the Company’s Charter, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege, voting power, conversion right, qualification and terms and conditions of redemption of the Series F Preferred Shares, provided, however, that the classification or issuance of any shares of any class or series of Equity Securities, including without limitation Senior Equity Securities, shall not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the Series F Preferred Shares. In any matter in which the holders of Series F Preferred Shares are entitled to vote, each such holder shall have the right to one vote for each Series F Preferred Share held by such holder. 


(b) Each Series F Preferred Share shall entitle the holder thereof on the applicable record date to vote together with the holders of Common Shares as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of Common Shares, whether at a meeting of stockholders or by written consent. Each Series F Preferred Share will be entitled to a number of votes equal to the Conversion Rate (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Common Shares). The holders of Series F Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of all annual or special meetings of the stockholders of the Company in the same manner in which the holders of Common Shares are entitled to such notice. 


(9) Other Limitations; Ownership and Transfer. The Series F Preferred Shares constitute Preferred Shares of the Company and are governed by and issued subject to all the limitations, terms and conditions of the Charter applicable to Preferred Shares generally, including but not limited to the terms and conditions (including exceptions and exemptions) of Article V of the Charter applicable to Preferred Shares. The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to limit the applicability to the Series F Preferred Shares of any other term or provision of the Charter.








________________


(10) Record Holders. The Company and the transfer agent for the Series F Preferred Shares may deem and treat the record holder of any Series F Preferred Shares as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Company nor the transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 


(11) Miscellaneous. 


(a) Preemptive and Appraisal Rights. The Series F Preferred Shares are subject to Section 5.12 of the Charter. 


(b) Tax Withholding. The Company may withhold from or pay on behalf of or with respect to each holder of Series F Preferred Shares any amount of U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign taxes that the Company reasonably determines that it was or is required to withhold or pay with respect to any cash or property distributable, allocable or otherwise transferred to such holder pursuant to these Articles Supplementary, including, without limitation, any taxes required to be withheld or paid by the Company pursuant to Section 1441, 1442, or 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 


(c) Status of Reacquired or Converted Series F Preferred Shares. Any Series F Preferred Shares that shall at any time have been repurchased, redeemed, reacquired or converted shall, after such repurchase, redemption, reacquisition or conversion, have the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Shares, without designation as to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a particular series by the Board. 


(d) Severability. If any term of the Series F Preferred Shares is invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or public policy, then, to the extent permitted by law, all other terms of the Series F Preferred Shares which can be given effect without the invalid, unlawful or unenforceable term shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be deemed dependent upon any other such term unless so expressed herein. 


(e) Terms of the Series F Preferred Shares. All references to the “terms” of the Series F Preferred Shares (and all similar references) shall include all of the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions and limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and other terms and provisions set forth in paragraphs (1) through (10), inclusive, hereof.

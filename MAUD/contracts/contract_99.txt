ARTICLE 1 THE OFFER 


1.1 The Offer. 


(a) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to Article 8, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price per Company Share, subject to the terms of Section 1.1(c), equal to the Offer Price, without interest. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the “Offer to Purchase”) that is disseminated to all of the Company Stockholders as and to the extent required by United States federal securities laws and contains the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in Annex A. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and thereof. The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably accept for payment and pay for any Company Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to: 


(i) the condition (the “Minimum Condition”) that, as of immediately prior to the Expiration Time, there be validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer, and “received” by the “depository” for the Offer (as such terms are defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL), a number of Company Shares that, together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates (excluding shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been “received”, as defined by Section 251(h) of the DGCL), represents at least a majority of all then outstanding Company Shares as of the Expiration Time; and 


(ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex A (as they may be amended in accordance with this Agreement). 


(b) Waiver of Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right (but are not obligated to) at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion to waive, in whole or in part, any of the conditions to the Offer, to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement or to increase the Offer Price; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub may not (and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to) (i) waive or modify the Minimum Condition or the Termination Condition, or (ii) make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (B) decreases the Offer Price or the number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer or the Expiration Time, except as required or permitted by Section 1.1(d), (D) imposes conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in Annex A, or (E) amends any term or condition of the Offer in any manner that is adverse to the Company Stockholders. 


(c) Adjustments to the Offer Price. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the -3-








________________


Acceptance Time, any change in the outstanding Equity Interests of the Company shall occur as a result of any reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Shares) with a record date during such period, the Offer Price will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and provide the holders of each Company Share the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing in this Section 1.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any such action without the consent of Parent if required under Section 6.1. 


(d) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. 


(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the Offer shall initially expire at 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the twentieth (20t h) Business Day following (and including the day of) the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14(d)-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (as such date and time may be extended, the “Expiration Time”), unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. In the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so extended. 


(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.1(d)(i) or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms: 


(A) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any Law or Order, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or the NYSE (including in order to comply with Exchange Act Rule 14e-1(b) in respect of any change in the Offer Price) or as may be necessary to resolve any comments of the SEC or the staff or NYSE, in each case, as applicable to the Offer, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Offer Documents; 


(B) if, as of any then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A are not satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for one or more successive extension periods of five (5) Business Days each (with each such period to end at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the last Business Day of such period) (or any other period as may be approved in advance by the Company) in order to permit the satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Offer; provided, however, that if the sole then-unsatisfied condition to the Offer is the Minimum Condition, Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer for more than three (3) occasions in consecutive periods of five (5) Business Days each (each such period to end at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the last Business Day of such period) (or such other period as may be approved in advance by the parties); or 


(C) if, at the then-scheduled expiration time of the Offer, the Company brings or shall have brought any action in accordance with Section 9.16 to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by Parent or -4-

(D) if, as of any then-scheduled Expiration Time, (A)(1) the full amount of the Debt Financing (other than with respect to any revolving credit facility thereunder) has not been funded and will not be available to be funded at the consummation of the Offer and/or the Closing, and (2) the Consent Solicitation Triggering Event shall not have occurred and (B) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree in writing that (1) the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to, and only in accordance with and upon the satisfaction of the requirements set forth in, Section 8.1(i) and receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to, and only in accordance with and upon the satisfaction of the requirements set forth in, Section 8.3(c) and (2) solely with respect to both (x) any payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with subclause (1) of this Section 1.1(d)(ii)(C) and (y) Merger Sub’s obligation, and Parent’s obligation to cause Merger Sub, to consummate the Offer, including to accept and thereafter pay for all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and in accordance with this Section 1.1, all conditions to the Offer set forth (I) in clause (B)(2)(iii) and (B)(4) of Annex A and (II) other than in respect of any willful or material breach (including any Willful Breach) following the date of delivery of such notice, in clause (B)(3) of Annex A will be deemed to have been satisfied or waived at the Expiration Time after giving effect to any extension pursuant to this Section 1.1(d)(ii)(C) and, for the avoidance of doubt, only at such time, Merger Sub shall have the right in its sole discretion to extend the Offer on up to three occasions in consecutive periods of five (5) Business Days each (each such period to end at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of such period) (or such other duration as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company); provided, that Merger Sub shall not be permitted to extend the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date (for the avoidance of doubt, as the Outside Date may be extended pursuant to Section 8.1(b)); 


provided, however, that the foregoing clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this Section 1.1(d)(ii) shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Article 8. 


(iii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall extend the Offer in any manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.1(d)(ii) without the prior written consent of the Company. 


(iv) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article 8, in which case Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one (1) Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement. 


(v) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. -5-

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, including the satisfaction of all conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), at or as promptly as practicable following the Expiration Time (as it may be extended in accordance with Section 1.1(d)(ii)), but in any event within one (1) Business Day thereof, irrevocably accept for payment, and, at or as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time, but in any event within three (3) Business Days thereof, pay for, all Company Shares that are validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer; provided that with respect to Company Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee, Merger Sub shall be under no obligation to make any payment for such Company Shares unless and until such Company Shares are delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds that are necessary to pay for any and all Company Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, accept for payment or pay for any Company Shares if, as a result, Merger Sub would acquire less than the number of Company Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid without interest, net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.5, applicable Law and the terms and conditions of the Offer.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a Subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). The Merger shall be governed by and effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, as provided under the DGCL.

The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time (but in any event no later than the Business Day immediately following the Acceptance Time), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver (if permitted by applicable Law) of those conditions at the Closing) (the “Closing Date”), by electronic exchange of documents, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable on the Closing Date, or such other date and time to which Merger Sub and the Company may agree in writing, the Company shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and the Company and Merger Sub shall make all other filings required under the DGCL in connection with the consummation of the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”).

ARTICLE 3 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

(a) Conversion of Company Shares. Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (A) any Dissenting Shares and (B) any Cancelled Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price (the “Merger Consideration”), without interest and less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to Section 3.5. From and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon surrender of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares in accordance with Section 3.2 or Section 3.4. 


(b) Merger Sub Equity Interests. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 


(c) Cancelled Shares. Each Company Share that is owned directly by the Company (or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company), Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cancelled Shares”) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement. 


3.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates. 


(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a reputable U.S. bank or trust company to act as depositary agent for the Company Stockholders entitled to receive the Offer Price pursuant to Section 1.1(e) and as the paying agent -11-

for the Company Stockholders entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Company) (the “Paying Agent”). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or promptly after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount equal to (i) the aggregate consideration to which the Company Stockholders are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.1(e) and (ii) the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (such cash amounts, collectively, the “Exchange Fund”) for the sole benefit of the holders of Company Shares. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make delivery of the Offer Price and Merger Consideration, as applicable, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to pay the aggregate amounts contemplated by Section 1.1(e) and Section 3.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional cash in immediately available funds, as applicable, with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Company Shares; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Shares. 


(b) Procedures for Surrender. 


(i) Payment of Offer Price. Following the Acceptance Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the Company Stockholders that are entitled to receive the Offer Price pursuant to Section 1.1(e) such amount in respect thereof in accordance with the terms of Section 1.1(e) and in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 


(ii) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares represented by certificates (the “Certificates”), which Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in a customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall have a customary release of all claims against Parent, Merger Sub and the Company arising out of or related to such holder’s ownership of Company Shares and shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree upon (a “Letter of Transmittal”) and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the -12-








________________


Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 3.2(e)) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed in writing by Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.5), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any Transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates representing any Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, or any Cancelled Shares. 


(iii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall upon the Effective Time, in accordance with The Depository Trust Company’s customary procedures (including receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” (or such other evidence of transfer or surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request)) and such other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent and The Depository Trust Company, be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, for the benefit of the holder of such Book-Entry Shares held through it, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration for each such Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.5) and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company (A) a Letter of Transmittal and (B) instructions for returning such Letter of Transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon delivery of such Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of -13-








________________


such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, for each such Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.5), and such Book- Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, or Cancelled Shares. 


(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further recording or registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2, or Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, or Cancelled Shares. The Merger Consideration paid to such Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares, except for Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the Effective Time, Certificates or any other valid evidence of ownership of Company Shares that have not previously been surrendered are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. 


(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.2(b) prior to such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger Consideration, in each case without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, in respect of such holder’s surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 3.2(b). Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the -14-








________________


Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 


(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit, in customary form, reasonably acceptable to Parent (which shall contain an agreement in customary form to indemnify Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificates) of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1(a), without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. In addition, Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration require the owner(s) of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a customary and reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 


3.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but subject to the provisions of this Section 3.3), Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Shares, the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and shall be exchangeable for, subject to compliance with the procedures in Section 3.2(b), solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes pursuant to Section 3.5 and as required by applicable Law. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand; and (ii) the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not pay or settle, or make any payment or settlement offer, prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument or agree to do any of the foregoing unless Parent shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement, or payment or settlement offer. -15-

3.4 Treatment of Company Equity Awards. 


(a) Company Stock Options. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof, be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) an amount equal to (A) the Merger Consideration, less (B) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option (the “Option Consideration”); provided, however, that any Company Stock Option with respect to which the applicable per share exercise price is greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled without consideration therefor. Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each holder of a Company Stock Option, the applicable Option Consideration with respect to such Company Stock Option (less any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 3.5) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date) after the Effective Time. 


(b) Company RSU Awards. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the holder thereof, be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Merger Consideration (the “RSU Consideration”). Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each holder of a Company RSU Award who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was a non-employee director of the Company the applicable RSU Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 3.5) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date) after the Effective Time (or, if applicable, the applicable Deferred Settlement Date). With respect to each Company RSU Award that as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was held by an individual who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was not a non-employee director of the Company, as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date) after the earlier of (i) the nine-month anniversary of the Effective Time and (ii) the date on which such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) was scheduled to vest in accordance with its terms as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such earlier date, the “RSU Vesting Date”), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holder of such Company RSU Award, the applicable RSU Consideration with respect to such Company RSU Award or portion thereof (less any applicable withholding Taxes), subject to such holder’s continued employment with the Surviving Corporation (or Parent or its Subsidiaries) through the applicable RSU Vesting Date; provided that, if such holder’s employment terminates prior to the applicable RSU Vesting Date due to termination by the Surviving Corporation (or Parent or its Subsidiaries) without Cause, by such holder for Good Reason, or due to the holder’s death or Disability, then subject to such holder’s (or estate’s) execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form provided by the Surviving -16-

Corporation (a “Release”), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to such holder the applicable RSU Consideration with respect to such Company RSU Award (less any applicable withholding Taxes) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date) after the effective date of such Release (or, if applicable, the applicable Deferred Settlement Date). Any payment in respect of any Company RSU Award that, immediately prior to such cancellation, was treated as “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Company RSU Awards if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code (the “Deferred Settlement Date”). 


3.5 Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Tax Law; provided, however, that, except (i) with respect to amounts treated as compensation for Tax purposes or (ii) as a result of the failure of any holder of Company Shares to provide Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or W-8, as applicable, demonstrating that such holder is exempt from withholding, Parent shall provide the Company commercially reasonable notice of any applicable payor’s intention to make such deduction or withholding and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to obtain such reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 


3.6 Further Actions. As of the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of the waiver or release of any standstill by the Company, including disclosure of the identities of the parties thereto and a summary of the material circumstances relating thereto.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and for calculating severance and vacation entitlements under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries (each, a “New Plan”), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent that coverage under such New Plans is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”) and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all eligibility waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the -56-

Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, to the extent a Company Performance Award vests in accordance with the preceding sentence, any payment in respect of any Company Performance Award that, immediately prior to such cancellation, was treated as “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Company Performance Award if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 


(e) Section 6.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof, for each Company Employee who participates in the 2021 Executive Bonus Program, such employee’s name and target and maximum bonus opportunities.

Such annual bonuses (less any applicable withholding Taxes) shall be paid no later than January 31, 2022, subject to the Company Employee’s continued employment through December 31, 2021; provided, however, if any such Company Employee’s employment is terminated by the Surviving Corporation (or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) without “cause” or for “good reason” (in each case, within the meaning -57-

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing in an amount required to satisfy the Required Amount not later than the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing Letters (including complying with any valid request requiring the exercise of “market flex” provisions in the fee letter associated with the Debt Commitment Letters) (or on other terms with respect to conditionality that are not less favorable to Parent than the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters and otherwise on terms and conditions as would not have any result, event or consequence described in any of clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.15(c), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the Financing Letters and the Limited Guarantee, (ii) negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) (which, with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing)) on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (which may reflect “market flex” provisions) (or on other terms with respect to conditionality that are not less favorable to Parent than the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters and otherwise on terms and conditions as would not have any result, event or consequence described in any of clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.15(c)) (such definitive agreements, the “Definitive Financing Agreements”), (iii) satisfy and comply with on a timely basis (except to the extent that Parent and Merger Sub have obtained the waiver of) all conditions and covenants to the funding or investing of the Financing required to pay the Required Amount applicable to Parent or Merger Sub in the Financing Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements that are within their control that are to be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) consummate the Financing in an amount required to pay the Required Amount or enforce the Limited Guarantee at or prior to the Closing and (v) enforce its rights under the Financing Letters and the Limited Guarantee. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall release or consent to the termination of the obligations of any Investor to provide the Equity Financing in an amount required to pay the Required Amount or to the termination of obligations under the Limited Guarantee. 


(b) In the event that, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under Section 6.15(c), any portion of the Debt Financing in an amount required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any “market flex” provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, notify the Company of such unavailability and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing on terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions (including any “market flex” provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letters in -68-

In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt Financing in an amount required to pay the Required Amount (after taking into account any available Equity Financing) becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but any bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 6.15(b)) are available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, then Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall any Alternative Financing Commitment Letter, or any amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, modification or supplement to, or replacement of, the Debt Commitment Letters, be deemed to adversely expand the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to assist with respect to the Debt Financing under Section 6.14. 


(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.15 will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letters.

Without limitation of the foregoing, upon the request of the Company from time to time, Parent will promptly update the Company on the material activity and developments of its efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing, including by providing copies of all definitive agreements (and drafts of all offering documents and marketing materials) related to the Financing, and any amendments, modifications or replacements to any Financing Letters (or any Alternative Financing Commitment Letter).

(b) The parties agree that (i) if this Agreement is validly terminated by (A) either Parent or the Company in accordance with Section 8.1(b) or (B) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f); and, prior to the date of such termination, a Company Acquisition Proposal is made public by the Company or any other Person or otherwise becomes publicly known, and (ii) within twelve (12) months after such termination (A) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) the transactions contemplated by any Company Acquisition Proposal are consummated (which need not be the same Company Acquisition Proposal that was made public or publicly known prior to the termination of this Agreement), then the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) the Company Termination Fee to Parent (or its designee), by wire transfer of same-day funds no later than two (2) Business Days after the consummation of such transaction. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b), the term “Company Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.6, except that the references to “20% or more” shall be deemed to be references to “more than 50%.” In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events. 


(c) The parties agree that if this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to (x) Section 8.1(i) or (y) Section 8.1(b) under circumstances in which the Company would have been entitled to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i), Parent shall pay to the Company, within two (2) Business Days following such termination, the Parent Termination Fee, it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Parent Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events. 


(d) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without this Section 8.3, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement, and that each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a), Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c), as applicable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

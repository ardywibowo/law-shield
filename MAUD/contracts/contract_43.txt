AGREEMENT 


The parties to this Agreement (each a “Party” and collectively the “Parties”) agree as follows: 


SECTION 1 


THE OFFER 


1.1 The Offer. (a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than five business days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to Sections 1.1(e) and 1.2(b)), Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(i) or converted pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(ii) (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”)), at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest, and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section 2.6(e). (b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the “Offer Conditions”). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the “Offer to Purchase”) that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in clause (e) or (g) of Annex I, (F) otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects, or reasonably could adversely affect, any holder of Shares in its capacity as such, (G) terminate the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date, in each case, except as provided in Section 1.1(c) or 1.1(d) or (H) provide any “subsequent offering period” (or any extension thereof) within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.   2








________________


(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date that is twenty business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) from the Offer Commencement Date (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the “Initial Expiration Date”, and such date or such subsequent date to which the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the “Expiration Date”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties’ respective termination rights under Section 8: (i) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by Purchaser or Parent, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to ten business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to ten business days per extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated shall have been obtained; and (iii) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by Purchaser or Parent, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8 and (y) the End Date (such earlier occurrence, the “Extension Deadline”); or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company. Subject to the parties’ respective termination rights under Section 8, Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer, or permit the Offer to expire, prior to the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company. (d) Termination of Offer. Nothing in this Section 1.1 shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company, Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8, Purchaser shall immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall immediately return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. (e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the “Offer Documents”) that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer   3








________________


Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC (A) to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements and (B) to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. The Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parent’s legal counsel all information concerning the Company and the Company’s stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments). (f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11, Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the funds necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and Purchaser shall perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchaser’s obligations under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer. (g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted. (h) Acceptance. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (i) promptly after the Expiration Date accept for payment all Shares tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the “Offer Acceptance Time”) and (ii) promptly after the Offer Acceptance Time pay for such Shares.   4

(i) Transfer Taxes. If the payment of the Offer Price is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the tendered Shares are registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Offer Price to a Person other than the registered holder of the Shares tendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Purchaser that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this Section 1.1(i) under any circumstance. 


1.2 Company Actions. (a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, following the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the “Schedule 14D-9”) that, subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and include the notice and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record date for purposes of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 (x) to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company or the Company’s legal counsel all information concerning Parent or Purchaser that may be required in connection or reasonably requested with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2(a). Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments).   5

(b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer and the Merger (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, which date shall not be more than ten business days prior to the date the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the “Stockholder List Date”). Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request by the Company, deliver, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or control, and, if requested by the Company, promptly certify to the Company in writing that all such material has been returned or destroyed. (c) Share Registry. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Purchaser effective immediately after the Offer Acceptance Time.

Time except if the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permissible by applicable Legal Requirements, waived as of such date, in which case on the first business day on which all conditions set forth in Section 7.1 are satisfied or, to the extent permissible by applicable Legal Requirements, waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date”. (b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company and Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect to the Merger, in such form as required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and the Parties shall take all such further actions as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements to make the Merger effective. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of that certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed upon in writing by the Parties and specified in the certificate of merger (such date and time, the “Effective Time”). 


2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. (a) As of the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall by virtue of the Merger and without any further action, be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth on Annex II and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 6.5(a). (b) As of the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to the bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 6.5(a), except that references to the name of Purchaser shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Corporation. (c) As of the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the respective individuals who served as the directors and officers of Purchaser as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 


2.5 Conversion of Shares. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: (i) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company (or held in the Company’s treasury) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;   7








________________


(ii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall be converted into such number of shares of the Surviving Corporation such that immediately following the Merger such holders hold the same percentage of interest in the Surviving Corporation as they owned in the Company immediately prior to the Merger; (iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to Section 2.5(b), each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Dissenting Shares, which shall have only those rights set forth in Section 2.7) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the “Merger Consideration”), in each case without any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section 2.6(e); and (iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Purchaser then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 


From and after the Effective Time, subject to this Section 2.5(a), all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of Taxes therefor, upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.6. (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted. 


2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books. (a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Depository Agent”) for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Offer Price to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Promptly after the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant to Section 1.1(h). On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iii) (together with the amount deposited pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer Price in the Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; provided that such investments shall be (w) in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, (x) in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, (y) in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or (z) in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months.   8

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of (i) Shares represented by a certificate evidencing such Shares (the “Certificates”) or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who, in each case was entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, (A) a form of letter of transmittal, which shall be in reasonable and customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.6(f), if applicable) to the Paying Agent, or a customary agent’s message with respect to Book-Entry Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to Section 2.5. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.6(f), if applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal in the case of Certificates, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book- Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this Section 2.6(b) under any circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.5. (c) At any time following twelve months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (with respect to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5) which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to   9

the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. (e) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser, and their Affiliates, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent or the Depository Agent to deduct and withhold) from any amount payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such withholding agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate any such withholding, including by requesting any necessary Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information. Each such withholding agent shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder, claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2.   10

2.7 Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”), shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be automatically cancelled and no longer outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder’s Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), and such Shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and Purchaser, settle or offer to settle, or make any payment with respect to, any such demands, or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing. 


2.8 Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, in its discretion, accelerate the exercisability of any Company Option. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per Share with respect to such Company Option, multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (without regard to vesting). For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Option with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled without any consideration to the holder thereof. (b) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is then outstanding shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (without regard to vesting). (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but, subject to Section 2.8(e), no later than ten business days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, pay the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to Sections 2.8(a) and 2.8(b), net of any applicable withholding Taxes, to the holders of Company Options and Company RSUs.   11

(e) To the extent a payment pursuant to this Section 2.8 would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty. 2.9 Further Action. The Parties agree to take all necessary action to cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with this Section 2 as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer without a meeting of the Company’s stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than five business days after the date hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Parties, make an appropriate filing of all notification and report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and (ii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, but in no event later than five business days after the date hereof, any other filings, notifications or other consents are required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions. Each Party agrees not to withdraw their filing under the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other Party, and each Party agrees not to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority to delay, or otherwise not to consummate as soon as practicable, any of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior written consent of the other Party.   42

6.3 Employee Benefits. (a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one-year period (each, a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that provided to such Continuing Employee by the any Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) annual cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits (other than equity compensation and other long-term incentives, change in control, retention, transition, stay or similar arrangements) that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the compensation and employee benefits (other than equity compensation and other long-term incentives, change in control, retention, transition, stay or similar arrangements) provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation   43

immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause each Continuing Employee (other than Continuing Employees who have contractual severance protection from the Company and its Subsidiaries) to participate in the severance program of Parent applicable to United States employees (such program, as in effect on the date hereof, as made available to the Company on or prior to the date hereof) and shall cause such Continuing Employees to be credited with their years of service with the Company or a Subsidiary for purposes of determining the amount of severance payments and benefits thereunder; provided that the minimum weeks of severance payable to an eligible Continuing Employee under such severance program shall be 13 weeks, notwithstanding any provision of the program to the contrary. (b) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility or vesting under any benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation (each such plan, a “Parent Plan”), then, following the Effective Time, Parent shall ensure that such Parent Plan shall, for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, credit Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its Affiliates or their respective predecessors to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding benefit plan of the Company. In addition, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall credit each Continuing Employee with paid time off equal to the paid time off the Continuing Employee had accrued, but had not used, with the Company as of the Effective Time. For purposes of determining the amount of paid time off only, to the extent that service is relevant for paid time off levels, Parent shall ensure that any paid time off plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall, for purposes of paid time off levels, credit Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time. (c) Following the Effective Time, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent shall (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or an Affiliate that provides health benefits in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding Employee Plan, (ii) for the calendar year in which the effective time occurs, honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to transitioning into a plan of Parent or an Affiliate during the portion of such calendar year prior to such transition in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding health plans of Parent or an Affiliate and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time.   44

(d) The Board of Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to terminate the Company 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, unless Parent notifies the Company in writing not less than 5 business days before the Offer Acceptance Time that it has determined not to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, as provided herein, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, have in effect a tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”) in which each Continuing Employee who is actively employed at the Closing and was a participant in the Company 401(k) Plan shall be eligible to participate as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, and as soon as practicable following the Closing, the account balances under the Company 401(k) Plan shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by the Parent 401(k) Plan, permit such Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of “eligible rollover distributions” within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code (excluding promissory notes evidencing participant loans), in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan. The Board of Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to terminate each other Employee Plan that not less than 5 business days prior to the Closing Date Parent requests that the Company terminate effective as of the Closing Date, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. All resolutions, notices, participant communications or other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan and any other Employee Plan shall be subject to Parent’s prior review and reasonable comment. (e) The provisions of this Section 6.3 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no provision of this Section 6.3 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third- party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation or to any compensation or benefits and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be “at will” employment. 


6.4 ESPP. The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP or otherwise to (A) provide that (i) no new Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) will be commenced following the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, (ii) there will be no increase in the amount of participants’ payroll deduction elections under the Company ESPP during the current Offering Period from those in effect as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) no individuals shall commence participation in the Company ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time and (iv) each purchase right issued pursuant to the Company ESPP shall be fully exercised on the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such Offering Period and (y) the date that is seven business days prior to the Effective Time (with any participant payroll deductions not applied to the purchase of Shares returned to the participant), and (B) terminate the Company ESPP effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.   45

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. (a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of any Acquired Corporation and any indemnification or other similar agreements of any Acquired Corporation, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Acquired Corporations to perform their obligations thereunder. Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter and organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of director, officer and employee (or comparable) liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than those set forth in any Acquired Corporations’ organizational documents as of the Effective Time, which provisions thereafter shall not, for a period of at least six years from the Effective Time, be amended, altered, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Persons, except as required by applicable Legal Requirements. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of any Acquired Corporation or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of any Acquired Corporation as a director or officer of another Person (the “Indemnified Persons”), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of any Acquired Corporation or is or was serving at the request of any Acquired Corporation as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable; provided that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. (b) Prior to the Closing Date, in consultation with Parent, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase (and if the Company does not purchase prior to the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation may purchase on the Closing Date, in lieu of complying with the final sentence of this Section 6.5(b)),“tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently   46

maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations, such tail insurance to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided that in no event shall the cost of any such tail insurance exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such insurance policy in full force and effect for a period of six years following the Closing Date, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. In the event that as of the Closing Date the “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy under the first sentence of this Section 6.5(b) has not been purchased, for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations or provide substitute policies for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an “A” financial strength rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 350% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Acquired Corporations prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Maximum Amount”), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.5(b) it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. (c) In the event that any Acquired Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then in each such case, the Acquired Corporation, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of such Acquired Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. (d) The provisions of this Section 6.5 (i) shall survive the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Persons), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.   47

6.8 Disclosure. The initial press releases of the Company and Parent relating to this Agreement shall be reasonably mutually agreed and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or public statement without the other Party’s written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party); (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be required by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing to be issued or made pursuant to Section 5.3(e) or with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.   48

This Agreement (including its Exhibits, Annexes and the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties and their respective Affiliates, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof (it being acknowledged and agreed that Parent and the Company are also parties to the Collaboration and License Agreement, dated November 15, 2019, which shall continue to apply to the matters governed by such agreement in accordance with its terms). This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. 


9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies.  (a) This Agreement, including all matters of construction, validity and performance and any action or proceeding (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions or any other agreements contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if (but only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware and any appellate court   54








________________


therefrom (collectively, the “Delaware Courts”); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 9.9. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally (1) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Delaware Courts, (2) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Delaware Courts, (3) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Courts and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Delaware Courts. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. (b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.5(a) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH PARTY (I) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 9.5.   55

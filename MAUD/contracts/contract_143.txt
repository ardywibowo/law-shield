(b)    Capital Stock of the Company. (i)    Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares, unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards, which shall be treated as set forth in Section 3.3(a), and Appraisal Shares) (such shares of Company Common Stock, the “Eligible Shares”) shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive from Parent the following consideration (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”): (A) $1.20 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”), and (B) that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Share Consideration”).

________________


(iii)    All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares or by Parent or the Merger Subs immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, “Excluded Shares”) shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 


(c)    Impact of Stock Splits, Etc. In the event of any change in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio (and, in the case of a change pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), the Cash Consideration) shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date of such event, be the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.1(c). Nothing in this Section 3.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement. 


Section 3.2    Conversion of Holdings Class B Units and Cancellation of Company Class B Common Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically and without any further required action by any Person, each Holdings membership interest designated as a Class B unit (the “Holdings Class B Units”), and each corresponding share of Company Class B Common Stock, issued and outstanding at such time shall be converted into Company Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. Upon such conversion, each Holdings Class B Unit, together with each corresponding share of Company Class B Common Stock, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such Holdings Class B Units and corresponding shares of Company Class B Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right of such holder to receive the Merger Consideration in connection with ownership of the resulting Company Class A Common Stock.

________________


Equivalent. Each Parent Restricted Stock Unit Award corresponding to a Company Restricted Stock Unit Award outstanding as of the date hereof shall, except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.3(a), be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that any performance-based vesting condition that applied to the Company Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as having been attained based on target performance, so that such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award will remain solely subject to the time-based vesting requirements in effect for the Company Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


(b)    Settlement Restricted Stock Unit Awards. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit Award granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan prior to the date hereof and that fully vests at the Effective Time or as a result of a termination of employment at or immediately after the Effective time, in either case pursuant to its terms as in effect as of the date hereof shall fully vest and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (net of applicable withholding Taxes) in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


(c)    Administration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall take such action and adopt such resolutions as are required to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.3, (ii) if requested by Parent in writing, cause the Company Stock Plan to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time and (iii) take all actions reasonably required to effectuate any provision of this Section 3.3, including to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any equity awards of the Company, including any Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards, other than to Merger Sub LLC in connection with the Second Merger. 


(d)    Future Grants of Equity Awards. Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.3(a) through Section 3.3(c) to the contrary, but subject to Section 6.1(b), if mutually agreed by the Parties and a holder of any Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, then the terms of such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award shall control (and the applicable provisions of this Section 3.3 shall not apply). 


Section 3.4    Payment for Securities; Exchange. (a)    Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into an agreement with Parent’s or the Company’s transfer agent to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the First Merger (the “Exchange Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration and all cash payable pursuant to this Article III. On the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the Certificate of First Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance with this Article III through the Exchange Agent, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to Section 3.1 and (ii) sufficient cash to (A) make delivery of the Cash Consideration in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to   9








________________


Section 3.1 and (B) make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.4(h). Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.4(g). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 3.4(a), Section 3.4(g) and Section 3.4(h), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.4(g)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. To the extent, for any reason, the amount in the Exchange Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III, Parent shall promptly replace, restore or supplement the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III. Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Company. 


(b)    Payment Procedures. (i)    Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an outstanding Eligible Share represented by a certificate (“Certificates”), and a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i). Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates that formerly represented the Eligible Shares held by any record holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of the Eligible Share(s) formerly represented by such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all Eligible Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (B) a check or wire transfer in an aggregate amount equal to the Cash Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all Eligible Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time), plus the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(h) and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.4(g).   10








________________


(ii)    Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Eligible Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) not held through DTC, (A) a statement reflecting the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all Eligible Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (B) a check or wire transfer in an aggregate amount equal to the Cash Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all Eligible Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time), plus the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(h) and any dividends and other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(g). (iii)    DTC Book-Entry Shares. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, the cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.4(h), if any, and any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III. (iv)    No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration or any other amount payable in respect of any Eligible Shares pursuant to this Article III. (v)    With respect to any Eligible Shares represented by Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time, if payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(g) and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(h)) is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(g) and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(h)) shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time. Until surrendered as   11








________________


contemplated by this Section 3.4(b)(v) (together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (and delivery of such duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal with such other customary documents) the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.4(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(g). 


(c)    Termination of Rights. All Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(g) and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(h)) paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately with respect to shares outstanding prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


(d)    Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Eligible Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(h) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(g), in each case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts. 


(e)    No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Subs, Holdings or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of the Eligible Shares represented by such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Eligible Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(f)    Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to   12








________________


such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Eligible Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.4(g). 


(g)    Dividends or Other Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by an unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.4. Following surrender of any such Certificate (together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent), there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender (and delivery of such duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal with such other customary documents), the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and delivery and a payment date subsequent to such surrender and delivery payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the First Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. 


(h)    No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. No fractional shares or certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and no holder of Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have any right to vote or have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of the fractional shares such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time exchanged pursuant to the First Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Eligible Shares formerly represented by Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. (the “Parent Closing Price”). As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to a holder of Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof when payable   13








________________


pursuant to this Article III. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the conversion of the Eligible Shares in the First Merger. 


(i)    Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Appraisal Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1 but instead at the Effective Time shall become entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and at the Effective Time all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to an appraisal of such holder’s shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal Shares and (ii) the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Effective Time, each such Appraisal Share shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(g) and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(h)) upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Article III. The Company shall deliver prompt written notice (including all accompanying relevant documents and instruments) to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the “fair value” of Appraisal Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, and the Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to the Appraisal Shares without the prior written consent of Parent. 


(j)    Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Merger Subs, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law and shall pay the amount deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law. Parent, the Merger Subs, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize any such deduction or withholding. To the extent such amounts are so properly deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company, the Merger Subs or Parent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having   14








________________


been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock to whom such amounts would have been paid absent such deduction or withholding by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company, the Merger Subs or Parent, as the case may be. 


Section 3.5    Effect of the Second Merger on Capital Stock and LLC Interests. At the Second Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company, (i) each share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time (and, for the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect to the First Merger) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor and (ii) each limited liability company interest in Merger Sub LLC outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall remain outstanding as an identical limited liability company interest in the Surviving Company and shall be unaffected by the Second Merger. 


ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE GROUP COMPANIES 


Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered by the Group Companies to Parent and the Merger Subs on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Letter”) and except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) filed with or furnished to the SEC and available on Edgar since March 18, 2021 (the “Applicable Date”) and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth or referenced in any risk factor section or in any other section, in each case, to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive, non-specific or forward-looking in nature), the Group Companies, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Parent and the Merger Subs as follows: 


Section 4.1    Organization, Standing and Power. Each Group Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly incorporated, organized or formed, as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation, with all requisite entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, other than, in the case of each Group Company’s Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized or to have such power, authority or standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on each Group Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a “Company Material Adverse Effect”). Each Group Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its assets and properties, makes such qualification or license necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify, license or be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Group Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Organizational Documents and the Organizational Documents of each of its Subsidiaries, each as amended prior to the execution of this Agreement and each as made available to Parent is in full force and effect, and neither Group Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of such Organizational Documents.   15

The Company has duly adopted resolutions in its capacity as the managing member of Holdings pursuant to which the Company has determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair and reasonable to, and advisable and in the best interests of, Holdings and its members, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and authorized Holdings’ entry into this Agreement and consummation of the Transactions (the “Holdings Managing Member Approval”).

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all of its material obligations with respect to such Rights-of-Way and conduct their business in a manner that does not violate any of the Rights-of-Way and no event has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Rights-of-Way, except for such revocations, terminations and impairments that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All pipelines operated by the Company and its Subsidiaries are located on or are subject to valid Rights-of-Way or are located on real property owned or leased by the Company, and there are no gaps (including any gap arising as a result of any breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the terms of any Rights-of-Way) in the Rights-of-Way other than gaps that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, other than as disclosed on Schedule 4.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Right-of-Way contains a requirement that the holder thereof make royalty or other payments based, directly or indirectly, on the throughput of Hydrocarbons on or across such Right-of-Way (other than customary royalties under oil and gas leases based solely on Hydrocarbons produced from such oil and gas lease).

(ii) reflected in the Company Reserve Reports or in the Company SEC Documents as having been sold or otherwise disposed of (other than sales or dispositions after the date hereof in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(v)), the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as set forth on Schedule 4.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Company Reserve Reports and in each case as attributable to interests owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, “good and defensible title” means that the Company’s and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries’, as applicable, title (as of the date hereof and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them) that (1) entitles the Company (and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest share shown in the Company Reserve Reports of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the productive life of such Oil and Gas Properties (other than decreases in connection with operations in which the Company and/or its Subsidiaries may be a non-consenting co-owner from and after the date of the Company Reserve Reports, decreases resulting from reversion of interests to co-owners with respect to operations in which such co-owners elected not to consent from and after the date of the Company Reserve Reports, and decreases resulting from the establishment of pools or units from and after the date of the Company Reserve Reports), (2) obligates the Company (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on the Company Reserve Reports for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive differences in such percentage) and the applicable working interest shown on the Company Reserve Reports for such Oil and Gas Properties that are accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) increase in the net revenue interest in such Oil and Gas Properties and (3) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances). 


(b)    Except for any such matters that, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by the Company to the Company Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the Company’s interests referred to in the Company Reserve Reports, by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries that was material to such firm’s estimates of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided, accurate in all respects.

Except for any such matters that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of the Company set forth in the Company Reserve Reports are derived from reports that have been prepared by the Company Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Reports that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   30

basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report and in each case as attributable to interests owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, “good and defensible title” means that Parent’s and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries’, as applicable, title (as of the date hereof and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them) that (A) entitles Parent (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest share shown in the Parent Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the productive life of such Oil and Gas Properties, (B) obligates Parent (and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on the Parent Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive differences in such percentage) and the applicable working interest shown on the Parent Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) increase in the net revenue interest in such Oil and Gas Properties and (C) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

Except for any such matters that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of Parent set forth in the Parent Reserve Report are derived from reports that have been prepared by the Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of Parent and its Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

If requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly provide Parent with all voting tabulation reports relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by the Company or the Company’s transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or written communications from or to the Company’s stockholders with respect thereto. Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation made in accordance with Section 6.3, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Company’s stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Company Stockholder Approval from being obtained. The Company, in consultation with Parent, shall fix a record date for determining the stockholders of the Company entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the Company agrees that its obligations to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation and its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the commencement, announcement, disclosure, or communication to the Company of any Company Competing Proposal or other proposal (including, as applicable, a Company Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or disclosure of any Company Intervening Event. 


(c)    Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall duly adopt this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub Inc. in accordance with applicable Law and the Organizational Documents of Merger Sub Inc. and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent so adopting this Agreement.   64

The inspecting Party and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the other Party or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the other Party and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i)    No Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information, as applicable, to the other Party or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such information, as applicable, is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing contract or agreement (provided, however, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through the use of commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party required to provide such information and (B) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the Parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege);   65








________________


(ii)    No Party shall have access to personnel records of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other personnel information that in the other Party’s good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability; (iii)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall be permitted to conduct any invasive or intrusive sampling or analysis (commonly known as a “Phase II”) of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of the other Party or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the other Party (which may be granted or withheld in such Party’s sole discretion); and (iv)    No investigation or information provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub Inc. or Merger Sub LLC herein and no Party shall, and each Party shall cause their respective Representatives to not, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.6 for any purpose unrelated to the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the Transactions. 


(b)    The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June 11, 2021 between Parent and the Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, each Party shall continue to provide access to the other Party and its Representatives to the data relating to the Transactions maintained by or on behalf of it to which the other Party and its Representatives were provided access prior to the date of this Agreement. 


Section 6.7    HSR and Other Approvals. (a)    Except for the Consents pursuant to Antitrust Laws to which Sections 6.7(b) and 6.7(c), and not this Section 6.7(a), shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities and other third parties all Consents that are necessary in order to consummate the Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of, such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to Sections 6.7(b) and 6.7(c)), in no event shall either the Company or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be required to pay any consideration to any third parties or give anything of value to obtain any such Person’s Consent to effectuate the Transactions, other than filing, recordation or similar fees. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent reasonably practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as applicable, and any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection   66

with the Transactions (including the Proxy Statement). The Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any Consents in connection with the Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may be withheld in Parent’s sole discretion). 


(b)    As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall make any filings required under the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any reasonable request for information from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization, restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger or acquisition (collectively, “Antitrust Laws”), including the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United States, or any other competition authority of any jurisdiction (“Antitrust Authority”). Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any material substantive communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Antitrust Authority. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to offer, propose, negotiate, commit to, agree to, or take any action or accept or impose any restriction or limitation, including but not limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate or agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (each a “Divestiture Action”). The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) agree to take any Divestiture Action requested in writing by Parent if such actions are only effective after the Effective Time and conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions. The Company shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to) offer, propose, negotiate, commit to, agree to, or take any Divestiture Action without Parent’s prior written consent. In the event that any action is instituted by an Antitrust Authority challenging either Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to defend such action. Parent shall be entitled to direct any Proceedings with any Antitrust Authority relating to any of the foregoing, provided, however, that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein. The Parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this Section 6.7(b) so as to preserve any applicable privilege.   67

Section 6.8    Employee Matters. (a)    Until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause each individual who is employed as of the Closing Date by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof (a “Company Employee”) and who remains employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to be provided with (i) a total target cash compensation opportunity (consisting of base salary or wages, as applicable, and annual cash incentive opportunities) that is no less favorable than either that provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date or to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, provided that a Company Employee’s base compensation (salary or wages, as applicable) shall not be reduced below the level in effect for such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date; (ii) eligibility for equity compensation to the same extent as provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, provided that the amount of such equity compensation may be adjusted to avoid duplication that otherwise may arise as a result of differences in timing of grants by the Company prior to the Closing Date and by Parent following the Closing Date; (iii) employee benefits (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, incentives and equity compensation, which are covered above) at a level that is no less favorable in the aggregate than either the employee benefits in effect for such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date or the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees or Parent and its Subsidiaries; and (iv) eligibility for severance benefits on terms no less favorable than those provided pursuant to the Company’s severance arrangements in place as of the date hereof and identified on Schedule 4.10(a).

Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, to give service credit for long term disability coverage purposes for the Company Employees’ service with the Company and its Subsidiaries.

dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health and welfare Parent Plan to the extent such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents are covered under a Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and such conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such Company Benefit Plan and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which payment has been made, in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan provider. 


(e)    It is acknowledged and agreed that the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a “change of control” (or “change in control” or transaction of similar import) for purposes of the arrangements identified on Schedule 6.8(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 


(f)    Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall adopt resolutions and take all such corporate action as is necessary to terminate each 401(k) plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company 401(k) Plans”), in each case, effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plans have been properly terminated, the form of such termination documents shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. To the extent the Company 401(k) Plans are terminated pursuant to Parent’s request, the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries. 


(g)    For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid time off to which each Company Employee is entitled during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, Parent, the Surviving Company or one of their Subsidiaries will credit such Company Employee for such Company Employee’s service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into account under the applicable Company Benefit Plans, and Parent, the Surviving Company or one of their Subsidiaries will assume and honor all unused vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned by each Company Employee through the Closing, pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit Parent or the Surviving Company from amending or modifying its applicable vacation policies as in effect from time to time so long as Parent and Surviving Company comply with the provisions of this Section 6.8(g).

Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.9, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Company (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.9 except to the extent such failure prejudices Parent, the Surviving Company or such Party’s position with respect to such claims or liability therefor). 


(b)    Parent and the Surviving Company agree that, until the six (6) year anniversary date of the Closing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would) adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by applicable Law.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this “Agreement”) dated as of June 1, 2021, is by and between First Bancorp, a North Carolina corporation (“Buyer”), and Select Bancorp, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (“SB”). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not defined elsewhere herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in Section 10.1 hereof. Recitals WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Buyer and SB have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and shareholders for SB to merge with and into Buyer, with Buyer being the surviving entity (the “Merger”) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and have unanimously approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby the issued and outstanding shares of SB Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration from Buyer; WHEREAS, the board of directors of SB has recommended that SB’s shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “SB Recommendation”); WHEREAS, the board of directors of Buyer has recommended that Buyer’s shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Buyer Recommendation”); WHEREAS, as a material inducement and as additional consideration to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers of SB have entered into a voting agreement with Buyer dated as of the date hereof (each a “Support Agreement” and collectively, the “Support Agreements”), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, pursuant to which each such Person has agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of SB Common Stock owned by such Person in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; WHEREAS, the Merger is subject to the approvals of the shareholders of SB and the shareholders of Buyer, regulatory agencies, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement; WHEREAS, Buyer and SB desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: ARTICLE 1 TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION 1.1 Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, SB shall merge with and into Buyer in accordance with the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the “NCBCA”), and Buyer shall be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of North Carolina. The Merger shall be consummated in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

1.2 Time and Place of Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Closing”) will take place at 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time on the date that the Effective Time occurs, or at such other time as the Parties, acting through their authorized officers, may mutually agree. The Closing shall be held at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties and may be effected by electronic or other transmission of signature pages, as mutually agreed upon. 1.3 Effective Time. The Merger shall be consummated by filing Articles of Merger reflecting the Merger (the “Articles of Merger”) with the Secretary of State of North Carolina. The Merger shall become effective (the “Effective Time”) when the Articles of Merger have been accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of North Carolina or at such later time as may be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and SB and specified in the Articles of Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur within five (5) business days of the last of the following dates to occur: (i) the effective date (including expiration of any applicable waiting period) of the last required Consent of any Regulatory Authority having authority over and approving or exempting the Merger, (ii) the date on which the shareholders of SB approve this Agreement, (iii) the date on which the shareholders of Buyer approve this Agreement; or (iv) expiration of the period specified within Section 9.1(g). 1.4 Restructure of Transactions. Buyer shall have the right to request a revision to the structure of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement by merging SB directly with and into a subsidiary of Buyer, provided, that no such revision to the structure of the Merger (i) shall result in any changes in the amount or type of consideration which the holders of shares of SB Common Stock or SB Options are entitled to receive under this Agreement, (ii) would unreasonably impede or delay consummation of the Merger, (iii) shall impose any less favorable terms or conditions on SB, or (iv) affect the Tax Treatment of the Merger. Buyer may request such revision by giving written notice to SB in the manner provided in Section 10.8, which notice shall be in the form of a proposed amendment to this Agreement or in the form of an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, and the addition of such other exhibits hereto as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to effect such change. 1.5 Bank Merger. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, First Bank (“Buyer Bank”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, and Select Bank & Trust Company (the “Bank”), a wholly owned subsidiary of SB, shall enter into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Bank Merger Agreement”), with such changes thereto as Buyer and SB shall mutually agree, pursuant to which Bank will merge with and into Buyer Bank (the “Bank Merger”). The Bank Merger shall not occur prior to the Effective Time. 1.6 Tax Treatment of the Merger. It is intended by the Parties that the Merger constitute a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation








________________


Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). The Parties agree to cooperate and use their best efforts in order to qualify the transactions contemplated herein as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, to not take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to so qualify, and to report the Merger for federal, state and any local income Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such characterization.

ARTICLE 2 TERMS OF MERGER 2.1 Articles of Incorporation. The articles of incorporation of Buyer in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until otherwise duly amended or repealed. 2.2 Bylaws. The bylaws of Buyer in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until otherwise duly amended or repealed. 2.3 Directors and Officers. The directors of Buyer in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with such additional Persons as may thereafter be elected or validly appointed, shall serve as the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time in accordance with the Surviving Corporation’s bylaws, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall take all action necessary to appoint two (2) members of the current SB board of directors designated by such board and approved by the board of directors of Buyer, such approval to not be unreasonably withheld, to the board of directors of Buyer and Buyer Bank, to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the next business day following the Effective Time. The officers of Buyer in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with such additional Persons as may thereafter be appointed, shall serve as the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time in accordance with the Surviving Corporation’s bylaws, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer. ARTICLE 3 MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES 3.1 Effect on SB Common Stock. (a) At the Effective Time, in each case subject to Sections 3.1(d) and 3.2, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties, each share of SB Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Extinguished Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.408 of a share of Buyer Common Stock (the “Merger Consideration”). (b) At the Effective Time, all shares of SB Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of SB Common Stock (the “Certificates”) or book entry notation of ownership shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. (c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of SB Common Stock, the SB Options, the outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock, or any rights with respect to Buyer Common Stock pursuant to stock options granted by Buyer (the “Buyer Options”) are increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in each case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have the right to grant additional stock options or other equity based awards under its existing equity based compensation plans (“Buyer Awards”), and holders of SB Options shall have the right to exercise SB Options outstanding as of the date of this Agreement without triggering an adjustment to the Merger Consideration under this Section 3.1(c). (d) Each share of SB Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of the Parties or their respective Subsidiaries (in each case other than shares of SB Common Stock held on behalf of third parties or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor, and cease to exist (the “Extinguished Shares”).

3.2 Exchange Procedures. (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit with Computershare Limited or such other exchange agent selected by Buyer (the “Exchange Agent”) for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.2, the Merger Consideration and cash in an aggregate amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which holders of SB Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.6 (collectively, the “Exchange Fund”). In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder (including pursuant to Section 3.6), Buyer shall promptly make available to the Exchange Agent the amounts so required to satisfy such payment obligations in full. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 3.2, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose. (b) Unless different timing is agreed to by Buyer and SB, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event no more than seven (7) business days after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the former shareholders of SB appropriate transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or other instruments theretofore representing shares of SB Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or other instruments to the Exchange Agent). In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of SB Common Stock represented by one or more Certificates that are not registered in the transfer records of SB, the Merger Consideration payable for such shares as provided in Section 3.1 may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares are delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence such transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that such transfer is proper and that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. In the event any Certificate representing SB Common Stock shall have been lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Buyer may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration as provided for in Section 3.1. The Exchange Agent may establish such other reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its duties as it may deem appropriate. Such transmittal materials shall contain appropriate instructions for the distribution of the Merger Consideration to holders of SB Common Stock ownership noted in book entry form in the stock records of SB. Buyer shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent in connection with the distribution of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1. Buyer or the Exchange Agent will maintain a book entry list of Buyer Common Stock to which each former holder of SB Common Stock is entitled. Certificates evidencing Buyer

Common Stock into which SB Common Stock has been converted will not be issued. (c) Unless different timing is agreed to by Buyer and SB, after the Effective Time, each holder of shares of SB Common Stock (other than Extinguished Shares) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender the Certificate or Certificates representing, such shares, or shall provide appropriate instructions with respect to such shares held in book entry notation form, to the Exchange Agent and shall promptly upon surrender thereof or the giving of such instructions receive in exchange therefor the consideration provided in Section 3.1, without interest, pursuant to this Section 3.2. The Certificate or Certificates of SB Common Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require. Buyer shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder of SB Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such holder’s Certificate or Certificates for exchange as provided in this Section 3.2. Similarly, no dividends or other distributions in respect of the Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Certificates until such Certificate or Certificates (or affidavit in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(b)) are surrendered for exchange as provided in this Section 3.2. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither any Buyer Entity, nor any SB Entity, nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of SB Common Stock for any amounts paid or properly delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law. 


4 


(d) Each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of SB Common Stock and SB Options such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law or by any Taxing Authority or Governmental Authority; provided, however, that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give SB advance notice of its intentions to make any such deduction or withholding and cooperate in good faith with SB to mitigate any such deduction or withholding to the extent permitted by Law (other than with respect to payments in respect of SB Options described in Section 3.4). To the extent that any amounts are so withheld by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of SB Common Stock or SB Options, as applicable in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration and cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.2(a) that remains unclaimed by the holder of shares of SB Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any holder of shares of SB Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with Section 3.2(c) shall thereafter look only to Buyer for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of SB Common Stock such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of SB Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable Law, become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of SB Common Stock for any consideration paid to a Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of SB to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate or Certificates, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto. (f) Adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of SB shall constitute ratification of the appointment of the Exchange Agent. 3.3 Effect on Buyer Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger. 3.4 SB Options. (a) At the Effective Time, each Right with respect to SB Common Stock pursuant to stock options (the “SB Options”) granted by SB under SB’s 2004 Incentive Stock Option Plan, 2008 Omnibus Stock Ownership and Long Term Incentive Plan, 2010 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan or 2018 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the “SB Option Plans”) which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of SB Common Stock subject to such SB Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the excess of $18.00 over the exercise price per share of such SB Option, less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise price per share of any such SB Option is equal to or greater than $18.00, such SB Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Subject to the foregoing, the SB Option Plans and all SB Options issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time. 


5 


(b) Neither SB’s board of directors nor its compensation committee shall make any grants of SB Options following the execution of this Agreement. (c) SB’s board of directors or its compensation committee shall make any adjustments or amendments to or make such determinations with respect to the SB Options necessary to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4. 3.5 Rights of Former SB Shareholders. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of SB shall be closed as to holders of SB Common Stock and no transfer of SB Common Stock by any holder of such shares shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2, each Certificate theretofore representing shares of SB Common Stock (other than Certificates representing Extinguished Shares), shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in this Article 3. 3.6 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of SB Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger, who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder), shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by $44.12. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other Rights as a shareholder in respect of any fractional shares. ARTICLE 4 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SB SB represents and warrants to Buyer as follows, except as set forth on the SB Disclosure Memorandum with respect to each Section below. 4.1 Organization, Standing, and Power.

(a) SB has the corporate power and authority necessary (i) to execute, deliver, and, other than with respect to the Merger, perform this Agreement, and (ii) with respect to the Merger, upon the approval of the Merger, including any approvals referred to in Sections 8.1(b) and 8.1(c) and by SB’s shareholders in accordance with this Agreement and the NCBCA, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Subject to any approvals referred to in Sections 8.1(b) and 8.1(c) and receipt of such Requisite SB Shareholder Approval, this Agreement represents a legal, valid, and binding obligation of SB, enforceable against SB in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought). (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by SB, nor the consummation by SB and Bank of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by SB and Bank with any of the provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of SB’s articles of incorporation or bylaws or the articles of incorporation or bylaws of any SB Subsidiary or any resolution adopted by the board of directors or the shareholders of any SB Entity, or (ii) except as disclosed in Section 4.2(b) of the SB Disclosure Memorandum, constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to, or result in the creation of any Lien on any material Asset of any SB Entity under, any material Contract or any material Permit of any SB Entity, or (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite Consents referred to in Section 8.1(c), constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to, any Law or Order applicable to any SB Entity or any of their respective material Assets (including any Buyer Entity or any SB Entity becoming subject to or liable for the payment of any Tax on any Assets owned by any Buyer Entity or any SB Entity being reassessed or revalued by any Regulatory Authority).

(a) The authorized capital stock of SB consists of 50,000,000 shares of SB Common Stock, of which 17,227,104 shares are issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, and assuming that all of the issued and outstanding SB Options had been exercised, not more than an additional 306,589 shares would be issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, and 5,000,000 shares of SB preferred stock, of which no shares are issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. If the SB Options were exercised as of the date of this Agreement, 306,589 shares of SB Common Stock would be issued at a per share weighted average exercise price of $10.14. Section 4.3(a) of the SB Disclosure Memorandum lists all issued and outstanding SB Options, which schedule includes the names of the recipients, the date of grant, the exercise prices, the vesting schedules, and the expiration dates, to the extent applicable. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of SB are duly and validly issued and outstanding and are fully paid and nonassessable.

(c) Each SB Benefit Plan is in material compliance with the terms of such SB Benefit Plan and in compliance with all applicable Laws, including the Code and ERISA. Each SB ERISA Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or opinion from the IRS or, in the alternative, appropriately relies upon a favorable determination letter issued to a prototype plan under which the SB ERISA Plan has been adopted and, to the Knowledge of SB, there are no circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. SB has not received any written communication from any Governmental Authority questioning or challenging the compliance of any SB Benefit Plan with applicable Laws. No SB Benefit Plan is currently being audited by any Governmental Authority for compliance with applicable Laws or has been audited with a determination by any Governmental Authority that the SB Benefit Plan failed to comply with applicable Laws. (d) There has been no material oral or written representation or communication with respect to any aspect of the Employee Benefit Plans made to employees of any SB Entity which is not in all material respects in accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such plans. Neither SB, any SB Entity, nor, to the Knowledge of SB, any administrator or fiduciary of any SB Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing) has engaged in any transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner, which could subject SB, any SB Entity, or Buyer to any direct or indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any fiduciary, co-fiduciary, or other duty under ERISA. There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, SB Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits which are payable in the ordinary course of business consistent with the terms of the applicable plan, and no action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing, or investigation has been commenced with respect to any SB Benefit Plan other than routine claims for benefits. (e) All SB Benefit Plan documents and annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations, summary annual reports, and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to the SB Benefit Plans are correct and complete in all material respects, to the extent applicable, have been timely filed with the IRS, the DOL, or PBGC, and distributed to participants of the SB Benefit Plans (as required by Law), and there have been no material misstatements or omissions in the information set forth therein. (f) To the Knowledge of SB, no “party in interest” (as defined in ERISA Section 3(14)) or “disqualified person” (as defined in Code Section 4975(e) (2)) of any SB Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt “prohibited transaction” (as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406). (g) No SB Entity nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, or ever has had, any obligation or Liability in connection with, a SB Pension Plan, or any plan that is or was subject to Code Section 412, ERISA Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA, or any multiemployer plan (as defined in Sections 4001(a)(3) or 3(37) of ERISA). (h) No material Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by any SB Entity or any ERISA Affiliate thereof, and no event has occurred that could reasonably result in Liability under Title IV of ERISA being incurred by any SB Entity or any ERISA Affiliate thereof with respect to any ongoing, frozen, terminated, or other single-employer plan of any SB Entity or the single-employer plan of any ERISA Affiliate. Except as may arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there has been no “reportable event,” within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043, for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived by any ongoing, frozen, terminated or other single employer plan of SB or of an ERISA Affiliate. (i) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(i) of the SB Disclosure Memorandum, or required under Part 6 of ERISA or Code Section 4980B or similar state law, no SB Entity has any material Liability or obligation for retiree or post-termination of employment or services health or life benefits under any of the SB Benefit Plans, or other plan or arrangement, and there are no restrictions on the Rights of such SB Entity to unilaterally amend or terminate any and all such retiree or post-termination of employment or services health or benefit plan without incurring any Liability or obtaining any consent or waiver. No Tax under Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any SB Benefit Plan or other plan or arrangement, and to the Knowledge of SB, no circumstance exists that could give rise to such Taxes. (j) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(j) of the SB Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in connection with any other event) will (i) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, “excess parachute payment” as defined under Code Section 280G, or otherwise) becoming due from any SB Entity under any SB Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any SB Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit, or any benefit under any life insurance owned by any SB Entity or the Rights of any SB Entity in, to or under any insurance on the life of any current or former officer, director, or employee of any SB Entity, or change any Rights or obligations of any SB Entity with respect to such insurance.

(k) Section 4.15(k) of the SB Disclosure Memorandum sets forth preliminary calculations, based on assumptions set forth therein, of the following: (i) the amount of all payments and benefits to which each individual set forth on such SB Disclosure Memorandum is entitled to receive (as determined based on the valuation principles and methodologies described in Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), pursuant to all employment, salary continuation, bonus, change in control, and all other agreements, plans and arrangements, in connection with a termination of employment before or following, or otherwise in connection with or contingent upon, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding payments or benefits in respect of vested equity awards) (each such total amount in respect of each such individual, the “Change in Control Benefit”), other than the payment any such individual shall otherwise be entitled to receive as a gross-up payment in respect of any excise tax imposed on the individual pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code as calculated pursuant to the applicable agreement (any each such payment, a “Gross-Up Payment”); (ii) the amount of any Gross-Up Payment payable to each such individual; and (iii) the aggregate amount of all Change in Control Benefits and Gross-Up Payments. (l) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(l) of the SB Disclosure Memorandum, no SB Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated with, or related to a “voluntary employee’s beneficiary association” within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a “welfare benefit fund” within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code, a “qualified asset account” within the meaning of Section 419A of the Code or a “multiple employer welfare arrangement” within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. The actuarial present values of all accrued deferred compensation entitlements (including entitlements under any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of employees and former employees of any SB Entity and their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans, whether or not subject to the provisions of Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302, have been reflected on the SB Financial Statements in all material respects to the extent required by and in accordance with GAAP. (m) Each SB Benefit Plan that is a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS with respect to such plans or is not required to comply therewith due to its grandfathered status under Section 409A of the Code. (n) All individuals who render services to any SB Entity and who are authorized to participate in an SB Benefit Plan pursuant to the terms of such SB Benefit Plan are in fact eligible to and authorized to participate in such SB Benefit Plan. All SB Entities have, for purposes of the SB Benefit Plans and all other purposes, correctly classified all individuals performing services for such SB Entity as common law employees, independent

Each SB Entity will, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and will continue to have until the Effective Time, notwithstanding this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, all ownership rights and interest in all corporate or bank-owned life insurance. (q) Each SB ERISA Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code so qualifies, and its related trust is tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of SB, no event has occurred and no condition exists that could cause the loss of such qualified or tax exempt status. (r) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(r) of the SB Disclosure Memorandum, with respect to each SB Pension Plan, (i) all contributions required to be made under Sections 412 and 430 of the Code with respect to such SB Pension Plan have been made timely, (ii) there has been no application for any waiver of the minimum funding standards imposed by Section 412 of the Code, and such minimum funding standards have been met to date, and (iii) there is not any “amount of unfunded benefit liabilities” as defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA under such SB Pension Plan.

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, do any of the following, without the prior written Consent of SB (which Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned): (a) amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws or similar governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries in a manner that changes any material term or provision of Buyer Common Stock or that otherwise would materially and adversely affect the economic benefits of the Merger to the holders of SB Common Stock or would materially impede Buyer’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) knowingly take any action that would prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; (c) set any record or payment dates for the payment of any dividends or distributions on its capital stock or other equity interest, or make, declare or pay any dividend or distribution (except for (A) dividends paid in the ordinary course of business by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Buyer Subsidiary to Buyer or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Buyer Subsidiary, or (B) a quarterly cash dividend on Buyer Common Stock at a rate not substantially greater than the rate paid by it during the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date hereof and payment dates consistent with past practice); (d) take any action or fail to take any action that at the time of such action or inaction is reasonably likely to prevent or would be reasonably likely to materially interfere with, the consummation of the Merger; or (e) agree to or make any commitment to, take, or adopt any resolutions of the board of directors of Buyer in support of, any of the actions prohibited by this Section 6.3. 6.4 Control of the Other Party’s Business. Prior to the Effective Time, nothing contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3) shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of SB or any SB Entity, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give SB, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Buyer or any Buyer Entity. Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over it and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations. 6.5 Adverse Changes in Condition.

30 


6.6 Reports. Each of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and SB and its Subsidiaries shall file all reports required to be filed by it with Regulatory Authorities between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time and shall make available to the other Party copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed. SB and its Subsidiaries shall also make available to Buyer monthly financial statements and quarterly call reports. The financial statements of Buyer and SB, whether or not contained in any such reports filed under the Exchange Act or with any other Regulatory Authority, will fairly present the consolidated financial position of the entity filing such statements as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial statements to normal recurring year-end adjustments). As of their respective dates, such reports of Buyer and SB filed under the Exchange Act or with any other Regulatory Authority will comply in all material respects with the Securities Laws and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Any financial statements contained in any other reports to another Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in accordance with the Laws applicable to such reports. 6.7 Buyer Entity Use and Disclosure of IIPI. Buyer acknowledges that IIPI disclosed to Buyer Entities in connection with this Agreement has been and will be disclosed pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 6802(e)(7) and 12 C.F.R. § 1016.15(a)(6). Buyer Entities may not use or disclose IIPI, nor permit the use or disclosure of IIPI, other than as necessary to consummate and to make effective the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby as permitted under 15 U.S.C. § 6802(e)(7) and 12 C.F.R. § 1016.15(a)(6). ARTICLE 7 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 7.1 Shareholder Approvals. (a) SB shall submit to its shareholders this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, SB shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene, and hold SB’s Shareholders’ Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose of considering and voting on approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions provided for in this Agreement. SB’s board of directors shall recommend that its shareholders approve this Agreement in accordance with the NCBCA and shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus delivered to shareholders of SB, except to the extent SB’s board of directors has made an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined below) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. SB shall solicit and use its reasonable efforts to obtain the Requisite SB Shareholder Approval. (b) Buyer shall submit to its shareholders this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, Buyer shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene, and hold Buyer’s Shareholders’ Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose of considering and voting on approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions provided for in this Agreement. Buyer’s board of directors shall recommend that its shareholders approve this Agreement in accordance with the NCBCA and shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus delivered to shareholders of Buyer. Buyer shall solicit and use its reasonable

efforts to obtain the Requisite Buyer Shareholder Approval. (c) Neither SB’s board of directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.1, (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer, the SB Recommendation, or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (each, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Requisite SB Shareholder Approval, SB’s board of directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if and only if: (A) SB’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the SB Financial Advisor (or such other financial advisor as SB may use) and outside counsel, that it has received an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of Section 7.3) that is a Superior Proposal; (B) SB’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with SB’s outside counsel, that a failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with SB’s board of directors’ fiduciary duties to SB and its shareholders under applicable Law; 


31 


(C) SB’s board of directors provides written notice (a “Notice of Recommendation Change”) to Buyer of its receipt of the Superior Proposal and its intent to announce an Adverse Recommendation Change on the third business day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (and include a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in writing) and identify the Person or Group making such Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the three business day period referred to in this clause (C) and in clauses (D) and (E) shall be reduced to two business days following the giving of such new Notice of Recommendation Change); (D) after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, SB shall negotiate in good faith with Buyer (if requested by Buyer) and provide Buyer reasonable opportunity during the subsequent three business day period to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable SB’s board of directors to proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change (provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to propose any such adjustments); and (E) SB’s board of directors, following such three business day period, again determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties to SB and its shareholders under applicable Law. 7.2 Registration of Buyer Common Stock. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event, within 50 days) following the date hereof, Buyer shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall contain proxy materials relating to the matters to be submitted to SB’s shareholders at SB’s Shareholders’ Meeting and to Buyer’s shareholders at Buyer’s Shareholders’ Meeting. Such proxy materials shall also constitute the prospectus relating to the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. SB will furnish to Buyer the information required to be included in the Registration Statement with respect to its business and affairs and shall have the right to review and consult with Buyer on the form of, and any characterizations of such information included in, the Registration Statement prior to its being filed with the SEC. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer and SB will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be delivered to the SB shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Buyer will advise SB, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Buyer Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Buyer or SB, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Buyer or SB which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party hereto and, to the extent required by Law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by Buyer with the SEC and disseminated by the Parties to their respective shareholders. 


32 


(b) Buyer shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state Securities Laws in connection with the Merger and each of Buyer and SB shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of SB Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall notify The Nasdaq Stock Market of the additional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued by Buyer in exchange for the shares of SB Common Stock. 7.3 Other Offers, etc. (a) From the date of this Agreement through the first to occur of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, each SB Entity shall not, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, or encourage, induce or knowingly facilitate, the making, submission, or announcement of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions (except to notify a third party of the existence of restrictions provided in this Section 7.3) or negotiations regarding, or disclose or provide any nonpublic information with respect to, or knowingly take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement (including any agreement in principle, letter of intent or understanding, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, or share exchange agreement, but excluding a confidentiality agreement of the type described below) (an “Acquisition Agreement”) contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction, or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that prior to receipt of the Requisite SB Shareholder Approval, this Section 7.3 shall not prohibit a SB Entity from furnishing nonpublic information regarding any SB Entity or other access to, or entering into a confidentiality agreement or discussions or negotiations with, any Person or Group in response to a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person or Group (and not withdrawn) if and only if: (A) no SB Entity or Representative or Affiliate thereof shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.3 (other than an unintentional violation that did not, directly or indirectly, result in the








________________


submission of such Acquisition Proposal), (B) SB’s board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the SB Financial Advisor (or such other financial advisor as SB may use) and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, (C) SB’s board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to SB and its shareholders, (D) SB receives from such Person or Group an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to SB than the confidentiality terms of this Agreement, and (E) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person or Group, SB furnishes such nonpublic information to Buyer (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by SB to Buyer). In addition to the foregoing, SB shall provide Buyer with at least three (3) days’ prior written notice of a meeting of SB’s board of directors at which meeting SB’s board of directors is reasonably expected to resolve to recommend the Acquisition Agreement as a Superior Proposal to its shareholders, and SB shall keep Buyer informed on a prompt basis of the status and material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. (b) In addition to the obligations of SB set forth in this Section 7.3, as promptly as reasonably practicable, after any of the directors or executive officers of SB become aware thereof, SB shall advise Buyer of any request received by SB for nonpublic information which SB reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the Person or Group making any such request or Acquisition Proposal. SB shall keep Buyer informed promptly of material amendments or modifications to any such request or Acquisition Proposal. (c) Except as specifically permitted under Section 7.3(a), SB shall immediately cease, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ directors, officers, employees, and Representatives to immediately cease, any and all existing activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use and cause to be used all commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar or related agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 


33 


(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party or its board of directors from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, provided, that such Rule will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rule would otherwise have under this Agreement; (ii) making any disclosure to SB’s shareholders if SB’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosures would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law; (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 7.3, or (iv) making any “stop, look, and listen” communication to SB’s shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to SB’s shareholders). 7.4 Consents of Regulatory Authorities. The Parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation and applications, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). The Parties agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. Each Party also shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Regulatory Authority or other Person whose Consent is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite Consent will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed. 7.5 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to take, and to cause its Subsidiaries to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to in Article 8; provided, that nothing herein shall preclude either Party from exercising its rights under this Agreement. 7.6 Investigation and Confidentiality. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall keep the other Party advised of all material developments relevant to its business and the consummation of the Merger and shall permit the other Party to make or cause to be made such investigation of its business and properties (including that of its Subsidiaries) and of their respective financial and legal conditions as the other Party reasonably requests, including, but not limited to, conducting any environmental assessment with respect to any property; provided, that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily or materially with normal operations, and that no environmental assessment by Buyer, or by consultants or other parties acting on Buyer’s behalf shall include the sampling of the soil, groundwater, surface water, indoor air, soil vapor or sub-slab vapor of a property without SB’s prior written permission. No investigation by a Party shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on the representations and warranties of the other Party. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, SB shall permit Buyer’s senior officers and independent auditors to meet with the senior officers of SB, including officers responsible for the SB Financial Statements and the internal controls of SB and SB’s independent public accountants, to discuss such matters as Buyer may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for Buyer to satisfy its obligations under Sections 302, 404, and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 


34 


(b) In addition to each Party’s obligations pursuant to Section 7.6(a), each Party shall, and shall cause its advisors and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries’ businesses, operations, and financial positions (“Confidential Information”) and shall not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and all work papers containing Confidential Information received from the other Party. (c) SB shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to exercise, and shall not waive any of, its Rights under, confidentiality agreements entered into with Persons which were considering an Acquisition Proposal with respect to SB to preserve the confidentiality of the information relating to SB Entities provided to such Persons and their Affiliates and Representatives. (d) Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice as soon as practicable after any determination by it of any fact or occurrence relating to the other Party which it has discovered through the course of its investigation and which represents, or is reasonably likely to represent, either a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other Party or which has had or is reasonably likely to have an SB Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.








________________


(e) Each Buyer Entity shall, in accordance with Buyer’s comprehensive written data security program established and maintained pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 6801 and regulations promulgated thereunder (“Buyer’s Security Program”), safeguard IIPI and Confidential Information disclosed to that Buyer Entity pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any Buyer Entity allows a third party to access such IIPI and Confidential Information, Buyer shall ensure that the third party safeguards that IIPI and Confidential Information in accordance with a data security program substantially equivalent to the Buyer’s Security Program. (f) Buyer shall notify SB promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) of any Data Incident. All Buyer Entities shall promptly take all actions that are necessary and advisable to correct, mitigate, and prevent recurrence of the Data Incident. All Buyer Entities shall cooperate fully with SB and its designees in all reasonable efforts to investigate the Data Incident. (g) If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Buyer Entity shall promptly return or dispose of, and certify the return or disposal, of all IIPI received by the Buyer Entity in connection with this Agreement. Any disposal of such IIPI must be performed in a manner that ensures that the IIPI is rendered permanently unreadable and unrecoverable. 7.7 Press Releases. Prior to the Effective Time, SB and Buyer shall consult with each other and agree as to the form and substance of any press release, communication with SB’s shareholders, or other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement, or any other transaction contemplated hereby; provided, that nothing in this Section 7.7 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such Party’s disclosure obligations imposed by Law. 7.8 Charter Provisions. Each SB Entity shall take all necessary action to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person under the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other governing instruments of any SB Entity or restrict or impair the ability of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a shareholder with respect to, shares of any SB Entity that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by them. 


35 


7.9 Employee Benefits and Contracts. (a) All Persons who are employees of SB Entities immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment is not terminated, if any, at or prior to the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) shall, at the Effective Time or the effective time of the Bank Merger, as applicable, become employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank, as applicable. Buyer and Buyer Bank shall honor all SB employment and change of control agreements existing as of the date of this Agreement that have been disclosed to Buyer, regardless of whether the employees with such agreements are Continuing Employees or receive new agreements with Buyer. All of the Continuing Employees shall be employed at will, and no contractual right with respect to employment shall inure to such employees because of this Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement. (b) As of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be employed on the same terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of Buyer Bank and eligible to participate in each of Buyer’s applicable Employee Benefit Plans with full credit for prior service with SB solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting. (c) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall make available employer-provided benefits under Buyer’s applicable Employee Benefit Plans to each Continuing Employee on the same basis as it provides such coverage to Buyer or Buyer Bank employees. With respect to Buyer’s Employee Benefit Plans providing health coverage, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period, or other limitations or exclusions otherwise applicable under such plans to new employees not to apply to a Continuing Employee or their covered dependents who were covered under a similar SB Benefit Plan at the Effective Time of the Merger. In addition, if any such transition occurs during the middle of a plan year, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such successor an Employee Benefit Plan of Buyer providing health coverage to give credit towards satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation and out-of-pocket maximum applied under such successor plan for any deductible, co-payment and other cost-sharing amounts previously paid by a Continuing Employee respecting his or her participation in the corresponding SB Benefit Plan during that plan year prior to the transition effective date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in lieu of the same, Buyer may continue SB’s health and other employee welfare benefit plans for each Continuing Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. (d) Upon not less than ten (10) days’ notice prior to the Closing Date from Buyer to SB, SB shall cause the termination, amendment, or other appropriate modification of each SB Benefit Plan as specified by Buyer in such notice such that no SB Entity shall sponsor or otherwise have any further Liability thereunder in connection with such applicable SB Benefit Plans, effective as of the date which immediately proceeds the Closing Date. Upon such action, participants in such applicable SB Benefit Plans that are described in ERISA Section 3(2) shall be 100% vested in their account balances. (e) Any Continuing Employees who are not parties to an employment, change in control, or other type of agreement that provides for severance or other compensation upon a change in control or upon a separation from service following a change in control, who remain employed by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, and whose employment is terminated by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall receive, subject to such Continuing Employee’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form satisfactory to Buyer, the following severance benefits: two (2) weeks of base salary for each twelve (12) months of such Continuing Employee’s prior employment with SB or any SB Subsidiary; provided, however, that in no event will the total amount of severance for any single Continuing Employee be less than four (4) weeks of such base salary or greater than twenty-six (26) weeks of such base salary. (f) No officer, employee, or other Person (other than the Parties to this Agreement) shall be deemed a third party or other beneficiary of this Section 7.9, and no such Person shall have any right or other entitlement to enforce any provision of this Agreement or seek any remedy in connection with this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 7.12. No provision of this Agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute, an Employee Benefit Plan or other arrangement, an amendment of any Employee Benefit Plan or other arrangement, or any provision of any Employee Benefit Plan or other arrangement. (g) SB shall take all appropriate action to terminate any SB Benefit Plan which provides for a “cash or deferred arrangement” pursuant to Code Section 401(k) (each, a “401(k) Plan”) prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that Buyer agrees that nothing in this Section 7.9 will require SB to cause the final dissolution and liquidation of, or to amend (other than as may be required to maintain such plan’s compliance with the Code, ERISA, or other applicable Law), said plan prior to the Closing Date.

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been fully paid. Section 3.03 No Further Ownership Rights.

If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III. Section 3.04  Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the former Company Shareholders on the date fifteen (15) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company Shareholder is entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of claims with respect thereto.

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the execution and delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article III. Section 3.07 Withholding of Tax.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent (each a “Payor”) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as the relevant Payor is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment to such Person under the Code or any other applicable provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent that doing so (i) would reasonably be likely to cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney work product protection, (ii) would constitute a violation of any applicable Law, (iii) would violate any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound or (iv) would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or would otherwise result in significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by their respective employees of their normal duties.  Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not risk waiver of such privilege, violate the applicable Law, Contract or interfere unreasonably. (b) Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Company Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold, and shall cause their respective Representatives to hold, all information received, directly or indirectly, from the Company or its Representatives in confidence in accordance with the Company Confidentiality Agreement.  Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall hold, and shall cause its respective Representatives to hold, all information received, directly or indirectly, from Parent or Merger Sub or their Representatives in confidence in accordance with the Parent Confidentiality Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto shall be entitled to respond to inquiries from Governmental Authorities related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Section 6.03.  The Confidentiality Agreements shall survive any termination of this Agreement; provided, however, to the extent of any conflict between the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern. Section 6.03 Reasonable Best Efforts to Consummate Merger; Regulatory Matters. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers from Governmental Authorities and making all necessary, proper or advisable registrations, filings and notices and taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain a consent, approval, authorization or waiver from any Governmental Authority (including under Insurance Laws and the HSR Act) and (ii) executing and delivering any additional agreements, documents or instruments necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions necessary to avoid each and every impediment under any applicable Law that may be asserted by, or Order that may be entered by, any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur, as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to take all actions requested by any Governmental Authority, or otherwise necessary, proper or advisable to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby and prevent the entry of any Order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby.

Parent and the Company shall promptly furnish to each other copies of all such filings and written materials after their filing or submission, in each case subject to applicable Laws.  Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority with respect to any consent, approval, authorization or waiver required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing each other copies of any written or electronic communication, and shall promptly advise each other when any such communication causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent, approval, authorization or waiver will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent, approval, authorization or waiver will be materially delayed or conditioned.  Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, permit any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, members, shareholders or any other Representatives to participate in any live or telephonic meeting (other than non-substantive scheduling or administrative calls) with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting.

Section 6.04  Proxy Statement.  As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof), the Company shall prepare and, after providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment and considering in good faith any comments provided by Parent, file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form.  Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and furnish all information concerning Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates that is required in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.  As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC or the staff of the SEC thereon and after the furnishing by the Company and Parent of all information required to be contained therein, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and the Company shall file any required amendments to the Proxy Statement with the SEC.  The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall consult with Parent regarding, and supply Parent with copies of, all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.  Prior to filing or mailing any proposed amendment of or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document and consider in good faith any comments provided by Parent.  If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

Subject to Section 6.06, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company Board of Directors shall recommend approval of this Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company Voting Shareholders (the “Company Recommendation”) and include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Voting Shareholders or, if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Company Common Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders Meeting.  In addition, the Company may and the Company shall, to the extent requested by Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting for a period or periods of up to thirty (30) days in the aggregate to permit additional time to solicit the Company Required Vote in the event that proxies constituting the Company Required Vote have not been received by the Company.

(a) The Company agrees that (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cause their officers and directors not to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause their employees not to, and direct their respective Representatives not to (and use reasonable best efforts to ensure that their respective Representatives not), directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal (other than contacting or engaging in discussions with the Person making a Takeover Proposal or its Representatives for the sole purpose of clarifying such Takeover Proposal), (B) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ confidential information with respect to, any Takeover Proposal, (C) enter into any Takeover Proposal Documentation with respect to a Takeover Proposal or (D) fail to enforce, or grant any waiver under, any standstill or similar agreement with any Person (unless, and only to the extent, the Company Board of Directors determines, after consultation with its outside counsel, that enforcement or failure to grant a waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties of directors under Indiana Law, in which case it may enable such Persons to confidentially submit a Takeover Proposal to the Company Board of Directors).  The Company shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all then existing discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted theretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and terminate all access to nonpublic information of the Company or its Subsidiaries that any such Person may have.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal received after the date of this Agreement that did not arise in whole or part due to a material breach of this Section 6.06, if the Company Board of Directors determines, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company may (and may authorize and permit its Subsidiaries and Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section 6.06(c) and only prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions no more favorable in the aggregate to such Person than those contained in the Company Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of a Takeover Proposal); provided that all material information provided to such Person has previously been provided or made available to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person (which nonpublic information shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be subject to the Company Confidentiality Agreement and may, in order to comply with applicable Law, be restricted to certain designated Representatives of Parent), and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. (b) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Recommendation or the approval, declaration of advisability or recommendation by the Company Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve, recommend the approval of, or publicly propose to approve or recommend the adoption of, any Takeover Proposal or enter into or publicly propose to enter into any Takeover Proposal Documentation, (iii) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days of a written request by Parent to make such public reaffirmation following the receipt by the Company of a public Takeover Proposal that has not been publicly withdrawn (other than in the case of a Takeover Proposal in the form of a tender offer or exchange offer, which shall be governed by clause (vi) below) (it being agreed that this clause (iii) shall not apply to any Takeover Proposal deemed to have been made pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stockholder Support and Contingent Sale Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2020, by and among certain of the Company’s shareholders and the other parties thereto absent subsequent action on or after the date of this Agreement by any party thereto that would constitute a Takeover Proposal); provided that Parent may make any such request only once in any ten (10) Business Day period, (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Law or takeover-related provision of the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company By-Laws inapplicable to a Takeover Proposal, (v) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (vi) fail to recommend against a tender offer or exchange offer prior to the earlier of (A) the tenth (10th) Business Day after commencement of the tender offer or exchange offer and (B) the later of the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting and the fifth (5th) Business Day after commencement of the tender offer or exchange offer (it being understood that any “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) (each of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi), an “Adverse Recommendation Change”). (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company Board of Directors may, if, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, it determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under Indiana Law, (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Change in Circumstance, (y) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or (z) cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a binding written definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal, if and only if:








________________


(i) the Company shall have given Parent notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change or causing or permitting the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (y) above, which notice shall include (A) the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board of Directors, the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal and copies of proposed definitive documentation with respect to the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that (1) any amendment to any financial terms or other terms that are material of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period prior to taking any specified action and (2) in determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause or permit the Company to so terminate this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the financial and other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing to the Company (and not revoked) in response to any such notice or otherwise within the periods described above) or (B) a reasonably detailed description of the material event or development constituting such Change in Circumstance; 


(ii) the Company has and has caused its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to make themselves reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during the period referred to in clause (i) above to the extent requested in writing by Parent in order to permit Parent to propose one or more amendments to this Agreement that would result in such Takeover Proposal ceasing to constitute a Superior Proposal or such other matter no longer constituting a Change in Circumstance; 


(iii) after considering any proposed binding offers to amend this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent (and not revoked) during the period referred to in clause (i) above, if any, the Company Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Superior Proposal or Change in Circumstance or cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under Indiana Law. 


(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.06(a), Section 6.06(b) and Section 6.06(c), the Company shall as promptly as practicable (in any event within thirty-six (36) hours) advise Parent of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal.  The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto). (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.06 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(c) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to Company Shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board of Directors determines (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of directors under Indiana Law or otherwise required under applicable Law, it being understood, however, that nothing in clause (i) or (ii) shall be deemed to alter the definition of an Adverse Recommendation Change as provided by Section 6.06(b) or permit the Company Board of Directors to make an Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by and in compliance with Section 6.06(b) and Section 6.06(c).

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.08(a), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided to, each Company Employee who incurs an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause during the Continuation Period with severance payments and benefits to which such Company Employee would have been entitled with respect to such termination under any Benefit Plan disclosed on Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter had such termination of employment occurred immediately prior to the Closing. (c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all obligations under the offer letters, employment agreements, severance agreements, non-competition agreements or other similar agreements listed on Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect as of the date of this Agreement or as they may be amended prior to the Effective Time to the extent permitted by this Agreement.  Nothing in this Section 6.08(c) shall be interpreted as limiting Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (as applicable) from exercising any and all rights reserved to the Company or its Subsidiaries under any such agreements or as requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue to employ any individual. (d) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under any employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries (exclusive of the Company and its Subsidiaries) solely to the extent such plans provide benefits to any Company Employee after the Closing Date (the “New Plans”), Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each such Company Employee to be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that the foregoing service credit shall not be required to apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.  In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, (x) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively- at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y) any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of- pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.08(a), in respect of the Company’s fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause to, honor and pay to each Company Employee an annual cash bonus (the “Annual Bonus”) payable pursuant to the Company Annual Incentive Plan disclosed on Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the “Company Incentive Plan”) no later than the time such Annual Bonus is due under the applicable Company Incentive Plans and prior to March 15 of the year following the year in which the Closing occurs (the “Payment Date”); provided that if the Company Employee incurs an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause prior to the Payment Date, such Company Employee’s Annual Bonus shall be pro-rated based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the Company Employee was employed with the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates during the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs and the denominator of which is 365. Parent shall, or shall cause to, operate the Company Incentive Plan and measure the level of performance achievement in a good faith manner consistent with the Company’s past practice. (f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as a “change in control,” “change of control,” or similar term of the Company under the terms of the Benefit Plans, as applicable. (g) The Company shall take, or cause its Subsidiaries to take, all actions necessary, including adopting written resolutions, to terminate, effective immediately before the Closing and contingent on the occurrence of the Closing, any Benefit Plan sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (a “Company 401(k) Plan”), and effective immediately prior to the Closing, (i) all participants in any Company 401(k) Plan shall be fully vested in their account balances and (ii) no employee or other Person shall have any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to such Company 401(k) Plan based upon compensation earned or services performed after the Closing.  The Company will provide Parent with a copy of such proposed resolutions terminating such Company 401(k) Plan prior to adoption thereof by the Company Board of Directors and shall thereafter deliver evidence to Parent that the Company Board of Directors approved such resolutions.  Parent shall designate or establish, or cause to be established, a defined contribution retirement plan of the Parent or one of its Affiliates that is intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the “Purchaser 401(k) Plan”) for which Company Employees shall become eligible to participate effective as of the Closing Date.  Parent shall take all reasonable steps necessary to cause such Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Company 401(k) Plan, including the in-kind rollover of any associated plan loans of each Company Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated and who elects such direct rollover in accordance with the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan and the Code.  The Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to take any and all commercially reasonable actions needed to permit each Company Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Company 401(k) Plan after the Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the promissory notes evidencing such loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, such as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans. (h) This Section 6.08 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.08 or any other provision of this Agreement or any other related Contract, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (iii) is intended to or shall confer upon any current or former director, employee or independent contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any other person any right, including any right to employment or continued employment or service for any period of time by reason of this Agreement or any other related agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

Section 6.09 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Indemnified Parties”) against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any actual or threatened Action or investigation, whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, relating to or in connection with any act or omission occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including relating to this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by the IBCL or any other applicable Law or provided under the Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company By-Laws in effect on the date hereof.  Parent hereby guarantees such performance by the Surviving Corporation. (b) From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Parties with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as those of such current insurance coverage with an insurance carrier with the same or better financial strength ratings as the Company’s current carriers; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the “Maximum Premium”); provided, further, that, if the annual premiums for such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; provided, further, however, that at the Company’s option in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6) year “tail” insurance policy that provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage described above; provided that the Company does not pay more than 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance policy. (c) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.  Further, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Parties than are presently set forth in the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company By-Laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, except as amendments may be required by the IBCL during such period. (d) This Section 6.09 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and their respective successors, heirs and representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended without the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, heirs and representatives). (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in Section 6.09.  In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.09.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.09 shall be in addition to, and not in substitute for, any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the articles of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. (g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any insurance policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.09 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any Action brought by any shareholder of the Company against the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation.

Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation.

In the event that any party hereto brings any Action to prevent a breach or breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, no party may allege or argue that there is an adequate remedy at law and each party hereto waives any defense or counterclaim in this regard.  The parties further agree that (a) by seeking any remedy provided for in this Section 9.10, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this Agreement and (b) nothing contained in this Section 9.10 shall require any party to institute any action for (or limit such party’s right to institute any action for) specific performance under this Section 9.10 before exercising any other right under this Agreement.

Section 9.11 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission) to the other parties. Section 9.12 Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by the Chosen Courts or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

The actions of an Eligible Person with respect to an employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be deemed to have been taken in what the Eligible Person reasonably believed to be the best interests of the Corporation or at least not opposed to its best interests if the Eligible Person reasonably believed he was acting in conformity with the requirements of such Act or he reasonably believed his actions to be in the interests of the participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. Section 2.  Definitions. (a) The term “Claim” as used in this Article V shall include every pending, threatened, or completed claim, action, suit, or proceeding and all appeals thereof (whether brought by or in the right of this Corporation or any other corporation or otherwise), civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, formal or informal, in which an Eligible Person may become involved, as a party or otherwise (i) by reason of his being or having been an Eligible Person, or (ii) by reason of any action taken or not taken by him in his capacity as an Eligible Person, whether or not he continued in such capacity at the time such Liability or Expense shall have been incurred. (b) The term “Eligible Person” as used in this Article V shall mean every person (and the estate, heirs, and personal representatives of such person) who is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation. (c) The terms “Liability” and “Expense” as used in this Article V shall include, but shall not be limited to, counsel fees and disbursements and amounts of judgments, fines, or penalties against (including excise taxes assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan), and amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of an Eligible Person. (d) The term “Wholly Successful” as used in this Article VI shall mean (i) termination of any claim against the Eligible Person in question without any finding of liability or guilt against him, (ii) approval by a court, with knowledge of the indemnity herein provided, of a settlement of any Claim, or (iii) the expiration of a reasonable period of time after the making or threatened making of any Claim without the institution of the same, without any payment or promise made to induce a settlement.

Section 3. Determination of Conduct. (a) Every Eligible Person claiming indemnification hereunder (other than one who has been Wholly Successful with respect to any Claim) shall be entitled to indemnification (i) if special independent legal counsel, which may be regular counsel of the Corporation, or other disinterested person or persons, in either case selected by the Board of Directors, whether or not a disinterested quorum exists (such counsel or person or persons being hereinafter called the “Referee”), shall deliver to the Corporation a written finding that such Eligible Person has met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 1(b) of Article V of these Bylaws, and (ii) if the Board of Directors, acting upon such written finding, so determines. The Board of Directors shall, if an Eligible Person is found to be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence, also determine the reasonableness of the Eligible Person’s Expenses. The Eligible Person claiming indemnification shall, if requested, appear before the Referee, answer questions that the Referee deems relevant and shall be given ample opportunity to present to the Referee evidence upon which the Eligible Person relies for indemnification. The Corporation shall, at the request of the Referee, make available facts, opinions, or other evidence in any way relevant to the Referee’s findings that are within the possession or control of the Corporation. (b) If an Eligible Person claiming indemnification pursuant to Section 3(a) of Article V of these Bylaws is found not to be entitled thereto, or if the Board of Directors fails to select a Referee under Section 3(a) of Article V of these Bylaws within a reasonable amount of time following a written request of an Eligible Person for the selection of a Referee, or if the Referee or the Board of Directors fails to make a determination under Section 3(a) of Article V of these Bylaws within a reasonable amount of time following the selection of a Referee, the Eligible Person may apply for indemnification with respect to a Claim to a court of competent jurisdiction, including a court in which the Claim is pending against the Eligible Person. On receipt of an application, the court, after giving notice to the Corporation and giving the Corporation ample opportunity to present to the court any information or evidence relating to the claim for indemnification that the Corporation deems appropriate, may order indemnification if it determines that the Eligible Person is entitled to indemnification with respect to the Claim because such Eligible Person met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 1(b) of Article V of these Bylaws. If the court determines that the Eligible Person is entitled to indemnification, the court shall also determine the reasonableness of the Eligible Person’s Expenses. 


Section 4.  Non-Exclusivity.  The rights of indemnification provided in Article V of these Bylaws shall be in addition to any rights to which any Eligible Person may otherwise be entitled. Irrespective of the provisions of Article V of these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may, at any time and from time to time, (a) approve indemnification of any Eligible Person to the full extent permitted by the provisions of applicable law at the time in effect, whether on account of past or future transactions, and (b) authorize the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Eligible Person against any Liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability. Section 5.  Advance Payment of Expenses.  Expenses incurred by an Eligible Person with respect to any Claim may be advanced by the Corporation (by action of the Board of Directors, whether or not a disinterested quorum exists) prior to the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Eligible Person to repay such amount unless he is determined to be entitled to indemnification. Section 6.  Miscellaneous. (a)  The provisions of Article V of these Bylaws shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Eligible Person, and an Eligible Person’s rights hereunder shall not be diminished or otherwise adversely affected by any repeal, amendment, or modification of Article V of these Bylaws that occurs subsequent to such person becoming an Eligible Person. (b)  The provisions of Article V of these Bylaws shall be applicable to Claims made or commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or after the adoption hereof.

Section 2.  Registration of Transfer.  Any certificate for shares of the Corporation shall be transferable in person or by attorney upon the surrender thereof to the Corporation or any transfer agent therefor (for the class of shares represented by the certificate surrendered) properly endorsed for transfer and accompanied by such assurances as the Corporation or such transfer agent may require as to the genuineness and effectiveness of each necessary endorsement. Section 3.  Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.  A new share certificate or certificates may be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation which is alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken upon (i) the execution and delivery to the Corporation by the person claiming the certificate to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken of an affidavit of that fact, specifying whether or not, at the time of such alleged loss, destruction or taking, the certificate was endorsed, and (ii) the furnishing to the Corporation of indemnity and other assurances, if any, satisfactory to the Corporation and to all transfer agents and registrars of the class of shares represented by the certificate against any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses or liabilities to which they or any of them may be subjected by reason of the issue and delivery of such new certificate or certificates or in respect of the original certificate. Section 4.  Registered Shareholders.  A person in whose name shares are of record on the books of the Corporation shall conclusively be deemed the unqualified owner and holder thereof for all purposes and to have capacity to exercise all rights of ownership.  Neither the Corporation nor any transfer agent of the Corporation shall be bound to recognize any equitable interest in or claim to such shares on the part of any other person, whether disclosed upon such certificate or otherwise, nor shall they be obliged to see to the execution of any trust or obligation.

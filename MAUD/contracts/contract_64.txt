  AGREEMENT   The Parties, intending to be legally bound, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, agree as follows:   Article I.   


DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION   Section 1.1               The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. By virtue of the Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”) and as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall be governed by and effected under the DGCL.   Section 1.2               Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the Certificate of Merger.   Section 1.3               Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place at the offices of Fenwick & West LLP, 801 California Street, Mountain View, California 94041 (or remotely via the electronic exchange of documents), as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than the third Business Day after the date on which all the conditions set forth in Article V are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if permitted hereunder) of such conditions at the Closing), or at such other location, date and time as agreed by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the “Closing Date.” Under the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger that the Parties shall agree satisfies the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the “Certificate of Merger”) shall be duly executed by the relevant Parties thereto and shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware concurrently with, or as soon as practicable following, the Closing, and the Parties shall make all other deliveries, filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the “Effective Time”).   Section 1.4               Governing Documents; Directors and Officers. Unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time:   (a)              the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit B;   (b)             the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to change the name of Merger Sub thereunder to be the name of the Surviving Corporation; and   (c)              the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.   Section 1.5               Conversion of Shares; Company Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Company ESPP.   (a)              At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any equityholder of the Company:   (i)               Treasury Shares. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or its wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties) shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion or payment of any property or consideration, and shall cease to exist;   


2   


  (ii)              Shares Owned by Parent and Merger Sub. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, immediately prior to the Effective








________________


Time, by (A) Parent, (B) Merger Sub, (C) any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or (D) any Person that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding stock of Merger Sub shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion or payment of any property or consideration, and shall cease to exist;   (iii)             All Other Shares. Each Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A)  Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(i) and Section 1.5(a)(ii) (collectively, the “Cancelled Shares”) and (B) Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount, net to the seller in cash, without interest, equal to $12.50 (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), subject to any required withholding of Taxes. All Shares that have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.5(a)(iii) shall be cancelled automatically and shall be extinguished and cease to exist, and the holders of (1) Shares represented by Company Stock Certificates (as defined below) or (2) Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to those Shares, other than the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.8.   (iv)              Company Options.   (A)              Vested Company Options. Each Company Option (or portion thereof and including any Company PSO after giving effect to the Performance Company Option Conversion set forth in Section 1.5(a)(iv)(C) below) that is vested, unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company Option”) shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Vested Company Option or any other Person, be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Vested Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such Vested Company Option, without interest and subject to any required withholding of Taxes. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts set forth in this Section 1.5(a)(iv)(A) as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than the later of the second regularly scheduled payroll date and the date that is 15 Business Days, in each case, after the Effective Time). If the applicable per share exercise price of any such Vested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Vested Company Option shall be cancelled pursuant to this Section 1.5(a)(iv)(A) without payment of any consideration.   (B)             Unvested Company Options. Each Company Option (or portion thereof and including any Company PSO after giving effect to the Performance Company Option Conversion set forth in Section 1.5(a)(iv)(C) below) held by a Continuing Employee that is unvested, unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time (each an “Unvested Company Option”) shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Unvested Company Option or any other Person, be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into a corresponding option denominated in shares of common stock of Parent and subject to terms and conditions substantially identical to those in effect at the Effective Time, including all vesting and applicable vesting acceleration provisions, except as such terms and conditions are modified by Section 1.5(a)(iv)(C) of this Agreement (each such assumed Unvested Company Option, an “Assumed Company Option”), except that (1) the number of shares of common stock of Parent that will be subject to each such Assumed Company Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of Shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole Share) and (2) the exercise or purchase price per share of each such Assumed Company Option shall equal (x) the per share exercise price of each such Assumed Company Option divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent); provided, however, that in no case shall the assumption of an Assumed Company Option be performed in a manner that is not in material compliance with the requirements of Sections 409A or 424(a) of the Code and other applicable Law. At the Effective Time, each Company Equity Plan pursuant to which any Assumed Company Option has been granted shall be assumed by Parent.   


3   


    (C)              Performance Company Option Conversion. The applicable performance metrics of each Company PSO (or portion thereof) that is unvested, unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time for which the Performance Period has not been completed as of the Effective Time will, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be deemed achieved at “target” and be converted to a time-based vesting schedule that corresponds to each Performance Period (the “Performance Company Option Conversion”). For the avoidance of doubt, for any Performance Period that has been completed as of the Agreement Date, but for which the performance achievement has not yet been determined as of the Agreement Date, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall determine the performance achievement and the resulting number of shares of Company Common Stock eligible to vest on the applicable vesting date prior the Effective Time in its sole discretion.   (v)                Company RSUs.   (A)              Vested Company RSUs. Each Company RSU (or portion thereof and including any Company PSU after giving effect to the Performance Company RSU Conversion set forth in Section 1.5(a)(v)(C) below) that is vested, unexpired, unsettled and outstanding as of the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company RSU”) shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Vested Company RSU or any other Person, be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any required withholding of Taxes. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts set forth in this Section 1.5(a) (v)(A) as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than the later of the second regularly scheduled payroll date and the date that is 15 Business Days, in each case, after the Effective Time).   (B)              Unvested Company RSUs. Each Company RSU (or portion thereof and including any Company PSU after giving effect to the Performance Company RSU Conversion set forth in Section 1.5(a)(v)(C) below) held by a Continuing Employee that is unvested, unexpired, unsettled and outstanding as of the Effective Time (each, an “Unvested Company RSU”) shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Company RSU or any other Person, be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into a corresponding restricted stock unit of Parent and subject to terms and conditions substantially identical to those in effect at the Effective Time, including all vesting and applicable vesting acceleration provisions, except as such terms and conditions are modified by Section 1.5(a)(v)(C) of this Agreement (each such assumed Unvested Company RSU, an “Assumed Company RSU”), except that the number of shares of common stock of Parent that will be subject to each such Assumed Company RSU shall be determined by multiplying the number of Shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company RSU by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole Share); provided, however, that in no case shall the assumption of an Assumed Company RSU be performed in a manner that is not in material compliance with the requirements of Sections 409A or 424(a) of the Code and other applicable Law. At the Effective Time, each Company Equity Plan pursuant to which any Assumed Company RSU has been granted shall be assumed by Parent.   


4   


  (C)              Performance Company RSU Conversion. The applicable performance metrics of each Company PSU (or portion thereof) that is unvested, unexpired, and outstanding for which the Performance Period has not been completed as of the Effective Time will, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be deemed achieved at “target” or the equivalent of “target” if such concept is not included in the applicable Company PSU, as








________________


determined by the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) utilizing the same methodology and standards used to calculate “target” for the other Company PSUs, and be converted to a time-based vesting schedule that corresponds to each Performance Period (the “Performance Company RSU Conversion”). For the avoidance of doubt, for any Performance Period that has been completed as of the Agreement Date, but for which the performance achievement has not yet been determined as of the Agreement Date, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall determine the performance achievement and the resulting number of shares of Company Common Stock eligible to vest on the applicable vesting date prior the Effective Time in its sole discretion.   (vi)              Company ESPP. As soon as practicable following the Agreement Date, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that: (A) with respect to each “Offering Period” (as defined in the Company ESPP), (1) no participant may elect to participate in the Company ESPP after the Agreement Date and (2) no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on the Agreement Date for the Offering Period, (B) the Offering Period shall terminate at the earlier of (1) the next currently scheduled purchase date for such Offering Period and (2) the date that is no later than two Business Days immediately preceding the Effective Time, and, subject to the consummation of the Merger, be the final Offering Period under the Company ESPP, (C) each participant’s accumulated payroll deduction shall be used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP on the earlier of (1) the next currently scheduled purchase date for such Offering Period and (2) the date that is no later than two Business Days prior to the Effective Time (and all participant contributions then in the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase Shares on such date in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP as if such date was the last date of such Offering Period); and (D) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of stock in the Company ESPP, all Shares purchased under the Company ESPP shall be treated identically to all other Shares in the Merger and the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration therefor in accordance with this Section 1.5.   (vii)            Merger Sub. Each share of the common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (viii)          Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the administrator of the Company Equity Plans shall take any and all actions as are reasonably necessary to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.5.   (b)               If, during the period from the Agreement Date through the Effective Time, any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction occurs with respect to the outstanding Shares, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then all calculations provided for that are based on a number of shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, including the Per Share Merger Consideration, shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   


5   


  Section 1.6              Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, (a) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, extinguished and cease to exist and (b) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such holder’s right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 1.8(g). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in any event within one Business Day) of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time (unless required by applicable Law), the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal, or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to pay for Shares that have become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.   Section 1.7               Closing of the Company’s Transfer Books . At the Effective Time: (a) all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist in exchange for the consideration issued pursuant to Section 1.5, and all holders of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as Company Stockholders except as provided for in Section 1.5 and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such Shares shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Stock Certificate”) is presented to the Paying Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8.   Section 1.8               Exchange of Certificates.   (a)              On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select American Stock Transfer & Trust Company or such other reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the “Paying Agent” ) and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii). The cash amounts so deposited with the Paying Agent are referred to collectively as the “Exchange Fund.”   


6   


  (b)              As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than three Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Stock Certificate or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book- Entry Shares”), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:   (i)                a letter of transmittal, which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares, as the

case may be, to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent, the Company and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree, acting reasonably; and   (ii)               instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration.   (c)              Upon the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form in accordance with the instructions thereto, and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent, with respect to such Company Stock Certificates or an agent’s message in the case of a book entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Company Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Company Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and shall be accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered or transferred (as applicable) as contemplated hereby, each Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share in respect of Shares converted into the right to receive Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) shall be deemed, from and at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement.   (d)              The Per Share Merger Consideration paid and issued upon the surrender or transfer (as applicable) of any Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.8 shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Company Stock Certificate, the Shares formerly represented by it.   


7   


  (e)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.8, if any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (including if reasonably required by the Paying Agent) the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 1.8(h), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5.   (f)                 Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Shares as of the one year anniversary of the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (g)                Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and any of their agents or Affiliates, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   (h)              Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Shares or to any other Person with respect to any cash amounts properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.   Section 1.9               Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to adopt or authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the DGCL. This Agreement has been validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally, and general equitable principles. The Company Board at a meeting duly called and held has unanimously adopted resolutions that: (i) determined that each of the Transactions, individually and in the aggregate, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions (including the execution, delivery and performance thereof) and declared it advisable that the Company enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions in accordance with the DGCL and (iii) recommended that the Company’s stockholders adopt this Agreement (it being understood that nothing in this clause (iii) shall in any way limit the Company Board’s rights under Section 4.4).   (b)              Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 3.9(b), the Company Board has taken all appropriate actions so that the restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply with respect to, or as a result of, the execution of this Agreement or the Voting Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, without any further action on the part of the Company Stockholders or the Company Board. No other “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “business combination” or other anti-takeover statute or Law (each, together with Section 203 of the DGCL, a “Takeover Law”) is applicable to the Company, the Transactions or the Voting Agreement. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has adopted a stockholder rights agreement, rights plan, “poison pill” or other similar agreement that is currently in effect.   (c)              Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 3.9(b), the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote thereon in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting (the “Company Stockholder Approval”) is the only vote of the holders of Shares or any other class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary (under applicable Law, the Company’s governing documents or otherwise) to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Transactions.   Section 2.4               Governmental Approvals and Consents; Non-Contravention.

11   


  (b)                The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions does not and will not (i) violate, contravene or conflict with any provision of the Company Organizational Documents, (ii) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute any default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or result in the creation of any Lien (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or a loss of a benefit under, or require that any Consent be obtained with respect to, any Company Material Contracts or (iii) assuming compliance with the matters described in Section 2.4(a)(i)-(iv), violate, conflict with or result in any breach under any provision of any Law applicable to the Company or Company Assets, except, in the cases of subclauses (ii) and (iii), where such violation, breach, conflict, default, right of termination or cancellation, acceleration, loss of benefit or failure to obtain such Consent would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 2.5               Compliance with Laws; Governmental Authorizations.   (a)                The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and, for the three years immediately preceding the Agreement Date, has been, in compliance with or not in violation of, the Laws applicable to each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions, in each case except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Within the three-year period immediately preceding the Agreement Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notices of violation or non-compliance with respect to any Laws (including Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions) applicable to it or any Company Assets, in each case other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b)                Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective directors or officers nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any employees, agents, representatives, consultants, partners, licensors and subcontractors or any other Person acting on their behalf, has, directly or indirectly, (i) made, promised, offered or authorized (A) any unlawful payment or the unlawful transfer of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any government official, employee or agent, political party or any official of such party, or political candidate or (B) any unlawful bribe, rebate, influence payment, kickback or similar unlawful payment or (ii) violated any Anti-Corruption Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have instituted policies and procedures that are designed to reasonably ensure compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws.   (c)                The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all Governmental Authorizations necessary to conduct their respective businesses as presently conducted or to own, lease and operate its Company Assets, except where the failure to have any such Governmental Authorizations would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Within the three-year period immediately preceding the Agreement Date, the Company has not received any written notice from any Governmental Authority regarding (i) any actual or possible material violation of any Governmental Authorization, or any failure to comply in any respect with any term or requirement of any Governmental Authorization or (ii) any actual or possible revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or modification of any Governmental Authorization, in each case other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries comply with the terms of all Governmental Authorizations, and no revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation or adverse modification of any of the Governmental Authorizations is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice in the three year period prior to the Agreement Date from any Governmental Authority threatening to revoke, withdraw, suspend, cancel or modify any Governmental Authorization, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Governmental Authorization is in full force and effect, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has executed a written consent, effective immediately following the execution of this Agreement, adopting this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the other Transaction Documents to which either is a party, the performance of Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, including the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to adopt or authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as Merger Sub’s sole stockholder, and the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally, and general equitable principles.

  (b)               Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall, and shall cause the Parent Representatives or Company Representatives, as applicable, to keep all information received pursuant to this Section 4.2 or otherwise in connection with the Transactions (including information received prior to the Agreement Date) confidential to the extent such information would constitute Confidential Information as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, and use such information solely in connection with the implementation of the Transactions or as otherwise permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and the Parent Representatives or Company Representatives, as applicable, shall be permitted to disclose all or any part of such information as may be required by applicable Law, by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Authority, as determined in good faith by the Party making such disclosure; provided that except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a requirement or obligation reasonably in advance of such disclosure.   Section 4.3               Company Stockholder Approval.   (a)               Proxy Statement and Other SEC Filings.   (i)                 Promptly (and in no event not more than 30 days) following the Agreement Date, (A) the Company will prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the “Proxy Statement”) relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (B) Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company all information concerning themselves and their Affiliates that is reasonably required to be included in the Proxy Statement and shall provide such other assistance in the preparation of the Proxy Statement as may be reasonably requested by the Company from time to time. Subject to Section 4.4, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments or revisions made by Parent and its counsel thereon.   (ii)               If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an “Other Required Company Filing”), then the Company shall promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any Other Required Company Filing (or any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments or revisions made by Parent and its counsel thereon.

If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should (in the good faith judgment of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand) be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.3, except in connection with a Change of Board Recommendation in accordance with Section 4.4, or as required by applicable Law or the SEC or its

staff (as determined in good faith by the Company Board after consulting with outside legal counsel), no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or to an Other Required Company Filing shall be made by the Company without the approval of Parent, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.   (iv)              The Company and its Subsidiaries, will not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written communication and shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments or revisions made by such Parent and its counsel.   (v)                The Company will advise Parent promptly after the Company receives notice of (A) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for any amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, (B) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, or (C) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection therewith.   (vi)              Subject to applicable Law, the Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders no later than the fifth Business Day following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement, which confirmation will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not notified the Company prior to the end of the 10th calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement.

  (b)                Company Stockholder Meeting.   (i)                 The Company, acting through the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof), shall promptly following receipt of confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement (which confirmation will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company prior to the end of the 10th calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement), take all action required under the DGCL, the Company Organizational Documents and the applicable requirements of the Nasdaq necessary to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Company Stockholder Meeting”), with such record date being selected after reasonable consultation with Parent and such meeting date being held no later than 45 days after the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 4.3(a)(vi) (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company, after consultation with Parent, from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if on one or more occasions (A) there are holders of insufficient Shares present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal counsel that it is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, Order or a request from the SEC or its staff, (C) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or (D) any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors has been discovered by the Company or Parent, and the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that such information is required under applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, such that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not false or misleading, in order to correct such information and file an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC; provided that, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company Stockholder Meeting will not be postponed or adjourned by more than 10 Business Days at a time.   (ii)               The Company shall solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and, unless the Company Board has effected a Change of Board Recommendation in accordance with Section 4.4, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VI, the Company shall take all action required under the DGCL, the Company Organizational Documents and the applicable requirements of the Nasdaq necessary to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, whether or not the Company Board at any time subsequent to the Agreement Date shall have effected a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise shall have determined that this Agreement is no longer advisable.   Section 4.4               No Solicitation of Transactions.   (a)                Subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.4, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees, and shall direct and cause its other Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and shall immediately terminate access of such Persons to any electronic datarooms maintained by the Company. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days of the Agreement Date) deliver a written notice to each such Person to the effect that the Company is ending all such solicitations, communications, activities, discussions or negotiations with such Person, effective on the Agreement Date, which written notice shall also instruct each Person to promptly return or destroy all non-public information previously furnished to such Person or any Company Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation or breach of the restrictions or obligations set forth in this Section 4.4 by any Subsidiary of the Company or any Company Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries acting on behalf of or at the direction of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of Section 4.4 by the Company.   


38    


  (b)              Except as permitted by this Section 4.4, prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and the Company shall direct and cause Company Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:   (i)                 initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of providing information) the making, submission or

(c)                Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time following the Agreement Date and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of the terms of this Section 4.4 (a “Qualifying Acquisition Proposal”) that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with one or more of its financial advisors and with its outside legal counsel) that such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take the action described in clause (i) or (ii) below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law, the Company and the Company Representatives shall be permitted to (i) furnish to the Person that has made the Qualifying Acquisition Proposal (and such Person’s representatives) information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, provided that the Company shall substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company that is provided to (or given access to) any Person which was not previously provided or made available to Parent and (ii) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person (or such Person’s representatives) that has made the Qualifying Acquisition Proposal; provided that prior to or concurrently with the Company first taking such actions with respect to a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal as described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such determination of the Company Board as provided for in this Section 4.4(c).   


39    


  (d)                The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) (i) provide Parent written notice of the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Inquiries or Acquisition Proposals and (ii) disclose to Parent the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the party making such inquiry or proposal a copy of all documents (if in writing) or a written summary of material terms (if oral) with respect to such Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, provision or occurrence (as practicable)) of any material developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (and any subsequent amendments or modifications thereto) including any change in the material terms and conditions thereof. The Company shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, and in any event within 24 hours following a determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such determination.   (e)                Except as permitted by Section 4.4(f), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) shall not (i) (1) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (2) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (3) approve, adopt, endorse, or recommend to the Company Stockholders, or publicly propose to approve, adopt, endorse, declare advisable or recommend to the Company Stockholders, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (or the approval or adoption thereof), (4) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a written request by Parent following an Acquisition Proposal (provided that Parent may only make such request once with respect to any Acquisition Proposal that has not been amended with respect to financial or other material terms) (other than of the type referred to in the following clause (5)) (or material modification thereto) becoming publicly known or (5) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within ten Business Days after commencement of such Acquisition Proposal or if the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held within ten (10) Business Days from the date of such public disclosure or commencement, as applicable, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation promptly and in any event prior to the date which is two (2) Business Days before the date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held or (ii) approve, recommend, authorize, cause, permit, resolve to allow, or publicly announce an intention to approve or recommend that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (actions prohibited by this Section 4.4(e) being referred to as a “Change of Board Recommendation”).   (f)                 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.4, (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal and/or (y) validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(e), if (i) the Company receives a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with one or more of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(e) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; provided that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

  (g)                Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and subject to the other provisions of this Section 4.4, the Company Board may effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with one or more of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that its failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; provided that the Company Board may not effect such Change of Board Recommendation unless:   (i)                 the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the “Intervening Event Notice Period”), of its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), which notice shall specify the details of such Intervening Event and the basis upon which the Company Board intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation;   (ii)               if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with, and shall have caused the Company Representatives to negotiate with, Parent in good faith during the Intervening Event Notice Period in order to enable Parent to modify the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would eliminate the need for taking such action as determined by the Company Board in good faith (after consultation with one or more of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel); and   (iii)             following the Company’s and the Company’s Representatives’ negotiation in good faith with Parent, to the extent such negotiation is requested by Parent, during the Intervening Event Notice Period and after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendment or modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any, the Company Board (after consultation with one or more of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) shall have determined in good faith that the failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation in connection therewith would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law.   (h)                Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9, Item 1012 of Regulation M-A or otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012 under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with applicable Law, provided that no Change of Board Recommendation shall be made unless the Company shall have first complied in all material respects with its obligations under the other provisions of this Section 4.4. In addition, none of the following shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation: (i) a “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (provided that the Company has not withdrawn, changed, amended, modified or qualified the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub in such communication), and/or (ii) any statement that includes an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal and an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation. In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from making any other disclosure to the Company Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law, provided that any such disclosure that would otherwise constitute a Change of Board Recommendation (after giving effect to the immediately preceding sentence) shall be made only in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 4.4.   (i)                 No Change of Board Recommendation shall change (or be deemed to change) the approval of the Transactions by the Company Board for purposes of any Takeover Law (or the applicability of any Takeover Law to the Transactions). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any action that may be taken by, and all obligations and duties of, the Company Board under this Section 4.4 may also be taken by and shall bind a duly constituted committee thereof.

  Section 4.5               Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.   (a)                Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consents of third parties with

respect to any Company Material Contracts as may be necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the Transactions or required by the terms of any such Company Material Contract as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of the Transactions; in each case to the extent reasonably requested in writing by Parent, including without limitation the Consents set forth on Section 4.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to which the Company shall consult and cooperate with Parent in obtaining. In the event that such third-party Consent described in this Section 4.5(a) shall not be obtained, the Company and Parent shall determine reasonably and jointly whether to take any further actions with respect to such Company Material Contracts; provided that without its consent (such consent to be given or withheld in its sole discretion), the Company shall not be required to pay any amount or change Contract terms or its business practices in order to obtain any such Consent (except to the extent that such payment or change is contingent on consummation of the Transactions). Except as set forth in Section 5.1, in no event shall the receipt of third-party Consents, if any, be a condition to the consummation of the Merger.   (b)                Subject to Section 4.5(c) and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent agree, and Parent and the Company each agree to cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Transactions and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to each Party’s obligation to consummate the Transactions as set forth in Section 5.1 to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the Outside Date), including taking all actions necessary (i) to obtain all Governmental Authorizations required for the consummation of the Merger, (ii) to effect all such necessary registrations and filings with the Governmental Authorities in order to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other Transactions, (iii) to comply with all requirements under applicable Law that may be imposed on it with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and (iv) to avoid a Proceeding by any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions or to defend or contest any Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, brought under, pursuant to or relating to any regulatory Law challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other to the extent necessary in connection with the foregoing.   (c)                In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 4.5(b) and without limiting the generality of the undertaking pursuant thereto, Parent and the Company shall promptly make all filings that may be required for the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 5.1(c)(i) by each of them in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, which, in any event, shall be made within 10 Business Days following the Agreement Date with respect to the initial filings required under the HSR Act. In addition, Parent and the Company agree, and shall each cause each of its Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their reasonable best efforts and take all actions necessary to obtain any Governmental Authorizations required for the consummation of the Merger as contemplated by Section 4.5(b) above as promptly as possible, including to make all other necessary filings, notifications or registrations within 15 Business Days of the Agreement Date to obtain all Governmental Authorizations set forth on Section 5.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, to respond as promptly as practicable to any requests for information from any Governmental Authority and otherwise comply with any inquiry or request from any Governmental Authority as promptly as practicable (and in each case any such information shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws), and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an “Antitrust Order”) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Each Party shall furnish to the other such necessary information and assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or submissions by it to any Governmental Authority. Neither Party shall give Consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or withdraw its notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other filing made pursuant to any Antitrust Law or other regulatory Law unless the other Party has given its prior written Consent to such extension or delay (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).   


43    


  (d)                Parent and the Company will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with Proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, the Parties agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) give each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications with any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws, (iv) if any Governmental Authority initiates a substantive oral communication regarding any Antitrust Laws, to promptly notify the other Party of the substance of such communication, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon all substantive written communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) with a Governmental Authority regarding any Antitrust Laws and (vi) provide each other with copies of all substantive written communications from any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any disclosures or provision of copies by one Party to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis, if appropriate.   (e)                Each of Parent and the Company shall notify and keep the other advised as to (i) any material communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the Transactions and (ii) any litigation or administrative Proceeding pending and known to such Party, or to its knowledge threatened, that challenges, or would challenge, the Transactions. The Company and Parent shall not take any action inconsistent with their obligations under this Agreement or, without prejudice to the Company’s or Parent’s rights under this Agreement, that would materially hinder or delay the consummation of the Transactions.   (f)                 If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the Transactions as violating any Antitrust Law or if a filing pursuant to Section 4.5(b) is reasonably likely to be rejected or conditioned by a Governmental Authority, then each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections or challenges as such Governmental Authority or other Person may have to such transactions so as to permit consummation of the Transactions as soon as practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable best efforts, and promptly take any and all steps necessary, to avoid or eliminate any concerns on the part of, or to satisfy any conditions imposed by, any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law or any other Person so as to enable the Parties to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date; provided that, in no event will Parent or its Subsidiaries be obligated to (i) propose, negotiate, offer or commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, now owned or hereafter sought to be acquired, (ii) terminate or amend any existing relationships or contractual rights or obligations or (iii) offer or commit to take any action that would limit or modify Parent’s rights of ownership in, or ability to conduct the business of, any of its operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or assets, including, after the Closing, the business of the Company, if any such foregoing action, in each of (i)- (iii), (A) would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (1) materially reduce the reasonably anticipated benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) adversely impact Parent or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries other than, after the Closing, the Company and the Company’s Subsidiaries or (3) impact the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries in a manner that is material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) is not contingent on the consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party shall keep the other Party informed of all material matters, discussions and activities relating to any of the matters contemplated by this Section 4.5(f).    (g)                Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not make an initial filing under the HSR Act with respect to any transaction other than the Transactions prior to the initial filing with respect to the Transactions to be made under the HSR Act pursuant to Section 4.5(c).   (h)                No action by the Company taken in compliance with Section 4.4 will be considered a violation of this Section 4.5.

  Section 4.6                Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will consult with each other and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or public announcement relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall not, and shall not permit their Affiliates to, issue any such press release or public announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Authority, as determined in good faith by the Party making such public announcement or issuing such press release. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the initial press release announcing the Transactions and the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release in the form heretofore agreed to by the Company and Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.6, (i) each of the Parties may issue press releases or public announcements concerning the Transactions that are not materially inconsistent with previous press releases or public announcements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this Section 4.6 and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the other parties, the Merger or the other Transactions, (ii) each of the Parties, their Affiliates, the Company Representatives and the Parent Representatives may make public statements in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not materially inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this Section 4.6 and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the other parties, the Merger or the other Transactions, (iii) the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.6 shall not apply to any press release or public announcement issued or proposed to be issued in connection with, or in response to, an Acquisition Proposal, Intervening Event, Superior Proposal or a Change of Board Recommendation but in each case such release or announcement shall be subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 4.4. To the extent that any provision of the Confidentiality Agreement is in conflict with this Section 4.6, such provision shall be deemed amended and superseded by this Section 4.6, mutatis mutandis, and in addition the restrictions thereunder with respect to “Transaction Information” as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement and the restrictions contained in Section 11 of the Confidentiality Agreement will, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, terminate and be of no further force and effect.   Section 4.7                Employee Benefit Matters.   (a)               With respect to any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Employees”) will participate effective as of or after the Effective Time (collectively, “New Plans”), subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is reflected in the books and records of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting, eligibility and level of benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance) in any New Plan in which such Company Employees will be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to the extent that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent any Company Employee participates in a New Plan that is a welfare plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a “Parent Welfare Plan”), Parent and any of its Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and any insurer, third party administrator or service provider under the applicable Parent Welfare Plan, to cause all (i) pre-existing condition limitations which otherwise would be applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents to be waived to the extent satisfied under a Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employee’s commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan, (ii) participation waiting periods under each Parent Welfare Plan that would otherwise be applicable to such Company Employee to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employee’s commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan and (iii) co-payments and deductibles paid by Company Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be credited for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket requirement under any such Parent Welfare Plan.   (b)                For any Company Employee that, as of the Effective Time, remains an employee of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (each a “Continuing Employee”), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for a period of 12 months following the Effective Time, provide for (i) at least the same level of base salary or base hourly wage, as applicable, that was provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)  a target cash bonus percentage as provided on Section 4.7(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (iii) employee benefits (other than equity-based awards, profit sharing plans, other incentive plans and defined benefit or non-qualified arrangements) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits (other than equity-based awards, profit sharing plans, other incentive plans and defined benefit or non-qualified arrangements) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and (iv) and upon a termination without cause of a Continuing Employee, the severance benefits set forth on Section 4.7(b)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Letter applicable to such Continuing Employee.   


45    


  (c)                In addition to the foregoing, the Company and Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent shall use reasonable best efforts and take any action that is mutually determined in good faith to be reasonably necessary to mitigate and/or minimize the impact of the tax consequences of Section 280G of the Code (including as a result of the Transactions under all employment, severance and termination agreements, other compensation arrangements and Company Benefit Plans) on any individual that is regarded as a “disqualified individual” (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1), provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent shall provide any indemnity or gross-up obligation for any excise taxes or penalties imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any corresponding provisions of foreign, state or local Law relating to Tax).   (d)                Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall (x) take such actions and adopt such necessary resolutions to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the Closing Date, the 401(k) plan of the Company (the “401(k) Plan”) and/or (y) take such actions as Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect such actions relating to any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate. If Parent requests that the Company terminate the 401(k) Plan, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent an executed copy of the resolutions adopted by the board of directors of the 401(k) Plan sponsor (or appropriate governing body) terminating the 401(k) Plan. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to Parent’s review and approval prior to adoption, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Prior to the effective date of the termination of the 401(k) Plan, the Company shall take any and all actions as may be reasonably required, including amending to the 401(k) Plan and/or the 401(k) Plan’s policies and procedures, for the 401(k) Plan to permit each 401(k) Plan participant who has a loan outstanding at the Closing Date to make arrangements to continue to repay such loan in accordance with the original amortization schedule until such time as the participant’s account balance is distributed.   (e)              Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions (including obtaining consent from participants, if required) and adopt such necessary resolutions to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the Closing Date, each Company Benefit Plan set forth on Section 4.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(f)               This Section 4.7 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 4.7, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 4.7. Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 4.7 or (iii) require Parent or any of its Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular Company Employee or continue any particular Company Benefit Plan or New Plan.

  (g)              Following the Agreement Date, each of Parent and the Company (and their respective Affiliates) will use reasonable best efforts in all matters necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 4.7 and the requirements of any applicable Law and will provide, and will cause each of their respective representatives, including legal, human resources and regulatory compliance personnel, to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by the other Party in that regard, including, (i) cooperating and providing each other with all necessary and reasonable assistance and information to ensure that any works councils or committees, trade unions and/or employee representatives applicable to the Continuing Employees are provided with the information required in order for proper consultation, notification and other required processes under applicable Law to take place, and (ii) exchanging information and data, including reports prepared in connection with bonus plan participation and related data of Continuing Employees, relating to workers’ compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages, including information and data that are necessary to support or perform any compensation consultant process or that is otherwise reasonably requested in connection with any compensation consultant process (in each case, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law or to the extent that such information and data relates to performance ratings or assessments of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries), making any and all required filings and notices, making any and all required communications with Company Employees and obtaining any Governmental Authorizations required hereunder. Such cooperation will include the provision of any information and consultation required by applicable Law, the terms of any Contract, or as reasonably requested by the other Party. Each of Parent and the Company will make available its representatives at such times and in such places as the other Party may reasonably request for purposes of discussions with representatives of any such works council, economic committee, union or similar body.   Section 4.8               S-8 Filing. Parent shall (i) file with the SEC, no later than one Business Day after the Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) relating to the shares of Parent common stock issuable with respect to the Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company RSUs in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iv)(B) and Section 1.5(a)(v)(B), (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company RSUs remain outstanding, and (iii) deliver to each holder of an Assumed Company Option and Assumed Company RSU an appropriate notice setting forth such holder’s rights pursuant to such Assumed Company Option and Assumed Company RSU.   Section 4.9               Indemnification of Directors and Officers.   (a)                For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective present or former directors and officers (in each case, solely to the extent acting in such capacity) (each an “Indemnified Person,” and collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) against all reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any pending or threatened Proceeding (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in each case solely to the extent arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer or director occurring before the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under applicable Law. To the fullest extent the Company would have been permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses) of each Indemnified Person in the defense of any Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding, subject to receipt from the Indemnified Person to whom such expenses are advanced of an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event any Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Person and in which indemnification is sought by such Indemnified Person under this Section 4.9(a), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the obligation, to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain separate counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such Proceeding, (iii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Proceeding, unless such settlement, compromise or consent relates only to monetary damages or includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents thereto and (iv) the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such matter. The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 4.9 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, and any indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time (collectively, the “D&O Indemnification Agreements”) and shall not limit or modify any rights of any Indemnified Person pursuant to any D&O Indemnification Agreements.   


47    


  (b)                For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless (including advancement of expenses) all Indemnified Persons to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the Agreement Date by the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws and the applicable D&O Indemnification Agreements, arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.   (c)                For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than were set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws prior to the Effective Time. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the D&O Indemnification Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.   (d)                Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall bind and purchase directors and officers runoff insurance coverage (the “D&O Runoff Insurance”), which by its terms shall survive the Merger for not less than six years for the benefit of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Company’s and any of its Subsidiary’s past and present directors and/or officers that are insured under the Company’s current directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the Agreement Date. The D&O Runoff Insurance shall provide coverage for the Company, its Subsidiaries and such persons in their capacity as directors and/or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time that is not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company’s existing directors and officers policy (true and complete copies of which have been made available to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage for up to the Maximum Amount. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the D&O Runoff Insurance in full force and effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a period of six years after the Effective Time or, if such policies are terminated or cancelled, obtain (subject to the limitations

set forth in the next sentence) alternative D&O Runoff Insurance on substantially similar terms as set forth in this Section 4.9(d). The Company shall not, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for the D&O Runoff Insurance in excess of 300% (the “Maximum Amount”) of the last annual premium paid prior to the Agreement Date (it being understood and agreed that in the event the cost of such D&O Runoff Insurance exceeds the Maximum Amount, in the aggregate, the Company shall remain obligated to provide, and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the broadest D&O Runoff Insurance coverage as may be obtained for an aggregate premium equal to the Maximum Amount).

  Section 7.4               Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.   Section 7.5               Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the exhibits hereto and the Company Disclosure Letter), the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damage.

Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 7.7, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (i) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand and (ii) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, pursuant to this Agreement.

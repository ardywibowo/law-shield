AGREEMENT 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I THE MERGER 


Section 1.1          The Merger. 


(a)          Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of such conditions at the Closing), at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”) as a wholly owned indirect Subsidiary of Parent. 


(b)          The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the “Closing”) to be held remotely via electronic transmission of related documentation or similar means, on a date and at a time to be agreed upon by Parent and the Company, which date shall be no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of such conditions at the Closing), or at such other location, date and time as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree upon in writing.  The date upon which the Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the “Closing Date.” 


(c)          At the Closing, the Company shall file a certificate of merger in requisite and customary form and substance with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger.  The Merger shall become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be mutually agreed to by the parties and as specified in the certificate of merger) (the time as of which the Merger becomes effective, the “Effective Time”). 


(d)          From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the DGCL. 


Section 1.2          Conversion of Shares of Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, any holder of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary or Parent: 


(a)          except as otherwise provided in Section 1.2(b), Section 1.2(c) or Section 1.4, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive $9.50 in cash, without interest (such amount, as may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.10, the “Common Stock Merger Consideration”), and each holder of any such share of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.3; 


2








________________


(b)          each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock, and share of Company Common Stock owned by a wholly-owned Company Subsidiary or by Parent or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; 


(c)          each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and 


(d)          each share of Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Convertible Preferred Liquidation Amount (the “Preferred Stock Merger Consideration” and, collectively with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company Stock Appreciation Right Consideration and Company Equity Appreciation Right Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). 


Section 1.3          Surrender and Payment. 


(a)          Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.2(a).  Parent shall provide (or shall cause to be provided) to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of (i) the certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Certificates”) and (ii) the uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”) (but not any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company Stock Appreciation Right Consideration, the Company Equity Appreciation Right Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration) (such cash, the “Exchange Fund”).  If, for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (excluding any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company Stock Appreciation Right Consideration, the Company Equity Appreciation Right Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to pay all such amounts, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof.  All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall only be used for the purposes provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent before the Effective Time.  Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent) a letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

________________


(b)          Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share.  Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.  No interest or dividends will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. 


(c)          I f any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay in advance to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 


(d)          After the Effective Time, the transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article I. 


(e)          Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f)          The agreement with the Exchange Agent shall provide that the Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided, that (i) no such investment (including any losses thereon) shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Article I, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) all such investments shall be in (w) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (x) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (y) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services or (z) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent. 


(g)          Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 


Section 1.4          Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with Section 1.2(b) or converted in accordance with Section 1.2(c)) and shares of Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, but instead, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.2(a) or Section 1.2(d), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be, in compliance with Section 1.3.  The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under the DGCL consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder.  Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.  From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.

(b)          Neither Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume any Company Stock Appreciation Rights or Company Equity Appreciation Rights, or substitute for any Company Stock Appreciation Rights or Company Equity Appreciation Rights any stock appreciation right for Surviving Corporation or Parent stock, in connection with the Merger or any of the Transactions.  As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Stock Appreciation Rights or Company Equity Appreciation Rights, (i) all Unvested Company Stock Appreciation Rights and Unvested Company Equity Appreciation Rights (whether time and/or performance-based) which are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become exercisable, and become Vested Company Stock Appreciation Rights and Vested Company Equity Appreciation Rights, (ii) to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Appreciation Right, including each formerly Unvested Company Stock Appreciation Right, shall be canceled at the Effective Time, with the former holder of such canceled Company Stock Appreciation Rights becoming entitled to receive in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock Appreciation Rights, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding as contemplated in Section 1.6) equal to:  (A) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Appreciation Right; multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Appreciation Rights (the “Company Stock Appreciation Right Consideration”); and (iii) to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Equity Appreciation Right, including each formerly Unvested Company Equity Appreciation Right, shall be canceled at the Effective Time, with the former holder of such canceled Company Equity Appreciation Rights becoming entitled to receive in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Equity Appreciation Rights, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding as contemplated in Section 1.6) equal to:  (A) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the grant price per share of such Company Equity Appreciation Right; multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Equity Appreciation Rights (the “Company Equity Appreciation Right Consideration”); provided, however, that, if the exercise price or grant price per share, as applicable, of any such Company Stock Appreciation Right or Company Equity Appreciation Right is equal to or greater than the Common Stock Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Appreciation Rights or Company Equity Appreciation Rights shall be canceled and terminated without any consideration in respect thereof.  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Stock Appreciation Rights Consideration and the Company Equity Appreciation Right Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to deduction for any required withholding as contemplated in Section 1.6, at the Effective Time or at the Company’s next ordinary course payroll date (but in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days after the Effective Time).

(c)          The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) and the Company, as applicable, shall take such actions as are necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.5, including making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof or any administrator of a Stock Plan as may be necessary; provided, however, that such actions shall not include the obligation to seek any consent, acknowledgement, representation, covenant or release from any holder of any Company Equity Award in connection therewith. 


(d)          Promptly following the Agreement Date, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions to provide that, (i) with respect to any outstanding Offering Period(s) (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) under the Company ESPP as of the Agreement Date, no participant in the Company ESPP may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election in effect on the Agreement Date for such Offering Period and no new participants may participate in such Offering Period; (ii)  no new Offering Period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP on or after the Agreement Date; (iii) any Offering Period under the Company ESPP that does not end prior to the Effective Time shall terminate and a Subscription Date (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) shall occur under the Company ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Offering Period, in which case any shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to such Offering Period shall be treated the same as all other shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.2(a); and (iv) immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall terminate. 


Section 1.6          Withholding Rights.  Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, their respective Affiliates, and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Law.  If the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or other applicable withholding agent, as the case may be, so withholds, then such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation, Parent, any of their respective Affiliates, or other applicable withholding agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. All compensatory amounts subject to payroll reporting and withholding payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be payable as promptly as possible through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll in accordance with applicable payroll procedures. The Person withholding pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall pay over such withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental Authority.

Section 1.7          Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the delivery by such Person of a written indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article I.

Section 1.9          Warrants.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of any Warrants notice required under the terms of the Warrant Documentation (if any). The Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Warrants that automatically become null and void as of the Effective Time if not exercised prior thereto, which shall expire in accordance with their terms if unexercised) shall remain outstanding immediately following the Effective Time and shall not be affected by the Merger (except for the effects specifically set forth in the Warrant Documentation).  The Surviving Corporation, and to the extent required under the applicable Warrant Documentation, Parent, shall comply with any obligations under the applicable Warrant Documentation. 


Section 1.10          Adjustments to Merger Consideration.  The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend  (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger, issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock occurring on or after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock, Convertible Preferred Stock and Company Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and shall, as so adjusted from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 1.10 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to the Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement, including Section 5.2.

(iv)          at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith based on the information then available that (A) failure to take such action would continue to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) with respect to any such action to be taken in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, in each case taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination pursuant to clause (iii) above; and 


(v)          in the event of a termination of this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 and paid the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.4.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed without the Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by applicable Law.

Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 5.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including, to the extent applicable, a duty to advance reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or other Affiliates that occurred prior to or at the Effective Time or (ii) any of the Transactions; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification or advancement under this Section 5.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.  In the event of any such claim, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all and/or advance reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person promptly after statements therefor are received. No Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent. 


(c)          Insurance.  The Company currently maintains a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (“D&O Insurance”), an accurate and complete summary of which has been made available by the Company to Parent or Parent’s Representatives prior to the Agreement Date.  Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on the D&O Insurance for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such D&O Insurance with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the D&O Insurance; provided, that in no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with respect to the D&O Insurance, it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.  The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder.

(d)          Successors and Assigns.  If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.10. 


(e)          No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries.  The obligations set forth in this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives).  Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.  The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 5.10 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity). 


(f)          Joint and Several Obligations.  The obligations and liability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries under this Section 5.10 shall be joint and several.

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. 


Section 5.11          Transaction Litigation.  Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of all Legal Proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers, in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any of the other Transactions (“Transaction Litigation”) (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and thereafter keep Parent fully informed with respect to the status thereof.  The Company shall (a) give Parent reasonable opportunity (at Parent’s sole expense and subject to a customary joint defense agreement) to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation.  Further, the Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or propose or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).  For purposes of this Section 5.11, “participate” means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the avoidance of doubt, Parent’s right to “participate” in the defense and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation, but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

(f)          Without limiting the generality of Section 8.4, nothing in this Section 5.13 shall (i) be construed to limit the right of Parent, the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to amend or terminate any Company Plan or other employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, (ii) be construed as an amendment to any Company Plan or other employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) be construed to require Parent, the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to retain the employment of any particular Person for any fixed period of time following the Effective Time or (iv) create any third- party beneficiary or other right in any other Person, including any current or former director, officer, employee or other service provider or any participant in any Company Plan, Parent Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof), including any Covered Employee.

(b)          In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the proviso to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(g) as a result of the material breach of the Company’s covenants and agreements set forth in Section 5.3, (B) any Person shall have publicly disclosed an offer or proposal for a Competing Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and shall not have publicly withdrawn such offer or proposal for a Competing Acquisition Proposal prior to (1) in the case of this Agreement being subsequently terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b), the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Termination Date or (2) in the case of this Agreement being subsequently terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(g), the time of the breach or failure to perform giving rise to such termination and (C) within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(g), the foregoing Competing Acquisition Transaction is consummated,  or the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Competing Acquisition Transaction, then within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of the entry into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and the consummation of such Competing Acquisition Transaction, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. 


(c)          In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. 


(d)          The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events. 


(e)          Recovery.  Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that the covenants set forth in this Section 7.4 are an integral part of this Agreement and the Merger, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.  Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 7.4 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 7.4 or any portion thereof, the Company will pay to Parent its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and costs) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made plus 1% through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law. 


(f)          Acknowledgement.  Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.4 are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions and shall be (together with all interest as described in Section 7.4(e)) the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement where the Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4 and the Company Termination Fee is actually paid to Parent.

Section 8.6          Specific Performance. 


(a)          The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 7.4, (A) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 7.4 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate Parent and Merger Subsidiary for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. 


(b)          The parties hereto hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any party hereto, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any party under this Agreement.

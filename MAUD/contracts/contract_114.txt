THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of April 25, 2021 by and among Project Kafka Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), Project Kafka Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and Proofpoint, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the “Parties,” and individually as a “Party.” All capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in Annex A. 


WITNESSETH: 


WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 


WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; 


WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) has unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (c) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting; 


WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has unanimously approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Financing; 


WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole stockholder, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (c) resolved to recommend that the sole stockholder of Merger Sub adopt this Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub; 


WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company’s directors and officers have entered into voting agreements in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Voting Agreements”), dated as of the date hereof, with Parent and the Company, pursuant to which, among other things, such individuals have agreed to vote such individuals’ shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the approval of this Agreement; and 


WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with this Agreement.   1








________________


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows: 


ARTICLE 1 


THE MERGER 


Section 1.1    The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”) and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. 


Section 1.2    Effective Time of Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL in order to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”). 


Section 1.3    General Effects of Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 


Section 1.4    Effect of Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company: (a)    Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 


(b)    Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $176.00 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). All shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 1.4(b) shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist on the conversion thereof, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (“Book- Entry Shares”) and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4(b). 


(c)    Treatment of Cancelled Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise), Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,   2








________________


shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such shares, the “Cancelled Shares”). 


(d)    Treatment of Dissenting Shares. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised and validly perfected appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such shares held by any such holder (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with, but only if, as and when required by, the provisions of such Section 262, unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares shall thereafter be no longer considered Dissenting Shares under this Agreement and shall be treated as if they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in accordance with Section 1.4(b). At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the Merger and afford Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands and the Company shall consider in good faith comments or suggestions proposed by Parent with respect to such demands. The Company shall not make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or settle any such demands without the prior written consent of Parent. 


(e)    Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change. 


Section 1.5    Effect of Merger on Company Equity Awards. 


(a)    Company Options. (i)    At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is vested in accordance with its terms and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company Option”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the per-share exercise price for such Vested Company Option, by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Company Option, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Vested Company Option Consideration”); provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Vested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Vested Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof. (ii)    At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not a Vested Company Option (each, an “Unvested Company Option”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the per-share exercise price   3








________________


for such Unvested Company Option, by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Unvested Company Option (the “Unvested Company Option Consideration”); provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Unvested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Unvested Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof. Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Company Option from which such Unvested Company Option Consideration was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, except as provided on Section 1.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedules, shall otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of the Unvested Company Option Consideration amounts, provided that no such changes shall impair the rights of the applicable holder of Unvested Company Option Consideration) with respect to their receipt of the Unvested Company Option Consideration. 


(b)    Company RSUs. (i)    At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and either (x) held by a non-employee member of the Company Board or (y) vested in accordance with its terms as of the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company RSU”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Vested Company RSU Consideration”). (ii)    At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and not a Vested Company RSU shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU, by (y) the Merger Consideration (the “Unvested Company RSU Consideration”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company RSU Consideration amounts will vest and become payable at the same time as the Company RSU from which such Unvested Company RSU Consideration was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, except as provided on Section 1.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedules, shall otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of the Unvested Company RSU Consideration amounts, provided that no such changes shall impair the rights of the applicable holder of Unvested Company RSU Consideration) with respect to their receipt of the Unvested Company RSU Consideration. 


(c)    Company PSUs. (i)    At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and vested in accordance with its terms as of the Effective Time (including as a result of the attainment of the applicable performance metrics) (each, a “Vested Company PSU”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and   4








________________


converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested Company PSU based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the target level of performance, by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Vested Company PSU Consideration”). (ii)    At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not a Vested Company PSU shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the contingent right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company PSU based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the target level of performance, by (y) the Merger Consideration (the “Unvested Company PSU Consideration”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, such Unvested Company PSU Consideration amounts will vest and be payable at the same time as the Company PSU from which such Unvested Company PSU Consideration was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and, except as provided on Section 1.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedules, shall otherwise remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (except (x) that no performance-based vesting metrics or criteria shall apply from and after the Effective Time and (y) for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform the administration of the Unvested Company PSU Consideration amounts, provided that no such changes shall impair the rights of the applicable holder of Unvested Company PSU Consideration), with respect to their receipt of the Unvested Company PSU Consideration. 


(d)    Certain Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, acting through the Company Board or an appropriate committee thereof, shall take or cause to be taken, all actions, and provide all notices that are required to effectuate the terms of this Section 1.5. All Company Equity Plans (other than the agreements underlying, and the terms of the Company Equity Plans applicable to, the Unvested Company Option Consideration, Unvested Company RSU Consideration and the Unvested Company PSU Consideration, in each case, solely to the extent relevant to the terms and conditions of this Section 1.5) will terminate as of the Effective Time and the Company will take all action necessary to effect the foregoing. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in any such Company Equity Plans will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Following the date hereof, the Company shall provide to Parent or its counsel for review and approval drafts of any documentation prepared by the Company or its counsel to effectuate the foregoing and shall consider in good faith Parent’s timely comments thereto. 


(e)    Treatment of Employees Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Company ESPP, as soon as practicable (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required so that (i) participation in the Company ESPP shall be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement, (ii) participants may not increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement or make any separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement, (iii) no offering period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iv) each then outstanding purchase right shall be exercised as of the earlier of (A) the end of the offering period in effect on the date of this Agreement or (B) ten (10) days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs, and (v) the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to, but contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP). On such   5

exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, as amended pursuant to this Section 1.5(a), and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(b), subject to withholding of any applicable withholding Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP, as amended pursuant to this Section 1.5(e), be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest). 


Section 1.6    The Surviving Corporation. 


(a)    Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation. Subject to Section 7.8, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (but amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be “Proofpoint, Inc.”) shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation. 


(b)    Bylaws of Surviving Corporation. Subject to Section 7.8, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (but amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be “Proofpoint, Inc.”) shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such bylaws. 


(c)    Directors of Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 


(d)    Officers of Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

________________


no less than two (2) Business Days’ notice to the Company and (ii) the second (2nd) Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period, but subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver (if and to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in Section 2.2 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if and to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the “Closing Date.” 


Section 2.2    Conditions to Closing. 


(a)    Conditions to Obligation of Each Party. The respective obligations of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing of the following conditions: (i)    Stockholder Approval. The Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained. (ii)    Regulatory Approvals. (A) Any waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the Merger shall have expired or been earlier terminated, and (B) all other Consents of (or filings or registrations with) any Governmental Entity required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement set forth on Schedule 2.2(a)(ii) shall have been obtained.

Such cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall be referred to as the “Payment Fund.” (ii)    Investment of Payment Fund.

(ii)    On surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent shall be required to promptly deliver to each such holder, the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.3. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable on due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid.

Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.3(b) (i) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.3. 


(d)    Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, on the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in accordance with Section 1.4(b) with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

Section 2.5    Withholding. The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, or any other Person, pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or under any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

The equity financing committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter is referred to in this Agreement as the “Equity Financing.” The Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are collectively referred to as the “Financing.” The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter, and, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, entitled to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter.

(d)    Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources and the Equity Investors, as applicable, to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Debt Financing Sources or the Equity Investors, as applicable, to reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating to the amount or availability of the Financing pursuant to any “flex” provision. As of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have knowledge as of the date hereof that any Debt Financing Sources or Equity Investors will not perform its obligations thereunder. There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment Letters that could affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Financing.

Without limiting the parties’ rights and obligations under Section 7.3(d), it is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or negotiations expressly permitted under this Article 6 shall not (in and of itself) constitute a Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement.

Section 7.3    Company Stockholder Approval. 


(a)    The Company shall prepare and, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) Business Days) after the date hereof, file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and furnish all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, and anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, which the Company shall consider in good faith.

If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party or Parties hereto (as the case may be) and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by the   40

Company with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement (which resolution will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company prior to the end of the tenth (10th) calendar day after filing the preliminary Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, the “Clearance Date”); provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if the Clearance Date occurs prior to the end of the Go-Shop Period, the Company will not be required to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company until the expiration of the Go-Shop Period but shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days) after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period. 


(b)    Subject to the terms of Section 7.3(d), the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company to set a record date for, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Stockholder Meeting”) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Clearance Date. Once established, the Company shall not change the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Unless the Company shall have made a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 7.3(d), the Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including by soliciting proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement). 


(c)    The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting (it being understood that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times or for more than 45 calendar days in total pursuant to this clause (ii) without Parent’s prior written consent), (iii) if the Company reasonably determines in good faith that the Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained (it being understood that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times or for more than 45 calendar days in total pursuant to this clause (iii) without Parent’s prior written consent) or (iv) with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting. 


(d)    Except as otherwise permitted in this Section 7.3(d), the Company Board shall not (i) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the Company Recommendation (it being understood that it shall be considered a modification adverse to Parent if (1) any Alternative Acquisition Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer is commenced and the Company Board fails to publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company’s stockholders within ten (10) Business Days of commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (2) any Alternative Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced (other than by the commencement of a tender or exchange offer) and the Company Board fails to issue a public   41

press release within five (5) Business Days of such public announcement providing that the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation), (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable any Alternative Acquisition Proposal (or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable any Alternative Acquisition Proposal), (iii) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions (provided that, in the event Parent has not previously requested the Company Board to make such a reaffirmation, there shall be no limit on the number of reaffirmations that Parent may request in response to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal)) or (iv) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any such action, a “Change of Recommendation”). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company at any time after the date of this Agreement, provided that (A) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of the Company’s intention to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal, which shall include a description of the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal and a copy of any proposed definitive agreement(s) relating to such Superior Proposal, including any related financing commitments, if any, (C) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to Article 6 and this Section 7.3 with respect to such Superior Proposal, (D) the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and/or the Commitment Letters so that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, (E) following such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that are binding on Parent and Merger Sub and irrevocable by Parent and Merger Sub until the expiration of the foregoing five-Business Day period (assuming the execution and delivery by the Company of the applicable definitive agreement) and any other information provided by Parent) shall have determined that the failure of the Company Board to make such a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (F) in the event of a termination of this Agreement in order to cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(c)(iii), including paying the Company Termination Fee. In the event of any material amendments or modifications to such Alternative Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that any change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification), the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 7.3(d) with respect to such new written notice (it being understood that the five (5) Business Day period shall be three (3) Business Days with respect to such new written notice, but in no event shorter than five (5) Business Days following the original written notice). In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may also effect a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided that (i) the Company Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of the Company’s intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event, which shall include a description in reasonable detail of the applicable Intervening Event, (ii) the Company Board shall have given Parent an opportunity to meet and negotiate with the Company and its advisors during the foregoing five (5) Business Day period (to the extent that Parent desires to so meet and negotiate) to discuss the foregoing Intervening Event and any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response thereto to obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation, and following such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and taking into   42

account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall have determined that the failure of the Company Board to make such a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that each time any material amendment or modification to the Intervening Event occurs, the Company shall notify Parent of such amendment or modification in writing and the time period set forth in the preceding clause (ii) shall recommence and be extended for two (2) Business Days from the day of such notification.

Section 7.4    Parent Financing. 


(a)    Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives) to use reasonable best efforts to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Commitment Letters and the Debt Fee Letters as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event prior to the Closing Date, including by using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing (the “Definitive Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any Debt Fee Letter), (iii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions, which are within Parent or Merger Sub’s control, in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Agreements and comply with its obligations thereunder and (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (other than the consummation of the Merger and those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at Closing) have been satisfied or waived, Parent shall (1) use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources to comply with their respective obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and (2) cause each Equity Investor to comply with its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, in each case, including to fund the Financing on the Closing Date, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 


(b)    Parent shall not without the prior written consent of the Company: (i) permit any amendment, termination or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters or any Debt Fee Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy: (A) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Financing, (B) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount as compared to the fees and original issue discount contemplated by the Debt Fee Letters on the date of this Agreement unless the amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount) such that the aggregate amount of the Financing would be less than the amount required to pay the Financing Amounts, (C) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement or (D) otherwise   43

would reasonably be expected to hinder, delay or prevent the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement or modification to effectuate any “market flex” terms contained in the Debt Fee Letters provided as of the date hereof or to add or replace any additional agents, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other financial institutions thereto as provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the replacement of any agents, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners or other financial institutions pursuant to an exercise of the Second Lien Preplacement Right (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof) that otherwise complies with this Section 7.4(b)) shall be permitted and shall not require written consent of the Company. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any written amendment, modification, waiver or replacement relating to the Financing promptly upon execution thereof (including, without limitation, any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement in connection with the exercise of the Second Lien Preplacement Right (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof)). 


(c)    In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing required, together with the portion of the Financing that remains available, to pay the Financing Amounts becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (the “Alternative Financing”) (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Financing, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the Financing Amounts) from the same or other sources and which are on terms (taken as a whole) not less favorable to Parent (or its Affiliates) than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such Alternative Financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any commitment letters and any related fee letters (subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee amounts, pricing caps, original issue discount, “market flex” and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with transactions of this type, none of which redacted provisions would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination, aggregate principal amount or availability of the Alternative Financing on the Closing Date) with respect to any Alternative Financing. As applicable, for the purposes of this Agreement, (A) the term “Commitment Letters” shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question) and (B) the Debt Financing shall include any Alternative Financing. Parent shall provide the Company with (x) prompt written notice of any material breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters relating to the Financing and (y) a copy of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any actual or alleged (in writing) material breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Fee Letter. To the extent requested by the Company, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and in reasonable detail of its efforts to consummate the Financing and, upon the Company’s reasonable request, provide to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of the material Definitive Agreements for the Debt Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Parent with this Section 7.4 shall not relieve Parent of its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available. 


(d)    From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (and their respective Representatives) to use reasonable best efforts, to provide customary cooperation with Parent and Merger Sub, in each case, at Parent’s sole cost and expense, as is customary for financings of the type contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its Affiliates), including using reasonable best efforts to, in each case to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in writing (for the avoidance of doubt, email correspondence being sufficient): (i)    furnish Parent the Required Financial Information;   44

(e)    The foregoing notwithstanding, none of the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 7.4 that would: (i) require the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or any persons who are officers or directors of such entities to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing, except those which are subject to the occurrence of the Closing passed by directors or officers continuing in their positions following the Closing, (ii) require the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or any persons who are officers or directors of such entities to enter into, execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement, in each case, that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than the execution of customary authorization letters and representation letters referenced above), (iii) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iv) require the Company or any of its Affiliates to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing or have any obligation of the Company or any of its Affiliates under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective prior to the Closing, (v) cause any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Company or any of its Affiliates to incur any personal liability, (vi) conflict with the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any Laws, (vii) reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any Company Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party, (viii) provide access to or disclose information that the Company or any of its Affiliates reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege; provided, that the Company or such Subsidiary shall use reasonable best efforts to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information, and in the case of any confidentiality obligation, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by such confidentiality obligations, notify Parent if any such information that Parent, Merger Sub or any Debt Financing Source has specifically identified and requested is being withheld as a result of any such obligation of confidentiality, or (ix) require the Company to prepare any financial statements or information that are not available to it and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice. Nothing contained in this Section 7.4 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Affiliates, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly on request by the Company, reimburse the Company or any of its Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by them or their respective representatives in connection with such cooperation (it being understood that the reimbursement set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to any fees, costs and expenses incurred by, or on behalf of, the Company in connection with its ordinary course financial reporting requirements) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and their respective representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent or its representatives pursuant to this Section 7.4 and any information used in connection therewith, except with respect to any losses suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 


(f)    The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 7.4 represent the sole obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing to be obtained by Parent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Commitment Letters, and no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) or the Commitment Letters shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. In no event   46

shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing) by Parent any of its Affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s obligations under this Agreement. 


(g)    All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company or any of its Affiliates obtained by Parent or its representatives pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that Parent shall be permitted to disclose information as necessary and consistent with customary practices in connection with the Financing subject to customary confidentiality arrangements. 


(h)    The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and its subsidiaries by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, however, that Parent shall ensure that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or that is not reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Company or the Company’s reputation or goodwill. 


Section 7.5    Convertible Notes; Capped Call Transactions. 


(a)    On the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, as and to the extent required by the Convertible Notes Indenture, execute, and use reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, any supplemental indenture(s) required by the Convertible Notes Indenture and deliver any certificates and other documents required by the Convertible Notes Indenture to be delivered by such persons in connection with such supplemental indenture(s). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to the immediately preceding sentence, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give any notices and take all actions required under, and with prior consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, may take actions permitted, under the terms of the Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes Indenture or under applicable Law, and shall take any other actions reasonably requested by Parent to the extent such actions are permitted or contemplated by, the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture, the Convertible Notes or any applicable Law (with respect to the Convertible Notes Indenture or the Convertible Notes) in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which actions shall include, without limitation, the Company (or its Subsidiaries or other Company Representatives, as applicable) (i) giving any notices that may be required in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and making any repurchases or conversions of the Convertible Notes occurring prior to or as a result of the Merger, (ii) preparing any supplemental indentures required in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation thereof to be executed and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the Effective Time, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and Parent, and (iii) taking all such further actions, including, without limitation, delivering any officer’s certificates and legal opinions, as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes Indenture in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may make any settlement election with respect to any Conversion Date (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) under the Convertible Notes Indenture (provided that the Company shall be permitted only to cash settle any conversion) and settle conversions or effect redemptions of the Convertible Notes pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, wherever referred to in Section 7.1 of this Agreement, shall be deemed to include effecting any repurchases or conversions under the terms of the Convertible Notes and the Convertible Notes Indenture. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.5, but subject to the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture, nothing herein shall require the Company to make any payment with respect to the Convertible Notes in connection with the Merger (including in connection with the settlement of any conversion obligations), prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time. 


(b)    The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any notices, certificates, press releases, supplemental indentures, or other documents or instruments deliverable pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture prior to the dispatch or making thereof and shall incorporate all reasonable comments provided by Parent and its counsel with respect thereto.   47

(c)    Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to facilitate the settlement of the Capped Call Transactions at or promptly following the Effective Time as reasonably requested by Parent and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent with respect to Parent’s efforts to negotiate any termination payments or valuations related to the settlement of the Capped Call Transactions that is effective at or after the Effective Time; provided, that the Company shall not (x) agree to amend, modify or waive any terms relating to, or agree to any amount due upon the termination or settlement of, the Capped Call Transactions (except for amounts due upon exercise or termination of the Capped Call Transactions in accordance with their terms in connection with conversions of the Convertible Notes prior to the Effective Time) or (y) initiate or continue discussions or negotiations with the counterparties to the Capped Call Transactions or any of their respective affiliates or any other Person regarding termination or settlement of the Capped Call Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent, and to the extent any such discussions or negotiations have occurred prior to date hereof, provide Parent with reasonable detail regarding the substance of all such discussions or negotiations and copies of any documentation sent or received in connection therewith (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that limitations in the immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply to any modification, adjustment or termination made unilaterally by any of the counterparties to the Capped Call Transactions pursuant to the terms of the applicable Capped Call Documentation or conditioned on termination or abandonment of this Agreement); provided, further, that nothing herein shall require the Company to (A) make any payment with respect to the termination or settlement of any Capped Call Transaction as a result of the Merger prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time or (B) enter into any instrument or agreement relating to the termination or settlement of the Capped Call Transactions, or agree to any change or modification to any Capped Call Documentation, that is effective prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall provide Parent with all written notices or other documents received by it with respect to any determination, cancellation, termination, exercise, settlement, adjustment or computation under, or in connection with any discussions or negotiations related to, the Capped Call Transactions and hereby grants permission to Parent and its counsel and advisors to, at any time, initiate and engage in discussions and negotiations with the counterparties to the Capped Call Transactions regarding the settlement of the Capped Call Transactions at or promptly following the Effective Time and the terms of such settlement, provided that the Company and its counsel will, to the extent reasonably practicable, have a reasonable opportunity to participate in such discussions and negotiations. 


(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time and without limitation to the other provisions of this Section 7.5, the Company shall take all such actions as may be required by the terms of the applicable Capped Call Transactions or applicable Law, including the giving of any written notices or communication in connection with the Merger and/or any conversions and/or repurchases of the Convertible Notes or any adjustment under the Convertible Notes Indenture or occurring as a result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent and its counsel reasonable time and opportunity to review any such written notice or communication prior to the dispatch or making thereof and shall incorporate all reasonable comments provided by Parent and its counsel with respect thereto. 


Section 7.6    Interim Access to Company. Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall afford to Parent and to its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, financing sources and agents and other representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) sources reasonable access, solely for purposes of effectuating or consummating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or integration and transition planning relating thereto, during normal business hours, on reasonable advance notice, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ properties, contracts, commitments, personnel, books and records, other than any such matters that relate to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, including with respect to the consideration or valuation of the Merger or any financial or strategic alternatives thereto, or any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, provided that the Company may provide such access by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under applicable Law (including any COVID-19 Measures). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to afford such access or furnish such information if it would unreasonably   48

disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation or breach of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade secret protection to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would result in the disclosure of any information in connection with any litigation or similar dispute between the Parties hereto or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law; provided that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and thereafter the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the disclosure of such information (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that would not violate the foregoing. Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or any of its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be “Confidential Information,” as such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement. 


Section 7.7    Employee Matters. 


(a)    Change in Control. Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time. 


(b)    Company Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms (it being understood that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Surviving Corporation, Parent or its Affiliates from amending, modifying, replacing or terminating such arrangements in accordance with their terms). 


(c)    Post-Closing Protection Period. For the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (A) the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time and (B) the date of termination of the Company Employee (such earlier period, the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to provide to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remains so employed immediately after the Effective Time (“Company Employees”) (i) base compensation and target annual or short-term cash incentive opportunities (including target short-term commission-based cash incentive opportunities) that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing set forth in this Section 7.7 will require Parent to provide compensation in the form of equity or equity-based compensation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company Employee whose employment terminates during the Continuation Period under circumstances that would give rise to cash severance pay or benefits under the existing terms of the Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules and designated thereon as a severance plan, policy or practice (the “Company Severance Plans”), cash severance pay equal to the cash severance pay provided under the Company Severance Plans. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.7 to the contrary, the terms and conditions of employment of any Company Employee whose terms and conditions of employment are subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement, shall be governed by such applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement. 


(d)    Service Crediting. For all purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits under the corresponding employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any defined benefit pension benefits or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any New Plans to   49








________________


the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to and replaces a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and vision insurance benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived or satisfied under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan to the extent such amounts were credited to such person for the same purpose under the Old Plan. 


(e)    No Employment Commitments. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11, the provisions of this Section 7.7 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, employee or consultant or any other person shall be a third- party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to, or the establishment, modification or termination of, any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose. 


Section 7.8    Indemnification and Insurance. 


(a)    Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that all indemnification or other similar agreements between any current or former directors, officers or employees, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in each case in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the consummation of the Merger and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of the Company and any Subsidiaries of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding (as defined below) pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such six-year period. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 7.8. 


(b)    Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent provided in the governing and organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof and all indemnification or other similar agreements between any current or former directors, officers or employees, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in each case in effect as of the date hereof, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing or any related expenses) each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators, and successors and assigns, an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts   50

paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in all cases solely to the extent provided in the governing and organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof. In the event of any such Proceeding, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Proceeding. 


(c)    Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six-year prepaid “tail” policy on the Company’s current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the aggregate cost of such “tail” policy shall not exceed 400% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder. 


(d)    Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.8 in the event Parent is found to have been in breach of any of the foregoing. 


(e)    The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 7.8 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 


(f)    In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8. 


Section 7.9    Takeover Statute. If any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition” or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the members of their respective boards of directors shall use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby. 


Section 7.10    Public Announcements. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release as the first public disclosure of this Agreement. Prior to the issuance of a press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement (including any proposed termination hereof) or the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment on any press release or other public statement or comment relating   51

Section 7.11    Other Investors. Prior to the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not permit or agree to permit any Person, other than the Equity Investors, to obtain any equity interests (or rights to obtain any equity interests) in Parent or Merger Sub if such acquisition of equity interests or rights to obtain such equity interests would reasonably be expected to (a) delay in any material respect the obtaining of, or increase in any material respect the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (b) increase in any material respect the risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (c) increase in any material respect the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise. 


Section 7.12    Management. Prior to the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Parent shall not, and shall not knowingly permit or agree to permit any Person (acting at its direction) to, directly or indirectly, have any formal or informal discussions, or directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not binding) with any director, officer or other employee of the Company relating to (i) any retention, severance or other compensation, incentives or benefits that may be or become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or after the Effective Time, (ii) any equity rollover or other similar transaction, or any equity or other investment in Parent, the Company or any parent company thereof, or any affiliate of Parent, the Company or any parent company thereof, following the Effective Time or (iii) any directorship, employment, consulting arrangement or other similar association or involvement of any directors, officers or other employees of the Company with Parent, the Company or any parent company thereof, or affiliate of Parent, the Company or any parent company thereof, from and after the Effective Time.

Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other reasonably informed of (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto), and cooperate with such Party in connection with, any stockholder litigation or claim against such Party and/or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such litigation, “Stockholder Litigation”).

Section 8.3    Termination Fees. 


(a)    Company Termination Fee. If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), or (iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (substituting for purposes of this Section 8.3(a) in the definition thereof “50%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase appears) is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not publicly withdrawn, (B) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(i) and (C) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company shall have (1) consummated any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (2) entered into a definitive agreement providing for (and later consummated) any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, then, in each case, the Company shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, a fee of $368,946,000 in cash (the “Company Termination Fee”); provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal received from an Excluded Party, then the “Company Termination Fee” shall be $122,982,000.

further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, except to the extent provided in Section 8.2. 


(b)    Parent Termination Fee. If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c) (ii), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) and at such time the Company could have validly terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(ii), then Parent shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company, a fee of $676,400,000 in cash (the “Parent Termination Fee”), such payment to be made within three (3) Business Days of such termination (it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion). On the payment by Parent of the Parent Termination Fee as and when required by this Section 8.3(b), none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives shall have any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to the Company or its Affiliates or Representatives. 


(c)    Acknowledgements. Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without Section 8.3(a), Parent would not have entered into this Agreement and that, without Section 8.3(b), the Company would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, respectively, all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including attorneys’ fees as well as expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated seeking such payment), together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be made. The Parties further acknowledge that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Parties further acknowledge that the right to receive the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not limit or otherwise affect any such Party’s right to specific performance as provided in Section 9.5, provided that in no event shall either Party be entitled to receive both specific performance and payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable. 


(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but without limiting or affecting Parent’s rights to specific performance expressly set forth in Section 9.5, in any circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Parent is paid the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(c) shall, subject to Section 9.5, be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Parent Related Parties against the Company, its subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, managers, members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives, agents or any their respective assignees or successors or any former, current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative, agent, assignee or successor of any of the foregoing (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or in respect of representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, except that   56

nothing shall relieve the Company of its obligations under Section 7.10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(d) will not relieve the Company from liability for fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement; provided that under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches (including any willful and material breach) under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed an amount equal to $368,946,000 in the aggregate for all such breaches (if any) (the “Company Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against any of the Company Related Parties, and in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against the Company Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. 


(e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but without limiting or affecting the Company’s rights to specific enforcement expressly set forth in Section 9.5, in any circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and the Company is paid the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, if applicable, any costs and expenses of the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (and the obligations of each Equity Investor under the Guarantee (in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof) with respect thereto), the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(ii) and receipt of payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall, subject to Section 9.5, be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company Related Parties against any of Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Investors, or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, direct or indirect equity holders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, affiliated (or commonly advised) funds, representatives, agents or any their respective assignees or successors or any former, current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, controlling Person, direct or indirect equity holder, manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, affiliated (or commonly advised) fund, representative, agent, assignee or successor of any of the foregoing (collectively, excluding Parent and Merger Sub, the “Parent Related Parties”) or the lenders, agents, underwriters, commitment parties and arrangers of any Debt Financing (including pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, any Debt Fee Letter or any engagement letters, credit agreements, loan agreements, joinders or indentures relating to any Debt Financing) or any Debt Financing Sources, together with their respective Affiliates, and their respective Affiliates’ officers, directors, employees, controlling persons, advisors, attorneys, agents and representatives and their successors and assigns, including any successors or assigns via joinder agreements or credit agreements related thereto (collectively, each, a “Lender Related Party” and together, the “Lender Related Parties”) for any cost, expense, loss or damage suffered as a result of, or arising from or otherwise in connection with (i) this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, any Debt Fee Letter, the Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letters or any of the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) the failure of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated (including the funding of the Financing), (iii) any breach (or threatened or alleged breach) of, or failure (or threatened or alleged failure) to perform under, this Agreement or any of the other documents delivered herewith or executed in connection herewith or otherwise or (iv) any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith (collectively, the “Transaction Related Matters”); provided, however, that this Section 8.3(e) shall not relieve any Parent Related Party for any liability (A) for fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement or (B) for any breach of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, further, that under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for breaches (including any willful and material breach) under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement), the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal to $676,400,000 plus the reimbursement obligations set forth in Section 7.4(e) and any amounts due by Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(c) in the aggregate for all such breaches (the “Parent Liability Limitation”).

Except as expressly provided in this Section 8.3(e), none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Parent Related Parties or the Lender Related Parties shall have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of or in connection with any Transaction Related Matters, except that nothing shall relieve Parent of its obligations under Section 7.6, Section 7.10 and Section 7.4(e), and none of the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any other Company Related Party shall seek or be entitled to seek or recover any damages or seek or be entitled to any remedy, whether based on a claim at Law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages suffered in connection with any Transaction Related Matters.

This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the Merger, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In addition, each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the Merger, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).

Section 9.5    Specific Enforcement. 


(a)    The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, (i) the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to obtain (A) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (B) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, and (ii) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. 


(b)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to cause the Equity Financing to be funded   59

under the Equity Commitment Letters and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger if, but only if, (A) all of the conditions in Section 2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b) have been, and continue to be, satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied at the Closing)) at the time the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.1, (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur in accordance with Section 2.1 and (D) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate the Merger by the time the Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1. In no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce specifically Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (or exercise its third party beneficiary rights under the Equity Commitment Letter) if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to a remedy of specific performance or other equitable remedies against any Debt Financing Source. The election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b); provided that in no event shall the Company be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief or any other remedy under this Agreement or available at law or equity following the payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 


(c)    Each Party further agrees that (i) it will not raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.5, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

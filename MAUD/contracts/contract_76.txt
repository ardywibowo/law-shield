ARTICLE 2 


CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 


Section 2.1    Effect of the Mergers on Capital Stock. 


(a)    At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Surviving Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Surviving Merger Sub: 


(i)    Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time, but excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive (A) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio   -4-

(the “Share Consideration”), subject to Section 2.1(e) with respect to fractional Parent Common Shares, and (B) $90.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration” and, together with the Share Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). All shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a) shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist on the conversion thereof, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (“Common Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate that, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Common Certificate”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including the right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.1(e), the Fractional Share Cash Amount) into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Common Book-Entry Share or Common Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(i). 


(ii)    Treatment of Excluded Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that is directly owned by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise), Parent or either Merger Sub immediately prior to the First Effective Time, other than shares held on behalf of third parties, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such shares, the “Cancelled Shares”). Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than either Merger Sub) immediately prior to the First Effective Time, other than shares held on behalf of third parties, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive such number of Parent Common Shares equal to (A) the Cash Consideration divided by the Parent Share Price plus (B) the Exchange Ratio (each such share, together with the Cancelled Shares, the “Excluded Shares”). 


(iii)    Conversion of First Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of First Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation. From and after the First Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of First Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 


(iv)    Conversion of Company Preferred Stock. Each share of Company Preferred Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time, but excluding Dissenting Shares and Cancelled Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $37.50 per share in cash (the “Preferred Merger Consideration”). All shares of Company Preferred Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)(iv) shall be automatically cancelled on the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and uncertificated shares of Company Preferred Stock represented by book-entry form (“Preferred Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate that, immediately prior to the First   -5-








________________


Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Preferred Stock (each, a “Preferred Certificate”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Preferred Stock represented by such Preferred Book-Entry Share or Preferred Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(iv). 


(b)    At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of the Second Surviving Corporation, Surviving Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Second Surviving Corporation or Surviving Merger Sub, (i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Surviving Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding, all of which shares shall be held by Parent and which shall not be affected by the Second Merger and (ii) each share of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto, such that, immediately following the Second Merger, the Second Surviving Corporation shall be a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. 


(c)    Dissenters’ Rights. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such shares held by any such holder (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the First Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares shall thereafter be no longer considered Dissenting Shares under this Agreement and shall be treated as if they had been converted into, at the First Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, without any interest thereon, in accordance with Section 2.1(a). At the First Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or settle, offer to settle or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 


(d)    Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the First Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or the outstanding Parent Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of   -6-








________________


shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration and/or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change. 


(e)    No Fractional Shares. 


(i)    No fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued in connection with the First Merger and no certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall be delivered on the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i). Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the First Merger a fraction of a Parent Common Share (after aggregating all shares represented by the Common Certificates and Common Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu of such fractional Parent Common Share, cash (without interest) in an amount (rounded down to the nearest cent) representing such holder’s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregated number of fractional Parent Common Shares that would otherwise have been issuable to such holders as part of the Merger Consideration (the “Fractional Share Cash Amount”). 


(ii)    As soon as practicable after the First Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, on behalf of all such holders of fractional Parent Common Shares, effect the sale of all such Parent Common Shares that would otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration at the then-prevailing prices on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE. After the proceeds of such sale have been received, the Exchange Agent shall determine the applicable Fractional Share Cash Amount payable to each applicable holder and shall make such amounts available to such holders in accordance with Section 2.2(b). The payment of cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to such holders is not a separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange. 


(iii)    No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional Parent Common Share that would otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration. 


Section 2.2    Exchange of Certificates. 


(a)    Exchange Agent. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Merger Sub shall designate Computershare Investor Services Inc. or a bank or trust company or similar institution selected by Parent to serve as exchange agent hereunder and approved in advance by the Company in writing (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the “Exchange Agent”). Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall, on behalf of Surviving Merger Sub, deposit or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, (i) cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay (A) the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) and (B) the aggregate Preferred Merger Consideration   -7-








________________


payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iv) and (ii) evidence of Parent Common Shares in book-entry form representing the number of Parent Common Shares sufficient to deliver the aggregate Share Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i). Parent agrees to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent from time to time, as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Any such cash and book-entry shares deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” 


(b)    Payment Procedures. 


(i)    As soon as reasonably practicable after the First Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal with respect to Book-Entry Shares (to the extent applicable) and Certificates (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only on delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually reasonably agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Book-Entry Shares (to the extent applicable) or Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable.

To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock as of immediately prior to the date on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity shall cease to represent any claim of any kind or nature and shall be deemed to be surrendered for cancellation to Parent. 


(g)    Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government; provided, further, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article 2, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide, on behalf of Surviving Merger Sub, additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to or at the direction of Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(e). 


(h)    Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, on the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration (together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions deliverable pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in accordance with Section 2.1 with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

(b)    Each award of shares of Company Common Stock granted subject to any vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions (each, a “Company Restricted Share Award”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, shall, at the First Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share Award as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii) the accrued but unpaid cash dividends corresponding to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Share Award. Parent shall or shall cause the Second Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay to the holders of Company Restricted Share Awards the cash amounts and Parent Common Shares described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, promptly but no later than the next scheduled payroll of the Company that is at least four Business Days after the First Effective Time.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.3(c), each cash-based award covered by this Section 2.3(c) shall have the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms and conditions) as applied to the corresponding Company Performance Share Award; provided, that the performance-based vesting conditions shall no longer apply, the award will be subject only to service-based vesting, and each such award shall vest in full upon a Qualifying Termination. 


(d)    Each share of director deferred stock (each, a “Director Deferred Share”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, shall, at the First Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Section 4.5    Internal Controls and Procedures. 


(a)    Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Parent is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Parent’s filings with the SEC and Canadian Securities Administrators and other public disclosure documents. 


(b)    Parent maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) that is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent in all material respects, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, that access to assets is permitted only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent and that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Parent’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its Subsidiaries that are used in the systems of disclosure controls and procedures and of financial reporting controls and procedures described above are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or its accountants, except as would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect or disrupt, in any material respect, the Company’s systems of disclosure controls and procedures and of financial reporting controls and procedures or the reports generated thereby. 


(c)    Parent’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent’s internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2020, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Parent’s auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board, (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal control over financial reporting. As of the date of its most recent audited financial statements, neither Parent nor its auditors had identified any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting and, as of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, nothing has come to its attention that has caused it to believe that there are any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in such internal controls. To the Knowledge of Parent, since December 31, 2018, no material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from Parent employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have   -37-

(b)    Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide, unsolicited Company Alternative Proposal that did not result from the Company’s violation of this Section 5.4, the Company and its Representatives may contact the third party making such Company Alternative Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof. If (i) such Company Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors that such Company Alternative Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Company Alternative Proposal (including its Representatives and prospective equity and debt financing sources) in response to a request therefor, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company having confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are not less restrictive in the aggregate to such third party than the provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Company Alternative Proposal), provided, however, that if the third party making such Company Alternative Proposal is a known competitor of the Company, the Company shall not provide any commercially sensitive non-public information to such third party in connection with any actions permitted by this Section 5.4(b) other than in accordance with customary “clean room” or other similar procedures designed to limit the disclosure of competitively sensitive information, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including its Representatives) with respect to the Company Alternative Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if: (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal are received by the Company or any of its Representatives or (ii) any information is requested from the Company or any of its Representatives that, to the Knowledge of the Company, has been or is reasonably likely to have been made in connection with any Company Alternative Proposal, which notice shall identify the material terms and conditions thereof (including the name of the applicable third party and, if applicable, complete copies of any written requests, proposals or offers and any other material documents, including proposed agreements). It is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or negotiations permitted under this Section 5.4(b), including any public announcement that the Company or the Company Board has made any determination contemplated under this Section 5.4(b) to take or engage in any such actions, shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments regarding any   -57-

If (i) such Parent Alternative Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal or (ii) the Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors that such Parent Alternative Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, Parent may take the following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Parent Alternative Proposal (including its Representatives and prospective equity and debt financing sources) in response to a request therefor, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with Parent having confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are not less restrictive in the aggregate to such third party than the provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement are to the Company (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Parent Alternative Proposal), provided, however, that if the third party making such Parent Alternative Proposal is a known competitor of Parent, Parent shall not provide any commercially sensitive non-public information to such third party in connection with any actions permitted by this Section 5.5(b) other than in accordance with customary “clean room” or other similar procedures designed to limit the disclosure of competitively sensitive information, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including its Representatives) with respect to the Parent Alternative Proposal.

It is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or negotiations permitted under this Section 5.5(b), including any public announcement that Parent or the Parent Board has made any determination contemplated under this Section 5.5(b) to take or engage in any such actions, shall not constitute a Parent Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments regarding any Parent Alternative Proposals or any material change to the terms of any such Parent Alternative Proposal and any material change to the status of any such discussions or negotiations with respect thereto.   -61-

Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

Without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the approval of the Parent Share Issuance shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by Parent’s shareholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.

Parent agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not be affected solely by the commencement of or announcement or disclosure of or communication to the Company of any Parent Alternative Proposal, and further, that it shall not take action to terminate this Agreement on the grounds that such Parent Alternative Proposal is a Parent Superior Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company’s breach of any of the covenants required to be performed by it under this Section 5.12 shall not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b), unless such breach is the primary cause of Parent being unable to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing at the Closing. 


(d)    All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company or any of its Affiliates obtained by Parent or its representatives pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information to (i) the Financing Parties subject to their confidentiality obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters and the definitive documentation evidencing the Debt Financing and (ii) otherwise to the extent necessary and consistent with customary practices in connection with the Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

(b)    In the event any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters becomes unavailable regardless of the reason therefor, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of such unavailability and the reason therefor and (B) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, to obtain as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative debt financing for any such portion from alternative sources (the “Alternative Financing”) in an amount sufficient, when taken together with cash and the other sources of immediately funds available to Parent at the Closing to pay the Financing Amounts and that do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing. To the extent requested in writing by the Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing if there exists any actual or threatened material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement and a copy of any written notice or other written communication from any Financing Party with respect to any actual material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof.

(c)    None of Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (without the prior written consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) consent or agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement, termination or modification to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver (1) decreases the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that would be less than an amount that would be required, when taken together with cash or cash equivalents held by the Parent and the Company on the Closing Date and the other sources of funds available to Parent on the Closing Date, to pay the Cash Consideration, the Preferred Merger Consideration and all other cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement by Parent at the Closing, (2) could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (3) adversely impacts the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, or (4) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing; provided, that Parent may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify any of the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed such Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of   -80-

Upon any amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the Company (with only fee amounts and other customary terms redacted, none of which redacted provisions would adversely affect the conditionality or enforceability of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as so amended, supplemented or modified to the knowledge of the Parent) and, to the extent such amendment, supplement or modification has been made in compliance with this Section 5.13(c), the term “Debt Commitment Letters” shall mean the applicable Debt Commitment Letters as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this Section 5.13(c) shall not relieve Parent of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Debt Financing is available.

(ii)    If the Company is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of U.S. federal income Taxes under Section 1442 or 1445 of the Code from the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall remit the full amount so withheld and deducted to the applicable Governmental Entity and the Company shall pay additional amounts to Parent (“Parent Additional Amounts”) (such additional amounts to constitute additional proceeds for the disposition by the Parent of its rights under this Agreement) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by Parent (including the Parent Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction is not less than the amount Parent would have received if the Taxes had not been so withheld or deducted; provided, that the Company’s obligation to pay such Parent Additional Amounts shall not apply to the extent that the obligation to withhold or deduct any amount from the Company Termination Fee arises solely as the result of Parent’s failure to deliver to the Company, prior to the payment of the Company Termination Fee, a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from withholding under the U.S.-Canada Income Tax Treaty or IRS Form W-8ECI. Furthermore, without duplication of the foregoing sentence, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent from the full amount of any Taxes imposed on Parent under Section 881(a) the Code (together with any interest and penalties and expenses paid or payable by Parent with respect thereto) with respect to the receipt of the Company Termination Fee other than Taxes in respect of which amounts have been fully deducted and remitted and Parent Additional Amounts have been paid.

At the Company’s reasonable request and expense, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund from the applicable U.S. Governmental Entity of any Taxes in respect of which the Company has paid a Parent Additional Amount or indemnified Parent (or, if such refund cannot be obtained, to claim a credit for such Taxes). Parent shall promptly pay the amount of any such refund or credit obtained to the Company, net of any costs, Taxes and expenses borne by Parent with respect to such refund or credit; provided that Parent shall not be obligated to make any payment otherwise required pursuant to this sentence to the extent making such payment would place Parent in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification or Parent Additional Amount and giving rise to such refund or credit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or   -90-

Parent Additional Amount with respect to such Tax had never been paid. Parent and the Company agree: (i) to treat, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, payment of the Company Termination Fee and any Parent Additional Amounts as giving rise to gain or loss attributable to the cancellation, lapse, expiration or other termination of a right or obligation with respect to property which is (or on acquisition would be) a capital asset in the hands of Parent within the meaning of Section 1234A(1) of the Code, and (ii) not to take any position inconsistent with such treatment, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. The obligations described in this paragraph shall survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 7.2 or this Section 7.3(a), on the payment by the Company of the Company Termination Fee, the CN Termination Amount Refund and the Parent Additional Amounts as and when required by this Section 7.3(a), neither the Company nor any of its former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives shall have any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent or its Affiliates or Representatives.

(i)    If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to (A) Section 7.1(b)(i), and at the time of such termination, (1) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(d) (solely as a result of an injunction or Order entered or issued by a Governmental Entity pursuant to any Railroad Law or Section 721) has not been satisfied or waived and (2) all of the other conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided, that such conditions were then capable of being satisfied if the Closing had taken place) and no breach by the Company of its obligations under Section 5.8 has contributed materially and substantially to the failure of the condition set forth in the preceding clause (1) to be satisfied or (B) Section 7.1(b)(ii) (solely as the result of a final and non-appealable Order entered or issued by a Governmental Entity pursuant to any Railroad Law or Section 721), then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company in consideration of the Company disposing of its rights hereunder (other than those rights set out in Section 7.2), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company, a fee of $1,000,000,000 in cash (the “Regulatory Termination Fee”), free and clear and without withholding or deduction for Taxes unless such withholding or deduction is required by Law, with such payment to be made within three Business Days of such termination.

(iii)    If Parent is required, pursuant to the provisions of Part XIII of the CITA, to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from the Regulatory Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, Parent shall remit the full amount so withheld and deducted to the applicable Governmental Entity and Parent shall pay additional amounts to the Company (“Company Additional Amounts”) (such additional amounts to constitute additional proceeds for the disposition by the Company of its rights under this Agreement) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by the Company (including the Company Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction is not less than the amount the Company would have received if the Taxes had not been so withheld or deducted. Furthermore, without duplication of the foregoing sentence, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company from the full amount of any Taxes imposed on the Company under Part XIII of the CITA (together with any interest and penalties and expenses paid or payable by the Company with respect thereto) with respect to the receipt of the Regulatory Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, and Company Additional Amounts, other than Taxes in respect of which amounts have been fully deducted and remitted.

At Parent’s reasonable request and expense, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund from the applicable Canadian Governmental Entity of any Taxes in respect of which Parent has paid a Company Additional Amount or indemnified the Company (or, if such refund cannot be obtained, to claim a credit from the applicable Canadian or U.S. Governmental Entity for such Taxes). The Company shall promptly pay the amount of any such refund or credit obtained to Parent, net of any costs, Taxes and expenses borne by the Company with respect to such refund or credit; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment otherwise required pursuant to this sentence to the extent making such payment would place the Company in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification or Company Additional Amount and giving rise to such refund or credit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or Company Additional   -92-

Amount with respect to such Tax had never been paid. Parent and the Company agree: (i) to treat, for Canadian federal income Tax purposes, the payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee and/or the Parent Termination Fee and any Company Additional Amounts as being proceeds of disposition for the disposition by the Company of property consisting of its rights under this Agreement, and (ii) not to take any position inconsistent with such treatment, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. The obligations described in this paragraph will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 7.2 or this Section 7.3(b), on the payment by Parent of the Regulatory Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, and the Company Additional Amounts as and when required by this Section 7.3(b), none of Parent, either Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives shall have any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to the Company or its Affiliates or Representatives.

If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) or Section 7.1(d)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent, in return of $700,000,000 remitted to the Company by Parent in respect of the Company’s payment to CN of the “Company Termination Fee” (as defined in the CN Agreement) in connection with the termination of the CN Agreement and the execution of this Agreement pursuant to that certain offer letter, dated as of September 12, 2021, from Parent to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, an amount equal to $700,000,000 in cash (the “CN Termination Amount Refund”), free and clear and without withholding or deduction for Taxes, unless (A) Parent or the applicable Affiliate has failed to deliver to the Company a properly completed and duly executed IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form, in each case, establishing that the CN Termination Amount Refund is exempt from withholding or (B) such withholding or deduction is required by a change in Law after the date hereof (in which case the parties shall reasonably cooperate to minimize any such required withholding or deduction), with such payment to be made within three Business Days of such termination; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the CN Termination Amount Refund on more than one occasion. 


(d)    Acknowledgements. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without Section 7.3(a), Parent would not have entered into this Agreement and that, without Section 7.3(b), the Company would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, respectively, all fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including attorneys’ fees as well as expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated seeking such payment), together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Company Termination Fee, the CN Termination Amount Refund, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee   -93-

becomes payable by, and is paid by, the Company to Parent or Parent to the Company, as applicable, such Company Termination Fee and/or CN Termination Amount Refund, as applicable with respect to Parent, or such Parent Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable with respect to the Company, shall be the receiving party’s sole and exclusive remedy pursuant to this Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that none of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but is in consideration for a disposition of the rights of the recipient under this Agreement and represents liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances (which do not involve fraud or willful and material breach by the other party of this Agreement) in which the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties further acknowledge that the CN Termination Amount Refund shall not constitute a penalty, but is a refund and return of amounts previously remitted or caused to be remitted by Parent to the Company, and is payable as a consequence of the disposition of the rights of the recipient under this Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that the right to receive the Company Termination Fee, the CN Termination Amount Refund, the Parent Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not limit or otherwise affect any such party’s right to specific performance as provided in Section 8.5.

EXHIBIT A 


This VOTING TRUST AGREEMENT (“Trust Agreement”), dated as of [•], 2021, by and among Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, a Canadian corporation (“Parent”), Cygnus Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Holdco”) and David L. Starling (“Trustee” and, together with the Parent and Holdco, the “Parties” and each, a “Party”). 


W I T N E S S E T H : 


WHEREAS, it is intended that pursuant to, and upon the terms and conditions set forth in, the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [●], 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A), by and among Parent, Cygnus Merger Sub 1 Corporation, a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub 1”) , Cygnus Merger Sub 2 Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub 1 (“Merger Sub 2”) and Kansas City Southern, a Delaware corporation (“KCS”), (i) Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into KCS (the “First Merger”), (ii) immediately following the First Merger, KCS will merge with and into Merger Sub 1 (the “Second Merger”), with the entity surviving the Second Merger being referred to herein as the “Company” and (iii) immediately following the consummation of the Second Merger, Parent will cause the contribution of all of the outstanding common shares of the Company to Holdco in accordance with the steps set forth in Section 1.8 of the Merger Agreement (such contribution, the “Contribution”, and, together with the First Merger and the Second Merger, the “Merger”), as a result of which the Company will be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco; 


WHEREAS, it is intended that the consummation of the Merger will occur prior to any issuance by the Surface Transportation Board (the “STB”) of any required approval for, or exemption of, Parent’s control of the Company; 


WHEREAS, Parent intends, contemporaneously with the consummation of the Merger, to cause the deposit of all of the outstanding common shares of the Company in an independent, irrevocable voting trust (the “Trust”) pursuant to 49 C.F.R. Part 1013 and STB precedent, in order to avoid any allegation or assertion that Parent or any affiliate of Parent is controlling or has the power to control the Company prior to the receipt of any required STB approval or exemption; 


WHEREAS, the deposit of all of the outstanding common shares of the Company with the Trust is for the purpose of providing assurance that each of Holdco and the Parent will satisfy its absolute or contingent obligation under ICCTA and STB rules and precedents to avoid premature control of the Company pending STB review and approval of such control; 


WHEREAS, pursuant to Decision No. 5 (Docket No. FD 36500) of the STB, dated May 6, 2021, Parent has obtained the approval of the STB to deposit all outstanding shares of the Company into the Trust; 


WHEREAS, neither the Trustee nor any of its affiliates has any officers or board members in common or any direct or indirect business arrangements or dealings (as described in Paragraph 10 hereof) with Parent, Holdco, the Company or any of their affiliates;








________________


WHEREAS, the Trustee is willing to act as voting trustee pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the rules of the STB; and 


WHEREAS, Parent, Holdco and the Trustee intend that the Trust formed herein be a trust described in subsection 248(25.2) of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

2.    Deposit of Company Trust Stock. 


(a)    Immediately upon the completion of the Merger, Parent and Holdco agree that Holdco will deposit with the Trustee the certificate or certificates for all outstanding common shares of the Company (“Shares”).

All Shares at any time delivered to the Trustee hereunder are hereinafter called the “Trust Stock.” The Trustee shall present to the Company all certificates representing Trust Stock for surrender and cancellation of such certificates and for the issuance and delivery to the Trustee of new certificates registered in the name of the Trustee or its nominee. Parent, Holdco and the Trustee agree that the deposit of the Trust Stock with the Trustee pursuant to this Section 2 shall not result in a change in the beneficial ownership of the Shares and shall not result in a sale, disposition, lease or exchange with the Trustee of the Trust Stock. 


(b)    The Parties agree (i) to treat, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each beneficial owner of Trust Certificates as the beneficial owner of the underlying Trust Stock, (ii) not to take any position inconsistent with the treatment described in (i) on any tax return, in any tax proceeding or otherwise except to the extent required by a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and (iii) to treat, for Canadian federal income tax purposes, the trust created by this Trust Agreement as a trust described in subsection 248(25.2) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and to not take any position inconsistent with such treatment on any tax return, in any tax proceeding or otherwise. 


3.    Acquisition of Additional Shares or Securities. Parent agrees that immediately upon receipt, acquisition or purchase by it or any of its affiliates of any additional Shares, or any other voting securities of the Company, it will deposit or cause to be deposited to the Trustee the certificate or certificates representing such additional Shares or securities. 


4.    The Trustee’s Powers. 


(a)    The Trustee shall be present, in person or represented by proxy, at all annual and special meetings of shareholders of the Company so that all Trust Stock may be counted for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings. The Trustee shall be entitled and it shall be its duty to exercise any and all voting rights in respect of the Trust Stock   -2-

either in person or by proxy or consent, as hereinafter provided, unless otherwise directed by an order of the STB or a court of competent jurisdiction. Parent and Holdco agree, and the Trustee acknowledges, that the Trustee shall not participate in or interfere with the management of the Company and shall take no other actions with respect to the Company except in accordance with the terms hereof, the terms of the Merger Agreement, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any orders of the STB. The Trustee shall exercise all voting rights in respect of the Trust Stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or consistent with the effectuation of, the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In exercising the Trustee’s voting rights with respect to the Trust Stock, the Trustee shall vote in accordance with, and to maintain in effect, the terms and intent of the Merger Agreement and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, including, but not limited to, the following: the Trustee shall not sell, lease, assign, transfer, alienate, pledge, encumber or hypothecate the Trust Stock or any major assets of the Company or any right or interest therein, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or by gift or otherwise, nor shall the Trustee cause the Company to merge or consolidate with or into any other entity, without the prior written authorization of Parent (other than in connection with a disposition pursuant to Paragraph 9). In addition, until the STB has issued a final order approving the merger and common control of the Company by Parent, the Trustee shall vote all shares of Trust Stock to cause any other proposed merger, business combination or similar transaction (including, without limitation, any consolidation, sale of all or substantially all the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company) involving the Company, but not involving Parent or one of its affiliates (other than in connection with a disposition pursuant to Paragraph 9), not to be effected. The Trustee shall vote all shares of Trust Stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to dispose of Trust Stock in accordance with Paragraph 9 hereof. 


(b)    Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Trustee shall vote all shares of Trust Stock with respect to all matters, including, without limitation, the election or removal of directors, voted on by the stockholders of the Company (whether at a regular or special meeting or pursuant to a unanimous written consent) in the Trustee’s sole discretion, having due regard for the interests of the holders of the Trust Certificates as investors in the Company, determined without reference to such holders’ interests in railroads other than the Company or its subsidiaries; provided that the Trustee shall not vote the Trust Stock in favor of taking or doing any act which would violate any provision of the Merger Agreement (or impede the Company’s performance thereunder) or violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, or which if taken or done prior to the consummation of the Merger would have been a violation of the Merger Agreement or the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of KCS. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 4 or any other provision of this Agreement, the registered holder of a Trust Certificate may at any time — but only with the prior written approval of the STB — instruct the Trustee in writing to vote the Trust Stock represented by such Trust Certificate in any manner, in which case the Trustee shall vote such shares in accordance with such instructions. In exercising its voting rights in accordance with this Paragraph 4, the Trustee shall take such actions at all annual, special or other meetings of stockholders of the Company or in connection with any action by consent in lieu of a meeting. 


5.    Irrevocable Trust. This Agreement and the nomination of the Trustee during the term of the trust shall be irrevocable by Parent and its affiliates and shall terminate only in accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 9 and 15 hereof.   -3-

Subject to Paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b), the Trustee shall not exercise the voting powers of the Trust Stock in any way so as to create any dependence or intercorporate relationship between (i) Parent and its affiliates, on the one hand, and (ii) the Company or its affiliates, on the other hand. The term “affiliate” or “affiliates” wherever used in this Trust Agreement shall have the meaning specified in Section 11323(c) of Title 49 of the United States Code, as amended. The Trustee shall not, without the prior approval of the STB, vote the Trust Stock to elect any officer, director, nominee or representative of Parent or any of its affiliates as an officer or director of the Company or of any affiliate of the Company. The Trustee shall be kept informed with respect to the business operations of the Company by means of the financial statements prepared by the Company and any reports and other information when and as the Company would be required to file with the SEC by Sections 13(a) or 15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, if the Company were subject thereto, any other information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and other public disclosure documents periodically filed by the Company and affiliates of the Company with the STB, copies of which shall be promptly furnished to the Trustee by the Company, and such other periodic reports as the Trustee may request from time to time, and the Trustee shall be fully protected in relying upon such information. The Trustee shall not be liable for any mistakes of fact or law or any error of judgment, or for any act or omission, except as a result of the Trustee’s willful misconduct or gross negligence. 


7.    Transfer of Trust Certificates. All Trust Certificates shall be transferable on the books of the Trustee by the registered holder upon the surrender thereof properly assigned, in accordance with rules from time to time established for the purpose by the Trustee. Until so transferred, the Trustee may treat the registered holder as owner of the applicable Trust Certificates for all purposes. Each transferee of a Trust Certificate issued hereunder shall, by acceptance thereof, assent to and become a party to this Trust Agreement, and shall assume all attendant rights and obligations. 


8.    Dividends and Distributions. Pending the termination of this Trust as hereinafter provided, the Trustee shall, immediately following the receipt of each cash dividend or cash distribution as may be declared and paid upon the Trust Stock, pay the same over to or as directed the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee. The Trustee shall receive and hold dividends and distributions other than cash upon the same terms and conditions as the Trust Stock and shall issue Trust Certificates representing any new or additional securities that may be paid as dividends upon the Trust Stock or otherwise distributed upon the Trust Stock to the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates in proportion to their respective interests. 


9.    Disposition of Trust Stock; Termination of Trust. 


(a)    This Trust is accepted by the Trustee subject to the right hereby reserved in Parent at any time to cause Holdco to sell or make any other disposition of the whole or any part of the Trust Stock, whether or not an event described in subparagraph (b) below has occurred. The Trustee shall take all actions reasonably requested by Holdco with respect to (including, without limitation, exercising all voting rights in respect of Trust Stock in favor of any proposal or action necessary or desirable to effect, or consistent with the effectuation of) any proposed direct or indirect sale or other disposition of the whole or any part of the Trust Stock by Holdco.

Trustee shall at any time upon the receipt of a direction from Parent signed by its President and Chief Executive Officer or one of its authorized officers designating the person or entity to whom Parent has directly or indirectly sold or otherwise disposed of the whole or any part of the Trust Stock and certifying that such person or entity is not an affiliate of Parent and has all necessary regulatory authority, if any be required, to purchase the Trust Stock (upon which certification the Trustee shall be entitled to rely), immediately transfer to the person or entity therein named all the Trustee’s right, title and interest in such amount of the Trust Stock as may be set forth in said direction. If any regulatory authority or approval, including STB approval, is required for such transfer, Parent will not give any such direction unless and until such regulatory authority or approval is obtained. If the foregoing direction shall specify all of the Trust Stock, then following transfer of the Trustee’s right, title and interest therein, and in the event of a sale thereof, upon delivery to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates of the proceeds of such sale, this Trust shall cease and come to an end. If the foregoing direction is as to only a part of the Trust Stock, then this Trust shall cease as to said part upon such transfer, and distribution of the net proceeds therefrom in the event of sale, but shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining part of the Trust Stock. In the event of a direct or indirect sale of Trust Stock by Parent, the Trustee shall, to the extent the consideration therefor is payable to or controllable by the Trustee, promptly pay, or cause to be paid upon the order of Parent the net proceeds of such sale on a pro rata basis to the registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates. It is the intention of this paragraph that no violations of 49 U.S.C. Section 11323 will result from a termination of this Trust. 


(b)    In the event the STB Approval (as defined below) shall have been granted, then immediately upon the direction of Parent and the delivery of a certified copy of such order of the STB or other governmental authority with respect thereof, or, in the event that Subtitle IV of Title 49 of the United States Code, or other controlling law, is amended to allow Parent or its affiliates to acquire control of the Company without obtaining STB or other governmental approval, upon delivery of an opinion of independent counsel selected by the Trustee that no order of the STB or other governmental authority is required, the Trustee shall transfer to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee, its right, title and interest in and to all of the Trust Stock then held by it in accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements of this Trust Agreement and not theretofore transferred by it as provided in subparagraph (a) hereof, and upon such transfer this Trust shall cease and come to an end. 


(c)    In the event that there shall have been an STB Denial (as defined below), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, directly or indirectly, (i) sell the Trust Stock to one or more eligible purchasers, or (ii) otherwise dispose of the Trust Stock, during a period of two years after such STB Denial or such extension of that period as the STB shall approve. Any such disposition shall be subject to any jurisdiction of the STB to oversee Parent’s direct or indirect divestiture of Trust Stock. At all times, the Trustee shall continue to perform its duties under this Trust Agreement and, should Parent be unsuccessful in its efforts to directly or indirectly sell or distribute the Trust Stock during the period referred to, the Trustee shall as soon as practicable sell the Trust Stock for cash to one or more eligible purchasers in such manner and for such price as the Trustee in its discretion shall deem reasonable after consultation with the Parent. (An “eligible purchaser” hereunder shall be a person or entity that is not affiliated with the Parent and which has all necessary regulatory authority, if any be required, to purchase the Trust Stock.) Parent agrees to cooperate with the Trustee in effecting such disposition, and the Trustee agrees to act in   -5-








________________


accordance with any direction made by Parent as to any specific terms or method of disposition, to the extent not inconsistent with the requirements of the terms of any STB or court order. The proceeds of the sale shall be distributed on a pro rata basis to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee. The Trustee may, in its reasonable discretion, require the surrender to it of the Trust Certificates hereunder before paying to the holder its share of the proceeds. Upon disposition of the Trust Stock pursuant to this Paragraph 9(c), this Trust shall cease and come to an end. 


(d)    Unless sooner terminated pursuant to any other provision herein contained, this Trust Agreement shall terminate on December 31, 2025, and may be extended by the Parties hereto, so long as no violation of 49 U.S.C. Sections 11323 will result from such termination or extension. All Trust Stock and any other property held by the Trustee hereunder upon such termination shall be distributed on a pro rata basis to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee. The Trustee may, in its reasonable discretion, require the surrender to it of the Trust Certificates hereunder before the release or transfer of the stock interests evidenced thereby. 


(e)    The Trustee shall promptly inform the STB of any transfer or disposition of Trust Stock pursuant to this Paragraph 9. 


(f)    Except as provided in this Paragraph 9, the Trustee shall not dispose of, or in any way encumber, the Trust Stock. 


(g)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the STB issues a declaratory order that the termination of the Trust will not cause Parent or its affiliates to have control of the Company, the Trustee shall transfer on a pro rata basis to or upon the order of the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates hereunder as then known to the Trustee, its right, title and interest in and to all of the Trust Stock then held by it in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Trust Agreement and not theretofore transferred by it as provided in subparagraph (a) hereof, and this Trust shall cease and come to an end. The Trustee may, in its reasonable discretion, require the surrender to it of the Trust Certificates hereunder before the release or transfer of the Trust Stock evidenced thereby. 


(h)    As used in this Paragraph 9, the terms “STB Approval” and “STB Denial” shall have the following meanings: 


(i)    “STB Approval” means the issuance by the STB of a decision, which decision shall become effective and which decision shall not have been stayed or enjoined, that (A) constitutes a final agency action approving, exempting or otherwise authorizing the acquisition of control over the Company’s railroad operations by Parent and its affiliates, without the imposition of conditions that Parent, by written notice to the Trustee, has deemed to be unacceptable, and (B) does not require any change in the consideration paid or to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement or other material provisions thereof, or any change to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, unless Parent, by written notice to the Trustee, has determined any such change to be acceptable to Parent.   -6-








________________


(ii)    “STB Denial” means (A) STB Approval shall not have been obtained by December 31, 2023, or (B) the STB shall have, by an order which shall have become final and no longer subject to review by the courts, refused to approve the control referred to in clause (A) of the definition of STB Approval. 


10.    Independence of Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor any affiliate of the Trustee may have (a) any officers, or members of their respective boards or directors, in common with Parent or any of its affiliates, or (b) any direct or indirect business arrangements or dealings, financial or otherwise, with Parent or any of its affiliates, other than dealings pertaining to establishment and carrying out of this Trust. The Trustee hereby agrees that during the term of the Trust, the Trustee shall not own any stock or securities of Parent or any of its affiliates; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not prohibit the Trustee from owning any interest in any independently-managed diversified mutual fund that owns stock or securities of Parent and/or any of its affiliates. Neither Parent nor its affiliates shall purchase the stock or securities of the Trustee or any affiliate of the Trustee. 


11.    Compensation for Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive reasonable and customary compensation for all services rendered by it as Trustee under the terms hereof, and said compensation to the Trustee, together with all counsel fees, taxes, or other expenses reasonably incurred hereunder, shall be promptly paid by Parent. 


12.    Trustee May Act Through Agents. The Trustee may at any time or from time to time appoint an agent or agents and may delegate to such agent or agents the performance of any administrative duty of the Trustee and be entitled to reimbursement for the fees and expenses of such agents. 


13.    Responsibilities and Indemnification of the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be answerable for the default or misconduct of any agent or attorney appointed by it in pursuance hereof if such agent or attorney shall have been selected with reasonable care. The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be limited to those expressly set forth in this Trust Agreement. The Trustee shall be fully protected by acting in reliance upon any notice, advice, direction or other document or signature reasonably believed by the Trustee to be genuine. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the sufficiency or accuracy of the form, execution, validity or genuineness of the Trust Stock, or of any other documents, or of any endorsement thereon, or for any lack of endorsement thereon, or for any description therein, nor shall the Trustee be responsible or liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the persons executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver any such Trust Stock or other document or endorsement or this Trust Agreement, except for the execution and delivery of this Trust Agreement by this Trustee. Parent agrees that it will at all times protect, indemnify and save harmless the Trustee from any loss, damages, liability, cost or expense of any kind or character whatsoever in connection with this Trust, except those, if any, resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee, and will at all times undertake, assume full responsibility for, and pay on a current basis, but at least quarterly, all cost and expense of any suit or litigation of any character, whether or not involving a third party, including any proceedings before the STB, with respect to the Trust Stock or this Trust Agreement, and if the Trustee shall be made a party thereto, or be the subject of any investigation or proceeding (whether formal or informal), the Parent will pay all costs, damages and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, to which the Trustee may be subject by reason   -7-








________________


thereof; provided, however, that Parent shall not be responsible for the cost and expense of any suit that the Trustee shall settle without first obtaining Parent’s written consent. The indemnification obligations of Parent shall survive any termination of this Trust Agreement or the removal, resignation or other replacement of the Trustee. The Trustee may consult with counsel selected by it and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or omitted or suffered by the Trustee hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such opinion. 


14.    Trustee to Give Account to Holders. To the extent requested to do so by Parent, Holdco or any other registered holder of a Trust Certificate, the Trustee shall furnish to the Party making such request full information with respect to (a) all property theretofore delivered to it as Trustee, (b) all property then held by it as Trustee, and (c) all action theretofore taken by it as Trustee. 


15.    Resignation, Succession, Disqualification of Trustee. The Trustee, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may at any time resign by giving sixty days’ written notice of resignation to Parent, Holdco and the STB. Parent shall at least fifteen days prior to the effective date of such notice appoint a successor trustee which shall satisfy the requirements of Paragraph 10 hereof. If no successor trustee shall have been appointed and shall have accepted appointment at least fifteen days prior to the effective date of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any authority or court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee. Upon written assumption by the successor trustee of the Trustee’s powers and duties hereunder a copy of the assumption shall be delivered by the Trustee to Parent and to Holdco, and the STB and all registered holders of Trust Certificates shall be notified of such assumption, whereupon the Trustee shall be discharged of its powers and duties hereunder and the successor trustee shall become vested therewith. In the event of any material violation by the Trustee of the terms and conditions of this Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall become disqualified from acting as trustee hereunder as soon as a successor trustee shall have been selected in the manner provided by this paragraph. 


16.    Amendment. This Trust Agreement may from time to time be modified or amended by agreement executed by the Trustee, Parent, Holdco and any other registered holder(s) of the Trust Certificates (a) pursuant to an order of the STB, (b) with the prior approval of the STB, (c) in order to comply with any order of the STB, or (d) upon receipt of an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Trustee and the registered holder(s) of Trust Certificates that an order of the STB approving such modification or amendment is not required and that the amendment is authorized under the Merger Agreement and is consistent with the regulations of the STB regarding voting trusts. 


17.    Governing Law; Powers of the STB. 


(a)    THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF (OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION, except that, to the extent any provision hereof may be found inconsistent with the ICC Termination Act of 1995, as amended, (the “Act”) or regulation or decisions promulgated   -8-








________________


thereunder by the STB, such Act, decisions, and regulations shall control and such provision hereof shall be given effect only to the extent permitted by such Act and regulations. In the event that the STB shall, at any time hereafter by final order, find that compliance with law requires any other or different action by the Trustee than is provided herein, the Trustee shall act in accordance with such final order instead of the provisions of this Trust Agreement. 


(b)    Unless provided otherwise in the Act, each of the Parties agrees that: (i) it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Transactions”) exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division); provided that if the subject matter over the matter is the subject of the proceeding is vested exclusively in the United States federal courts, such proceeding shall be heard in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the “Chosen Courts”) and (ii) solely in connection with such proceedings, such Party (A) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (B) waives any objection to the laying of venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (C) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any Party, (D) consents to mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Paragraph 22 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof and (E) shall not assert as a defense, any matter or claim waived by the foregoing clauses (A) through (D) of this Section 17(b) or that any order issued by the Chosen Courts may not be enforced in or by the Chosen Courts. 


(c)    EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY BE IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISE OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND CERTIFIES (i) THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTIES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTIES WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS PARAGRAPH 17(c).   -9-

18.    Counterparts. This Trust Agreement is executed in three counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, and one of which shall be retained by Parent, one by Holdco, and the other by the Trustee. 


19.    Filing with the STB. A copy of this Agreement and any amendments or modifications thereto shall be filed with the STB by Parent. 


20.    Successors and Assigns. This Trust Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns to the Parties hereto, including without limitation successors to Parent by merger, consolidation or otherwise. 


21.    Successions of Functions. For purposes of this Trust Agreement, the term “Surface Transportation Board” or “STB,” includes any successor agency or governmental department that is authorized to carry out the responsibilities now carried out by the STB with respect to voting trusts and control of common carriers. 


22.    Notices. All notices, requests, instructions, consents, claims, demands, waivers, approvals and other communications to be given or made hereunder by one or more Parties to one or more of the other Parties shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made on the date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00 p.m. in the place of receipt and such day is a Business Day, as defined in the Merger Agreement (or otherwise on the next succeeding Business Day) if (a) served by personal delivery or by a nationally recognized overnight courier service upon the Party or Parties for whom it is intended, (b) delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested or (c) sent by email; provided that the email transmission is promptly confirmed by telephone or otherwise.

23.    Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each Party to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition to any other available remedies a Party may have in equity or at law, each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to obtain an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware without necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any action or proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.   -11-

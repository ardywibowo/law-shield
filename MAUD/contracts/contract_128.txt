At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 6.10(a), the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.   2.6          Directors and Officers.   (a)          Directors. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance therewith.   (b)         Officers. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the officers of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed in accordance therewith.   2.7          Effect on Capital Stock.   (a)          Capital Stock. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or by Parent and the applicable holder, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following Equity Interests, the following will occur:   (i)          each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such share of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of a share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;   21

(ii)         each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $330.00, without interest thereon, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Per Share Price”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11); and   (iii)         each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “Owned Company Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.   (b)         Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), consolidation of shares, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, subdivision, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock and the Company Equity Awards occurring on or after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time.   (c)          Statutory Rights of Appraisal.   (i)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price for each such Dissenting Company Share pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL subject to any required withholding of Taxes, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn, waived or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become cancelled and exchanged for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.   (ii)          Th e Company will give Parent (A) reasonably prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section 2.7(c)(ii), “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed material strategy and other material decisions with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not (or could not reasonably be expected to be) undermined or otherwise affected in any respect), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands (which may be rejected in the sole discretion of the Company) but will not be afforded any decision- making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth above.   22

2.8          Equity Awards.   (a)        Company RSU Awards . At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Company RSU Awards that are unexpired, unsettled, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as follows:   (i)           RSU Consideration. Each Company RSU Award (whether vested or unvested) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time, and shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “RSU Consideration”).   (b)         Company Options. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the Company Options that are unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as follows:   (i)          Option Consideration. Each Company Option (whether vested or unvested) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time, and shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the applicable per share exercise price under such Company Option, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, (the “Option Consideration”).   (ii)         Treatment of Certain Company Options . Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the per share exercise price of any Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Company Option shall be cancelled immediately upon the Effective Time pursuant to this Section 2.8(b)(ii) without payment or consideration.   23

(c)       Payment Procedures . The Surviving Corporation shall pay on the first (1st) payroll date that occurs on or after the Closing Date the aggregate RSU Consideration and Option Consideration, as applicable, net of any applicable withholding Taxes, payable with respect to each of the Company RSU Awards and Company Options through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation’s payroll (subject to any required tax withholdings) to the applicable holders of such Company RSU Award and Company Options.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company RSU Award or Company Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b)(i), as applicable, cannot be made through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, net of any applicable withholding Taxes, promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date).   (d)        Further Actions. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action necessary to effect the cancellation and exchange, as applicable, of Company Equity Awards upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). All Company Equity Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other Employee Plan or Contract providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company will be cancelled as of the Effective Time, and the Company will take all action necessary to effect the foregoing. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in any Company Equity Plan or other Employee Plan will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The Company shall provide to Parent or its counsel for review and approval drafts of any documentation prepared by the Company or its counsel to effectuate the foregoing and shall consider in good faith Parent’s comments thereto.   (e)         Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan . With respect to the Company’s 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended through October 24, 2018) (the “ESPP”), as soon as practicable following the Agreement Date, the Company Board will adopt resolutions or take all other actions as may reasonably be required to provide that (i) no new participants will commence participation in the ESPP as of the Agreement Date or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter; (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the ESPP as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, each individual participating in a Purchase Interval (as defined in the ESPP) in progress on the Agreement Date will not be permitted to (A) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect as of the Agreement Date; or (B) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the Agreement Date, except as may be required by applicable Law; and (iii) no new Purchase Interval will commence or be extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, after the Agreement Date.  If the Effective Time is expected to occur prior to the end of the current Purchase Interval, (I) the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to provide that the automatic exercise of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP shall occur in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by applying the accrued payroll deductions of each ESPP participant for such Purchase Interval to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock at a purchase price equal to eighty- five percent (85%) of the lower of (x) the Fair Market Value (as defined in the ESPP) per share of Company Common Stock on the participant’s Entry Date (as defined in the ESPP) into the then-current offering period and (y) the Fair Market Value (as defined in the ESPP) per share of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (II) the Company shall provide written notice to each ESPP participant, as required under the ESPP, at least ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, under which the ESPP participant may elect to terminate such ESPP participant’s purchase right under the ESPP until as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The ESPP will terminate, in accordance with its terms, no later than immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), and each share of Company Common Stock purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Price in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(ii), subject to withholding of any applicable withholding Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under the ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP, be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest).   24

2.9          Exchange of Certificates.   (a)          Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) designate the Company’s transfer agent o r such other bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.   (b)          Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than thirty (30) days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”), none of which, in each case, shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, none of the foregoing shall modify or otherwise affect the Per Share Price and Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit, replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund by wire transfer of immediately available funds so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make all payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Subject to the preceding sentence, any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.   25

(c)         Payment Procedures . Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (collectively, the “Certificates”); and (ii) subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.8(c), uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (collectively, the “Uncertificated Shares”) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as set forth in Section 2.11)); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as set forth in Section 2.11) will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (I) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificates as set forth in Section 2.11) by (II) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as set forth in Section 2.11) so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificates as set forth in Section 2.11) and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificates as set forth in Section 2.11) and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7.   26

(d)          DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Pacific Time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Pacific Time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first (1 st) Business Day after the Closing Date.   (e)        Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.   (f)          No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (g)         Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.  To the extent permitted by applicable Laws, any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders with respect to such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two (2) years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, shall become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.   27

2.10       No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificates as set forth in Section 2.11) or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificates as set forth in Section 2.11) or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   2.11        Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. I n the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of loss regarding that fact by the holder thereof (in customary form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent), the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable and customary amount (but in any event not to exceed the aggregate amount equal to the Per Share Price multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock which are the subject of the applicable affidavit made pursuant to this Section 2.11) as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   2.12      Required Withholding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and their Affiliates will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, or any other applicable Person, such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax laws.  Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority.  To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   2.13       No Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.   2.14        Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.   28

ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   With respect to any Section of this Article III, except (a) as disclosed in the reports, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in each case pursuant to the Exchange Act on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to the Agreement Date (other than any disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions “Risk Factors”, “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” or “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, solely to the extent such disclosures are general and predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, with regard to statements of historical fact)); or (b) subject to the terms of Section 9.12, as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on the Agreement Date (the “Company Disclosure Letter”), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   3.1        Organization; Good Standing. The Company (a) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and (b) has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of “good standing” is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Bylaws, each as amended as of the Agreement Date. The Company is not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws in any material respect.   3.2         Corporate Power; Enforceability. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b) perform its covenants and obligations hereunder; and (c) subject to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, consummate the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to creditors’ rights generally; and (B) is subject to general principles of equity (collectively, the “Enforceability Limitations”).   29

3.3          Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws.   (a)          Company Board Approval. The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement providing for the Merger in accordance with the DGCL upon the terms and subject to t h e conditions set forth herein; (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the execution and delivery thereof by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants, obligations and other agreements hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; (iii) directed that this Agreement and the Merger be submitted for approval and adoption by the stockholders of the Company; and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the “Company Board Recommendation”), which Company Board Recommendation has not been withdrawn, rescinded or modified in any way as of the Agreement Date.   (b)          Fairness Opinion. The Company Board has received the written opinion (or an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the “ Advisor”), to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the various factors, qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Price to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) in connection with the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (it being understood and agreed that such written opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub).   (c)          Anti-Takeover Laws .

(b)          Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter and organizational documents (including the Charter and the Bylaws) of the applicable Company Group Member and as provided in any indemnification agreements between any Company Group Member and said Indemnified Person, in each case, in effect prior to the Effective Time, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company Group or its Affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent), except that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Person’s entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.   (c)          D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company Group’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company Group for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect.   81

If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.   (e)          No Impairment.

Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if such person were a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with any Company Group Member; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).   ( f )          Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be joint and several.   ( g )          Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to any Company Group Member for any of its directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.   6.11        Employee Matters.   ( a )          Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.   82

(d)          New Plans.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Employee Plans) (such plans, collectively, the “New Plans” ) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces at the Effective Time coverage pursuant to a comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans” ) ; (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent waived under the corresponding Old Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying the applicable deductible, coinsurance, co-pay, offsets and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan to the same extent as such amounts were credited for the same purpose under the corresponding Old Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals (except to the extent that such limits or forfeitures applied under the Employee Plans in effect as of the Agreement Date).   83

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(i) will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor from any liability (I) for any fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement or (II) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for breaches (including any Willful Breach (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for actual and intentional common law fraud)) under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement), the Guaranty or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal to $365,000,000 plus the Enforcement Expenses and the Parent Reimbursement Obligations in the aggregate for all such breaches (the “Parent Liability Limitation”).

Other than the Guarantor’s obligations under the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than the Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger.   94

9 . 6          Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 6.10 and this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants, obligations and agreements set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by Section 6.10; and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and the Company Equity Awards to receive the Per Share Price as set forth in Article II. The provisions of Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2(b), Section 8.3(f), Section 8.4, Section 8.6, Section 9.3, Section 9.8, Section 9.9, Section 9.10, Section 9.11 and this Section 9.6 will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and assigns).  The provisions of Section 8.3(f) will inure to the benefit of the Company Related Parties and Parent Related Parties, each of whom is intended to be a third party beneficiary thereof.   9 . 7          Severability. I n the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.   9.8          Remedies.   ( a )          Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and payment of the Parent Termination Fee (and any related Enforcement Expenses pursuant to Section 8.3).   100

(b)          Specific Performance.   (i)          The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not timely perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the Guarantor under the Financing Letters in order to cause the Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Financing Letter) subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund a portion of the Required Amounts (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been, and continue to be, satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof if the Equity Financing is funded and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Company shall take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to consummate the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.   (ii)         The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.  Each Party further agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in seeking and agreeing to an expedited schedule in any litigation seeking an injunction or order of specific performance to attempt to fully resolve any dispute before the Termination Date.   9.9          Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.   101

9.10        Consent to Jurisdiction.   (a)          General Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions and the Guaranty, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) (collectively, the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.   ( b )          Jurisdiction for Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to Section 8.6, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, county of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in the Debt Commitment Letter will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed by, construed in accordance with and enforced under the laws of the State of New York.   102

9.11        WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR LITIGATION THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, VALIDITY OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS, IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS, THE GUARANTY, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (C) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.   9 . 1 2        Company Disclosure Letter References . The Parties agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.   9.13       Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one (1) or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one (1) and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.   9.14        No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.   103

9 . 1 5        Performance Guaranty. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings that are required to be performed, discharged or complied with following the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation.   9 . 1 6        Disclaimer. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole contractual benefit of such Parties. Such representations and warranties may be made as of specific dates, only for purposes of this Agreement and for the benefit of the Parties. Such representations and warranties are subject to important exceptions and limitations agreed upon by the Parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures, made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the Parties rather than establishing these matters as facts, and were made subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may differ from the standard generally applicable under federal securities laws or under other contracts. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 8.5 without notice or liability to any other Person. Any information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may have changed, and may continue to change, since the Agreement Date, and such subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public reports. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of contractual risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of such parties. Any filing of this Agreement with the SEC or otherwise is only to provide investors with information regarding its terms and conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding the Company or its business. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement or any description thereof as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the Agreement Date or as of any other date. The information in this Agreement should be considered together with the Company’s public reports filed with the SEC.   [Signature pages follow]   104

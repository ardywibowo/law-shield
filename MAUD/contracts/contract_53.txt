Treatment of Company Equity Awards . 


(d)  Treatment of Options.  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing between a holder of an Option (as defined below) and Parent, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares (an “Option”) granted under a Company Stock Plan shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become immediately vested and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Option to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.  For the avoidance of doubt, any Option which has a per Share exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment and shall have no further force or effect.

(f)  Treatment of Performance-Based Share Units.    Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing between a holder of a PSU (as defined below) and Parent, each outstanding performance-based share unit (any such arrangement, a “PSU”), granted under a Company Stock Plan shall automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become immediately vested and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such PSU to receive (without interest), at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of Shares subject to such PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, calculated based on the greater of (A) actual

  performance achieved in accordance with the terms of such PSU and this Section 2.2(c), and (B) target level performance over the entire performance period,  multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For purposes of measuring actual performance as described in clause (A) of the preceding sentence, (i) any performance measures related to total shareholder return shall be calculated by, first, determining the volume weighted average closing trading price of the Company’s (or relevant peer group’s) common stock over the thirty trading days commencing on the first trading day occurring after the date of public announcement of this Agreement, and then, second, using such average prices as the “ending prices” for purposes of calculating relative total shareholder return (with the resulting relative total shareholder return calculations as of the last day of such thirty trading day period being substituted as the total shareholder return criteria for such PSU) and (ii) any performance measures related to goals other than total shareholder return shall be calculated based on extrapolation of the actual performance results achieved through the Effective Time as applied to the duration of the relevant performance periods, with such extrapolation calculations to be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and subject to Parent’s review prior to the Effective Time in good faith and consistent with past practice. 


(g)  Cancellation of Company Equity Awards.    For the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise agreed to in writing,  following the Effective Time, no Option, Share Unit or PSU that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of any Option, Share Unit or PSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration (if any) in exchange for such Option, Share Unit or PSU set forth in Section 2.2(a),  Section 2.2(b) and Section 2.2(c). 


(h)  Corporate Actions.  At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary or required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.2 and shall take all actions necessary to terminate each Company Stock Plan as of the Effective Time without any ongoing liability to Parent. 


(i)  Required Payments.

  to such holder (less applicable withholding taxes), which check shall be sent by courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such amounts relate to a Company Equity Award that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company and/or the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Company Equity Award that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(j)  Paying Agent.    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company’s prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, to act as agent for the shareholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) to receive payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to which the shareholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a).    Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”) in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares that will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a).  With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall not be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the Per Share Merger Consideration that would be payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares if such Dissenting Shares were not Dissenting Shares.    The Paying Agent shall not invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund unless otherwise directed by Parent;  provided that any such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months.  To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 2.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent.  The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) shall not be used for any purpose other than as contemplated by this Section 2.3(a).

  (i)  Transmittal Materials.  Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, if any (“Certificates”), and each former holder of record of Shares held in book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) (other than holders of Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal in customary form as agreed by the Parties, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon proper delivery of an “agent’s message” regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), such transmittal materials to be in such form and to have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. 


(ii)  Certificates.    Upon surrender of one or more Certificates to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials and instructions as contemplated in Section 2.3(b)(i), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, each holder of record of one or more Certificates, if any, shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Shares represented by such Certificates by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.  No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. 


(iii)  Book-Entry Shares.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to deliver a Certificate to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to pursuant to this Article II.    In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such “agent’s message” or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Shares represented by such Book-Entry Shares by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.  No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares.

  (iv)  Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, are registered, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, formerly representing such Shares are properly presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.     


(v)  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (together, if applicable, with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration. 


(l)  Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former holders of Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand.  Any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) upon delivery of evidence of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(b), and the Surviving Corporation shall remain responsible for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of such holder’s claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(m)  Transfers.  From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  presented, and acceptable, to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this Article II, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)).  The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificates or receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message”, if applicable, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Article II, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.  


(n)  Lost Certificates.  In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stole or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such customary terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(f)) equal to the amount the holder of such Certificate is entitled to as set forth in this Article II. 


(o)  Withholding Rights.  Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (and any agent or Affiliate thereof) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to any recipient of payments hereunder such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 


Appraisal Rights .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the OGCL (but only to the extent required thereby) any Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have not voted such Shares in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and who are entitled to and have properly demanded dissenters rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and otherwise have complied in all respects with, Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and have not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise irrevocably lost or failed to perfect such Person’s right to appraisal or payment under the OGCL, at which time such Shares shall thereupon be automatically converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to Section 2.3(f), and such Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof shall cease to have any other rights with respect to such Shares.  Each Dissenting Share shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive only the payment of the fair cash value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the

  provisions of, and as provided by, Section 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to perfect such Person’s right to appraisal or payment under the OGCL.  The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands, and any other written demand, notice, withdrawal or instrument pursuant to applicable Law that are received by or delivered to the Company relating to shareholders’ rights of appraisal or to such demands or withdrawals and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or compromise, or settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to comply with the provisions under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.  


Adjustments .

Further Assurances .

  Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and Parent will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid as and when they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date.  As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto.  There are no conditions precedent or other requirements related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing (including pursuant to any “market flex” provisions in the fee letter or otherwise), other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof.  As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Financing Commitments or (iii) result in any portion of the amount to be provided or funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments being unavailable on the Closing Date.  As of the date hereof, assuming each of the conditions to Closing set forth herein are satisfied and the Marketing Period has been completed, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that the amount of the Financing necessary to fund the Financing Uses will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date and, as of the date hereof, Parent is not aware of the existence of any fact or event that would or would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions to the Financing not to be satisfied or the amount of the Financing necessary to fund the Financing Uses not to be made available to Parent in full on the Closing Date. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments, Parent will have on the Closing Date funds sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and the other payments under Article II, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Commitments and (iv) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation contemplated hereunder that are required to be paid on the Closing Date (clauses (i) through (iv), the “Financing Uses”).  Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtain the Debt Financing or any other financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Section 4.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth the true and correct amount of existing third party debt for borrowed money outstanding under (i) the Existing Borrower First Lien Credit Agreement, (ii) the Existing Borrower Second Lien Credit Agreement, (iii) each Existing Chameleon First Lien Credit Agreement and (iv) the Existing Chameleon Second Lien Credit Agreement, respectively, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the net proceeds of the Existing Chameleon Second Lien Credit Agreement are held as cash on hand by Chameleon. 


Ownership of Shares .  None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Shares or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Shares, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Shares, or any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, swap agreement or other security, contract right or derivative position,

  whether or not presently exercisable, that provides Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates or subsidiaries with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the value of the Shares or a value determined in whole or part with reference to, or derived in whole or part from, the value of the Shares, in any case without regard to whether (i) such derivative conveys any voting rights in such securities to such Person or such Person’s Affiliates, (ii) such derivative is required to be, or capable of being, settled through delivery of securities or (iii) such Person or such Person’s Affiliates may have entered into other transactions that hedge the economic effect of such derivative. 


Vote/Approval Required .  No vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent, Chameleon or any of their respective Affiliates (other than Merger Sub) is necessary to approve this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

Solvency .

Certain Arrangements .  As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates has entered into any contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation, arrangement, understanding or undertaking, whether written or oral, with any shareholder of the Company or any member of the Company’s management or directors that is related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to the management of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time.

  Company or any of its subsidiaries or serving in such capacity at the request thereof, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under Ohio Law and its Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding  to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the Articles of Incorporation, the Code of Regulations or the certificate of incorporation, articles of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any subsidiary; provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10); provided further that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officer’s or director’s conduct complies with the standards set forth under Ohio Law and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation, but otherwise qualifying under Section 1701.13(e)(4) of the OGCL.  In the event of any such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.    In the event any Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party under this Section 6.10,  (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such Proceeding, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Party promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such Proceeding, and (iv) no Indemnified Party shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent. 


(z)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.10, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying Party. 


(aa)  The provisions in the Surviving Corporation’s articles of incorporation and code of regulations with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be no less favorable to such directors and officers than such provisions contained in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance; provided,  however, that after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay in the aggregate for such coverage under each such policy more than 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto under each such policy, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.  In the event the Company elects to purchase such a “tail policy”, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail policy” in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder.    If the Company elects not to purchase such a “tail policy”, then Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and from insurance carriers having at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

(ff)  Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof but taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments (including complying with any request requiring the exercise of so-called “market flex” provisions in the fee letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitments, (B) negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto) or on terms that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto), in each case, which terms shall not in any respect expand on, or add to, the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing at the Closing or reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing available to be funded at the Closing below the amount required to fund the Financing Uses; provided that, without expanding on or adding to the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing at the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to increase the total amount of Debt Financing (such definitive agreements, the “Definitive Financing Agreements”) and (C) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent or Merger Sub in the Financing Commitments and such Definitive Financing Agreements that are to be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing if all conditions to the Financing are then satisfied.  Parent shall obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Financing Commitment upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing).  Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing and Parent shall promptly respond to any request from the Company concerning such status.  Upon reasonable prior written request, Parent shall provide the Company with copies of any final Definitive Financing Agreements and such other material information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall be reasonably necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such financing activities. 


(gg)  In the event that Parent becomes aware that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto) contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts and as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such event, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from the same or alternative Debt Financing Sources in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is and remains available to Parent, together with cash on hand at Parent and its subsidiaries, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all Financing Uses (“Alternative Financing”) and to obtain and provide the Company with a copy of, the new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative

  Financing (the “Alternative Financing Commitment Letter”), which Alternative Financing Commitment Letter will not (i) include terms and conditions (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto) that are materially less beneficial to Parent than those contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto) or involve (or expand upon) any conditions to funding of the Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt Financing Commitments or (ii) reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede, or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that such reasonable best efforts shall not require Parent to pay more fees, OIDs or incur an increase in pricing than the pricing terms of the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof, taking into account “market flex” terms. In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but any bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 6.11(b)) are available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (or replacements thereof), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated Debt Financing as promptly as practicable. As applicable, references in this Agreement (other than with respect to representations in this Agreement made by Parent that speak as of the date hereof) (i) to Financing or Debt Financing shall include Alternative Financing, (ii) to Financing Commitments or Debt Financing Commitments shall include the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter and (iii) to Definitive Financing Agreements shall include the definitive documentation relating to any such Alternative Financing.  Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with any portion of the Alternative Financing necessary to fund the Financing Uses. 


(hh)  Without limiting the generality of Section 6.11(b), Parent shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day) notify the Company in writing of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) termination, withdrawal, repudiation, rescission, cancellation or expiration of any Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement , (ii) any actual breach or default under any Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement by any party to such Debt Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement and (iii) receipt by any of Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual, threatened or alleged breach, default, termination, withdrawal, rescission or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement or any provision of any provision of any Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement (including any proposal by any Debt Financing Source, lender or other Person to withdraw, terminate, repudiate, rescind or make a material change in the terms of (including the amount of Financing contemplated) any Financing Commitment) or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement or (iv) if for any reason Parent in good faith believes that it is reasonably likely that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the Definitive Financing Agreements.  As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days, Parent shall provide to the Company and its Representatives any and all information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this Section 6.11(c).

  words “without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “herein,” “hereby” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.    All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein.    Words of any gender include each other gender and neuter genders and words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively.    Any Contract or Law defined or referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts) by waiver or consent and (in the case of Laws) by succession or comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.    The word “or” shall means “and/or”.    With respect to the determination of any period of time, “from” means “from and including”.    The word “will” shall be construed to have the same meaning as the word “shall”.    Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified.    The word “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”.

If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if it is drafted by all the Parties and without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the Party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

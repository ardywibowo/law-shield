AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 4, 2021 (this “Agreement”), by and between SVB Financial Group, a Delaware corporation (“SVB Financial”), and Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“Boston Private”).   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of SVB Financial and Boston Private have approved the entry into this Agreement and determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which Boston Private will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into SVB Financial (the “Merger”), so that SVB Financial is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Corporation”) in the Merger;   WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and   WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I    THE MERGER   1.1          The Merger.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and the Massachusetts Business Corporations Act (the “MBCA”), at the Effective Time, Boston Private shall merge with and into SVB Financial.  SVB Financial shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Boston Private shall terminate.   1.2          Closing.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place (a) by electronic exchange of documents at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first business day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which all of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof have been satisfied or waived at least three (3) business days before the end of such month (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), and if all such conditions are satisfied or waived within the last three (3) business days of a calendar month, then on the first business day of the second succeeding calendar month; or (b) at such other date, time or place as SVB Financial and Boston Private may mutually agree in writing after all of such conditions have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof).  The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date.”








________________


1.3          Effective Time.  On or (if agreed by SVB Financial and Boston Private) prior to the Closing Date, SVB Financial and Boston Private, respectively, shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) with the Delaware Secretary of State (the “Delaware Secretary”) and articles of merger (the “Articles of Merger”) with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Massachusetts Secretary”).  The Merger shall become effective at such time as specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and MBCA, or at such other time as shall be provided by applicable law (such time hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”).   1.4          Effects of the Merger.  At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the MBCA and this Agreement.   1.5          Conversion of Boston Private Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of SVB Financial, Boston Private or the holder of any of the following securities:   (a)    Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Boston Private issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Boston Private Common Stock”), except for shares of Boston Private Common Stock owned by Boston Private as treasury stock or otherwise owned by Boston Private or SVB Financial (in each case other than shares of Boston Private Common Stock (i) held in any Boston Private Benefit Plans or related trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties and (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, in respect of debts previously contracted (collectively, the “Exception Shares”)), shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive, without interest, (i) 0.0228 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of SVB Financial (the “SVB Financial Common Stock”) and (ii) $2.10 in cash (the “Per Share Cash Consideration”) (the consideration described in clauses (i) and (ii), the “Merger Consideration”).   -2-








________________


(b)   All the shares of Boston Private Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an “Old Certificate”, it being understood that any reference herein to “Old Certificate” shall be deemed to include reference to book‑entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Boston Private Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of Boston Private Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of a fractional share which the shares of Boston Private Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2, without any interest thereon.  Old Certificates previously representing shares of Boston Private Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates or, at SVB Financial’s option, evidence of shares in book- entry form (collectively referred to herein as “New Certificates”), representing whole shares of SVB Financial Common Stock and cash as set forth in Section 1.5(a) (together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon.  If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Boston Private Common Stock or SVB Financial Common Stock shall have been, in accordance with Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.3(b), respectively, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, and to the Merger Consideration, to give holders of Boston Private Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   (c)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Boston Private Common Stock that are owned by Boston Private or SVB Financial (in each case other than the Exception Shares) or by any direct or indirect Boston Private Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   1.6          SVB Financial Common Stock.  At and after the Effective Time, each share of SVB Financial Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.   1.7          Treatment of Boston Private Equity Awards.   (a)    At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Boston Private Common Stock that is not a Boston Private Performance-Based Stock Option (a “Boston Private Stock Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option (a “SVB Financial Stock Option”) to purchase that number of whole shares of SVB Financial Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Boston Private Common Stock subject to such Boston Private Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the Boston Private Equity Award Exchange Ratio (as defined below in Section 1.7(f)) with an exercise price per share of Boston Private Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (x) the exercise price per share of Boston Private Common Stock of such Boston Private Stock Option divided by (y) the Boston Private Equity Award Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that the exercise price and the number of shares of SVB Financial Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Boston Private Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; provided, further, that in the case of any Boston Private Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of SVB Financial Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.  Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.7(a), each such SVB Financial Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as applied to the corresponding Boston Private Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.   -3-








________________


(b)   At the Effective Time, each performance-based stock option award in respect of shares of Boston Private Common Stock (a “Boston Private Performance-Based Stock Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, subject to requisite consent by the holder thereof, be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.   (c)    At the Effective Time, each time-based restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Boston Private Common Stock (a “Boston Private RSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a restricted stock unit award (a “SVB Financial RSU Award”) in respect of that number of shares of SVB Financial Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Boston Private Common Stock subject to the Boston Private RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Boston Private Equity Award Exchange Ratio.  Each such SVB Financial RSU Award shall be settleable in shares of SVB Financial Common Stock.  Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.7(c), each such SVB Financial RSU Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) as applied to the corresponding Boston Private RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (d)   At the Effective Time, each performance-based restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Boston Private Common Stock (a “Boston Private Performance-Based RSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a SVB Financial RSU Award in respect of that number of shares of SVB Financial Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Boston Private Common Stock subject to the Boston Private Performance-Based RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Boston Private Common Stock determined based on the greater of target and actual performance for the portion of the performance period through the Effective Time as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the Boston Private Board of Directors (the “Boston Private Compensation Committee”) consistent with past practice multiplied by (ii) the Boston Private Equity Award Exchange Ratio.  Each such SVB Financial RSU Award shall be settleable in shares of SVB Financial Common Stock.  Except as specifically provided in this Section 1.7(d), each such SVB Financial RSU Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including service-based vesting terms) as applied to the corresponding Boston Private Performance-Based RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.   -4-








________________


(e)    At or prior to the Effective Time, Boston Private, the Board of Directors of Boston Private or the Boston Private Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.7.  As of the Effective Time, the number and kind of shares available for issuance under each equity incentive plan of Boston Private shall be adjusted to reflect SVB Financial Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable plan.  SVB Financial shall take all corporate actions that are necessary for the assumption of the Boston Private Equity Awards pursuant to Section 1.7(a) through 1.7(d), including the reservation, issuance and listing of SVB Financial Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.7.  As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, SVB Financial shall file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of SVB Financial Common Stock underlying such Boston Private Equity Awards, and shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such assumed Boston Private Equity Awards remain outstanding.   (f)    For purposes of this Agreement, “Boston Private Equity Award Exchange Ratio” means the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the Per Share Cash Consideration by (II) the SVB Financial Share Closing Price (as defined below in Section 2.2(e)).   1.8          Treatment of Boston Private ESPP.  The right to acquire shares of Boston Private Common Stock under the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (the “Boston Private ESPP”) is not a Boston Private Stock Option for purposes of this Agreement.  No Offering (as defined in the Boston Private ESPP) shall be commenced for a period after December 31, 2020.   1.9          Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation.  At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of SVB Financial (the “SVB Financial Certificate”), as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and applicable law.   1.10        Bylaws of Surviving Corporation.  At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of SVB Financial (the “SVB Financial Bylaws”), as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.   1.11        Tax Consequences.  It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.   -5-

1.12        Bank Merger.  Following the Merger, Boston Private Bank & Trust Company (“Boston Private Bank”), a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Boston Private, will merge (the “Bank Merger”) with and into Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB Bank”), a California- chartered commercial bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of SVB Financial, pursuant to an agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (with such reasonable changes as specified by SVB Financial), which agreement shall be entered into by SVB Bank and Boston Private Bank promptly after the date of this Agreement (the “Bank Merger Agreement”).  SVB Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Boston Private Bank shall cease.  Prior to the Effective Time, Boston Private shall cause Boston Private Bank, and SVB Financial shall cause SVB Bank, to execute the Bank Merger Agreement and such certificates or articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (“Bank Merger Certificates”) following the Effective Time.   ARTICLE II    EXCHANGE OF SHARES   2.1          SVB Financial to Make Shares Available.  At or prior to the Effective Time, SVB Financial shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by SVB Financial and reasonably acceptable to Boston Private (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) New Certificates to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Boston Private Common Stock, and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by SVB Financial, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to SVB Financial.   -6-

2.2          Exchange of Shares.   (a)    As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) days thereafter, SVB Financial shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Boston Private Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of SVB Financial Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and the cash portion of the Merger Consideration which the shares of Boston Private Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b).  From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of SVB Financial Common Stock to which such holder of Boston Private Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the cash portion of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (C) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash portion of the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.   -7-








________________


(b)   No dividends or other distributions declared (if any) with respect to SVB Financial Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II.  After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of SVB Financial Common Stock which the shares of Boston Private Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.   (c)    If any New Certificate representing shares of SVB Financial Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of SVB Financial Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Boston Private of the shares of Boston Private Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this Article II.   -8-








________________


(e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of SVB Financial Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to SVB Financial Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of SVB Financial.  In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, SVB Financial shall pay to each former shareholder of Boston Private who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of SVB Financial Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date (the “SVB Financial Share Closing Price”) by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of SVB Financial Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5.  The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.   (f)    Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Boston Private for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation.  Any former shareholders of Boston Private who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the SVB Financial Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Boston Private Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of SVB Financial, Boston Private, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Boston Private Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  SVB Financial and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books and records of Boston Private to establish the identity of those entitled to receive shares of SVB Financial Common Stock or any other amounts issuable or payable in accordance with this Agreement, which books and records shall be conclusive with respect thereto.   (g)    SVB Financial shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SVB Financial Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Boston Private Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by SVB Financial or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Boston Private Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by SVB Financial or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.   -9-

Boston Private has the corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects.  Boston Private is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Boston Private.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to SVB Financial, Boston Private or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) changes, after the date hereof, resulting from hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, floods or other natural disasters or from any outbreak of any disease or other public health event (including the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of the Pandemic Measures), (E) public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood and agreed that this clause (E) shall not apply with respect to any representation or warranty that is intended to address the consequences of the execution, announcement or performance of this Agreement or consummation of the Merger) or (F) the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or financial forecasts, but not including the underlying causes thereof; except, with respect to subclause (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change are disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to similar companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate); or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Boston Private (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and (f), respectively, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) to ensure that material information relating to Boston Private, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Boston Private by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Boston Private’s outside auditors and the audit committee of Boston Private’s Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Boston Private’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Boston Private’s internal controls over financial reporting.

6.3           Boston Private Shareholder Approval. 


(a)    Boston Private shall call a meeting of its shareholders (the “Boston Private Meeting”) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Boston Private Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to approve a merger agreement.  Boston Private shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable.  Such meeting may be held virtually, subject to applicable law and the organizational documents of Boston Private.  The Board of Directors of Boston Private shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Boston Private the Requisite Boston Private Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its unqualified recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the Boston Private Board of Directors shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify such recommendation in a manner adverse to SVB Financial, or resolve to do so, (ii) fail to reaffirm such recommendation within ten (10) business days after SVB Financial requests in writing that such action be taken, (iii) fail to publicly and without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm the board recommendation within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Boston Private Meeting) after an Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by SVB Financial to do so, (iv) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.  Boston Private shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to SVB Financial to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Requisite Boston Private Vote.  However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Boston Private, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of Boston Private may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Boston Private may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided, that the Board of Directors of Boston Private may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) Boston Private shall have complied in all material respects with Section 6.9; (ii) if such actions are taken in response to an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal, the Boston Private Board of Directors shall have concluded in good faith, after giving effect to all the adjustments which may be offered by SVB Financial pursuant to clause (iv) below, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (iii) Boston Private shall notify SVB Financial, at least four (4) business days in advance, of the intention of the Boston Private Board of Directors to change its recommendation (including, in the event such change in recommendation is in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal and furnish to SVB Financial all the material terms and conditions of such proposal to the extent not previously provided pursuant to Section 6.9, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances if such change in recommendation is not in response to an Acquisition Proposal); and (iv) prior to effecting a change in the recommendation of the Boston Private Board of Directors, Boston Private shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period following Boston Private’s delivery of the notice referred to in clause (iii) above, negotiate with SVB Financial in good faith for a period of up to four (4) business days (to the extent SVB Financial desires to negotiate) to allow SVB Financial to propose such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that an Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (ii) above ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or so that it would no longer more likely than not result in a violation of the Boston Private Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement.  Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3.

(c)    Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by SVB Financial in writing no later than 14 days prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, Boston Private shall cause Boston Private’s tax-qualified defined contribution plan (the “Boston Private 401(k) Plan”) to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, contingent on the occurrence of the Effective Time.  In the event that SVB Financial requests that the Boston Private 401(k) Plan be terminated, Boston Private shall provide SVB Financial with evidence that such Boston Private 401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable approval by SVB Financial) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 


(d)    In the event that SVB Financial requests that the Boston Private 401(k) Plan be terminated, prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable), (i) Boston Private and SVB Financial shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the Boston Private 401(k) Plan and/or the tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan designated by SVB Financial (the “SVB Financial 401(k) Plan”) to permit such Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing Employee (including the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing loans) from the Boston Private 401(k) Plan to the SVB Financial 401(k) Plan and (ii) each Continuing Employee shall become a participant in the SVB Financial 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date (giving effect to the service crediting provisions of Section 6.5(b)); it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan.  Boston Private and SVB Financial shall cooperate to take any and all commercially reasonable actions needed to permit each Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Boston Private 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Boston Private 401(k) Plan after the Effective Time, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the notes evidencing such loans from the Boston Private 401(k) Plan to the SVB Financial 401(k) Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, so as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans.

(f)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.10, prior to Boston Private making any broad-based written or material oral communications to the managers, officers or employees of Boston Private or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to the consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to compensation or benefit matters, Boston Private shall provide SVB Financial with a copy of the intended communication, SVB Financial shall have two business days to review and comment on the communication, and Boston Private shall consider any such comments in good faith; provided, however, that Boston Private shall not be required to provide to SVB Financial a copy of any communication that is materially consistent with a communication previously reviewed by SVB Financial.  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of Boston Private or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, Boston Private, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Boston Private, SVB Financial or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Boston Private or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Boston Private Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of SVB Financial, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Boston Private Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time.  Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Boston Private or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement (except as set forth in Section 6.6).

(a)    From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee of Boston Private and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Boston Private Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, or employee of Boston Private or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and SVB Financial and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Boston Private Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Boston Private pursuant to the Boston Private Articles of Organization, Boston Private’s Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Boston Private Subsidiary and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof that have been disclosed to SVB Financial; provided that the Boston Private Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Boston Private Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b)    Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Boston Private (provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Boston Private or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Boston Private for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.  In lieu of the foregoing, Boston Private, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of SVB Financial, may (and at the request of SVB Financial, Boston Private shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year “tail” policy under Boston Private’s existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap. 


(c)    The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Boston Private Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.  If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

6.8           Advice of Changes.  SVB Financial and Boston Private shall each promptly advise the other party of any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on such first party, or (ii) that such first party believes would or would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.8 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

6.9           Acquisition Proposals. 


(a)    Boston Private shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their agents, advisors and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) publicly propose any of the foregoing or propose any of the foregoing to a third party; provided, that, prior to receipt of the Requisite Boston Private Vote, in the event Boston Private receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to or concurrently with providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Boston Private shall have provided such information to SVB Financial, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Boston Private.  Boston Private will, will cause its officers and directors to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its agents, advisors and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than SVB Financial with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.  Boston Private will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours and before entering into any discussions or providing any information) advise SVB Financial following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will provide SVB Financial with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise SVB Financial of any related material developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.  Boston Private shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.  Boston Private shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.9(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.  As used in this Agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” means, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Boston Private and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Boston Private or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Boston Private, (ii) any tender offer (including a self tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Boston Private or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Boston Private, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving Boston Private or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Boston Private.  As used in this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Boston Private concludes in good faith to be more favorable to its shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors, (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law; provided, that for purposes of the definition of “Superior Proposal,” the reference to “25%” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall instead refer to “50%”.

(b)    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Boston Private or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to Boston Private’s shareholders; provided, that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 


6.10         Public Announcements.  Boston Private and SVB Financial shall each use their reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, or in connection with a change in recommendation by Boston Private in accordance with Section 6.3, Boston Private and SVB Financial agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 


6.11         Change of Method.  SVB Financial may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger, and Boston Private agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as SVB Financial may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to Boston Private’s shareholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed. 


6.12         Restructuring Efforts.  If Boston Private shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Boston Private Vote at the duly convened Boston Private Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (provided, however, that no party shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement or (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to Boston Private’s shareholders) and/or (in the case of Boston Private) resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.12) to its shareholders for approval. 


6.13         Takeover Statutes.  Neither Boston Private nor its Board of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and Boston Private and its Board of Directors shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect.  If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, Boston Private and the members of its Board of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

Boston Private and SVB Financial agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of Boston Private subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the “Boston Private Insiders”), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Boston Private Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Boston Private Common Stock and Boston Private Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.14.  The Board of Directors of SVB Financial and of Boston Private, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of Boston Private Common Stock or Boston Private Equity Awards and (ii) any acquisitions of SVB Financial Common Stock and/or SVB Financial Stock Options and/or SVB Financial RSU Awards in respect of Boston Private Equity Awards converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Article I, in each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by any Boston Private Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation or SVB Financial subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Boston Private shall give SVB Financial the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against Boston Private and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without SVB Financial’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 


6.16         Trust Preferred Securities.  Upon the Effective Time, SVB Financial or a Subsidiary of SVB Financial shall assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Boston Private under the (i) Indenture, between Boston Private and SunTrust Bank, as debenture trustee, dated October 12, 2004 and (ii) Indenture, between Boston Private and Wilmington Trust Company, as debenture trustee, dated September 27, 2005 (the “Trust Preferred Securities”), and the due and punctual payments of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Trust Preferred Securities.

With respect to each such Private Fund, Boston Private shall, and shall cause the applicable Boston Private Subsidiary to, request from each holder of the ownership interests of such Private Fund written consent to commence the liquidation and dissolution of such Private Fund in accordance with such Private Fund’s certificate of partnership and limited partnership agreement (or comparable documents), the applicable Advisory Agreement and applicable law; provided, that any such commencement of liquidation and dissolution shall be effective at or after the Closing and, if requested by Boston Private, be made conditional on the Closing.

(b)    by either SVB Financial or Boston Private if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 


(c)    by either SVB Financial or Boston Private if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before January 3, 2022 (the “Termination Date”), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 


(d)    by either SVB Financial or Boston Private (provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Boston Private, in the case of a termination by SVB Financial, or SVB Financial, in the case of a termination by Boston Private, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by SVB Financial, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by Boston Private, as the case may be, and which is not cured within the earlier of the Termination Date and 45 days following written notice to Boston Private, in the case of a termination by SVB Financial, or SVB Financial, in the case of a termination by Boston Private, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period; or

(b)    (i)         In the event that after the date of this Agreement a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of Boston Private or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Boston Private and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either SVB Financial or Boston Private pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and Boston Private shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Boston Private Vote at the duly convened Boston Private Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the approval of this Agreement was taken or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by SVB Financial pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Boston Private enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Boston Private shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay SVB Financial, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $36,000,000 (the “Termination Fee”); provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “25%” shall instead refer to “50%”.

(c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other party’s fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement, the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by Boston Private under this Section 8.2 shall be equal to the Termination Fee.  In no event shall Boston Private be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 


(d)    Each of SVB Financial and Boston Private acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Boston Private fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, SVB Financial commences a suit which results in a judgment against Boston Private for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Boston Private shall pay the costs and expenses of SVB Financial (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.  In addition, if Boston Private fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then Boston Private shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” (as announced by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

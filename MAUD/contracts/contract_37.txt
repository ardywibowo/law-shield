 (a)           Exchange Fund. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent in connection with the Mergers (the “Exchange Agent”). Prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause Holdco or Purchaser to deposit, with the Exchange Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in the Mergers (collectively, the “Cash Amounts”, and all such cash deposited with the Exchange Agent, the “Exchange Fund”), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Minority Limited Partners and Parent (solely to the extent any amounts in the Exchange Fund are in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to ​Section 2.1(a)(i)). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Cash Amounts, Parent shall, or shall cause Holdco or Purchaser to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Cash Amounts, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this ​Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent on the earlier of (i) one (1) year after the Closing or (ii) the full payment of the Exchange Fund; provided, that any amounts in the Exchange Fund in excess of the amounts payable under ​Section 2.1(a)(i) shall be promptly paid to Parent.

  (b)           Procedures for Surrender. Promptly after the Closing (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the Closing), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of (i) a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares or Company Partnership Units of the Minority Limited Partners (the “Certificates”) or (ii) non-certificated Company Shares or Company Partnership Units of the Minority Limited Partners represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) and, in each case, whose Company Shares or Company Partnership Units were converted pursuant to ​Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock or Company Partnership Unit formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to the provisions of this ​Article II (rounded down to the nearest whole share, if applicable), to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5) Business Days following the later to occur of (i) the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time or (ii) the Exchange Agent’s receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this ​Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.   (c)           Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Company Merger Effective Time and Partnership Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company and the Company Operating Partnership shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares or Company Partnership Units on the records of the Company and the Company Operating Partnership. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time and Partnership Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and Minority Limited Partner holders of Company Partnership Units shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares or Company Partnership Units except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Company Merger Effective Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent Parties, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership, or the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (e)           Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent, and if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by the holder thereof of a bond in the amount and the form reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to such Certificates, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to ​Section 2.1.

  (b)           Notwithstanding anything in this ​Section 5.2 to the contrary, but subject to the Company’s compliance with the provisions of this ​Section 5.2, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if the Company receives an unsolicited written bona fide Company Alternative Proposal, the Company and its Representatives may contact the third party making such Company Alternative Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Company Alternative Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal. If (i) such Company Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such Company Alternative Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Company Alternative Proposal (including its respective Representatives and prospective equity and debt financing sources), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company having provisions that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit

The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of any Company Alternative Proposal or inquiry, offer, request or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Alternative Proposal (an “Inquiry”), in each case, received by the Company, which notice shall identify the material terms and conditions thereof and the Person making such Company Alternative Proposal or Inquiry (including, if applicable, providing copies of any written Company Alternative Proposals or Inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto). It is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or negotiations permitted under this Section 5.2(b), including any public announcement that the Company or the Company Board has made any determination contemplated under this Section 5.2(b) to take or engage in any such actions, shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, but subject to the Company’s compliance with the provisions of this ​Section 5.2, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board of Directors may, in response to a Company Superior Proposal received by the Company after the date of this Agreement, (x) make a Company Change of Recommendation and/or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e); provided, that the Company Board of Directors shall not be entitled to make such a Company Change of Recommendation or cause any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (A) unless the Company shall have given Parent at least four Business Days’ written notice (a “Company Superior Proposal Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, which Company Superior Proposal Notice shall include a description of the terms and conditions of the Company Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the Company Board of Directors, the identity of the Person making the Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any proposed definitive agreement for such Company Superior Proposal or other material correspondence, if any, and (B) unless, at the end of the four-Business Day period following the delivery of such Company Superior Proposal Notice (the “Company Superior Proposal Notice Period”), after taking into account any firm commitments made by Parent in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the Company Superior Proposal giving rise to the Company Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with the standard of conduct required of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law; provided, that any material modifications to the terms of the Company Superior Proposal shall commence a new Company Superior Proposal Notice Period of two Business Days. During the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case of a Company Superior Proposal, such Company Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal.

During the Company Intervening Event Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement.   (e)            Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law or rules and policies of the NYSE, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the standard of conduct required of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law.   (f)             “Company Alternative Proposal” means any proposal or offer made by any Person or group of Persons (other than the Parent Parties or their respective Affiliates) relating to or concerning (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company, in each case, as a result of which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction would cease to own at least 75% of the total voting power of the Company or the surviving entity (or any direct or indirect parent company

  (g)            “Company Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Company Alternative Proposal, substituting in the definition thereof “50%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase appears, that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and considering such factors as the Company Board of Directors considers to be appropriate, to be more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from a financial point of view and is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms and timing proposed, after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, the identity of the Person making the Company Alternative Proposal, the financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Company Alternative Proposal, including the expected timing and likelihood of consummation, conditions to consummation and availability of necessary financing.   (h)            “Company Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence or development that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and that is unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement; provided, that the receipt, existence or terms of a Company Alternative Proposal or any change in the price or trading volume of any securities of the Company or Parent shall not be deemed to be a Company Intervening Event hereunder (however, the underlying reasons for such changes may constitute a Company Intervening Event).

(a)            Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, solely for purposes of furthering the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby or integration planning relating thereto, during normal business hours, on reasonable advance notice, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Company Merger Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to ​Section 8.1, to the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ properties, contracts, commitments, books and records, other than any such matters that relate to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, including with respect to the consideration or valuation of the Mergers or any financial or strategic alternatives thereto, or any Company Alternative Proposal; provided, that the Company may provide such access by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under applicable Law (including any COVID-19 Measures). The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to afford such access or furnish such information if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade secret protection to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would result in the disclosure of any information in connection with any litigation or similar dispute between the parties hereto or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law (provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in any the foregoing events). No investigation hereunder shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies available hereunder.

For a period of six years after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Company Merger Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; provided, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding (as defined below) pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding or resolution of such claim, even if beyond such six-year period. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this ​Section 6.4.   (b)        Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing or any related expenses) each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators, and successors and assigns, an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time.

 (c)        For a period of six years from the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Company Merger Effective Time; provided, that after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. At the Company’s option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, a six-year prepaid “tail” policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Company Merger Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that the Company shall not commit or spend on such “tail” policy, in the aggregate, more than 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement for the Company’s current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, and if the cost of such “tail” policy would otherwise exceed such limit, the Company shall be permitted to purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for up to such limit. If such prepaid “tail” policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.   (d)        Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this ​Section 6.4.   (e)        The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Partnership, any other indemnification arrangement, the MGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this ​Section 6.4 shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  (f)         In the event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Partnership or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Partnership, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this ​Section 6.4.   Section 6.5          Employee Matters.   (a)        For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Continuation Period”), Parent will provide (or cause an affiliate of Parent to provide) to each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Closing (each, a “Continuing Employee”), while such Continuing Employee continues in employment with Parent or one of its affiliates (including the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries) following the Closing, with: (i) a base salary or an hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is no lower than the base salary or hourly wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii)  employee benefits (excluding retention or change in control bonuses or similar payments, equity and equity based compensation, long-term cash incentives and retiree welfare benefits) that are either (x) substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing or (y) the same as those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent Guarantor as of immediately prior to the Closing (or, if more favorable to employees, those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent Guarantor from time to time during the Continuation Period).   (b)        For fiscal year 2022, Parent will provide each Continuing Employee (i) with a target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity that is no less favorable than the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) a target long-term incentive opportunity that is no less favorable than target annual long-term incentive opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.   (c)        For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and participation under Parent Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees participate after the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under Company Benefit Plans, except (x) to the extent providing such credit would result in any duplication of benefits, (y) for benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or postretirement welfare plan or (z) with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. In addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of any Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements applied to the Continuing Employee under comparable Company Benefit Plans); and (ii) any co-payments, deductibles and other eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and/or his or her covered dependents during the plan year ending on the Closing Date to be credited for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year of each comparable Parent Benefit Plan that occurs during the year in which the Closing Date occurs (to the extent such credit would have been given under comparable Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing).

The Parties agree to the terms set forth in Section 6.5(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (e)        On the earlier of (i) a date that is on, or within five (5) Business Days prior to, the Closing Date and (ii) the ordinary course payment date, the Company may pay to each employee who, immediately prior to the payment date, is employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary and is eligible to participate in an annual bonus program of the Company or any Company Subsidiary such employee’s annual bonus with respect to the

The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the prior review and comment of Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent. To the extent a Company Qualified DC Plan is terminated pursuant to this Section 6.5(f), (i) as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letters from the IRS on the termination of such Company Qualified DC Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants and Parent shall permit such participants who are then actively employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) and outstanding loans, in the form of cash or notes in respect of outstanding loans, from the Company Qualified DC Plan to the applicable Parent Benefit Plan that is a Tax-qualified defined contribution plan with a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (a “Parent Qualified DC Plan”) and (ii) Parent shall cause each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate in a Parent Qualified DC Plan effective as of the Closing Date.

Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other reasonably informed of, and cooperate with such party in connection with, any stockholder litigation or claim against such party and/or its directors or officers relating to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such litigation or claim and the Company shall not compromise or settle, or agree to compromise or settle, any stockholder litigation or claim arising or resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

      (c)            Parent may, or may request the Company to, in which case the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, commence, promptly following receipt of such request, one or more offers to prepay all or a portion of the Private Placement Notes and/or one or more consent solicitations regarding certain proposed amendments to the Note Purchase Agreements (any such consent solicitation, a “Consent Solicitation”) as reasonably requested by Parent (any such prepayment offer, including any Consent Solicitation, a “Prepayment Offer”), including to eliminate, waive or amend the change of control provisions and to amend the covenants or redemption provisions in such Note Purchase Agreements. Any Prepayment Offer shall be made on such terms and conditions as determined by Parent in accordance with the terms of the applicable Private Placement Notes and Note Purchase Agreement and subject to the reasonable approval of the Company (other than with respect to the Reserved Terms of any such Prepayment Offer which shall be determined by Parent in its sole discretion, provided that such determinations are permitted by the terms of the applicable Private Placement Notes, Note Purchase Agreements and applicable Law) and subject to the provisos to the following sentence. The Company shall waive any of the conditions relating to any Prepayment Offer to be made by the Company (other than the terms and conditions set forth in the provisos to this sentence), as applicable, as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing and shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to any such Prepayment Offer or make any changes to any such Prepayment Offer other than as consented to or approved by Parent; provided, that, in any event, the terms and conditions of any such Prepayment Offer shall provide that the closing thereof shall be contingent upon the Closing and the proposed amendments that are the subject of any Consent Solicitation shall only become operative upon acceptance of the applicable Private Placement Notes for purchase pursuant to any related Prepayment Offer substantially concurrently with the Closing.   (d)            The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, use its and their respective reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent in connection with the commencement and conduction of any Prepayment Offer, including reasonable assistance with the preparation of any deliverables required under the applicable Note Purchase Agreement; provided, that neither the Company nor any counsel for the Company shall be required to furnish (i) any legal opinions or (ii) any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for use in connection with any Prepayment Offer (and no such information shall be used without the Company’s prior written consent). Any documents (including all amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the Private Placement Notes in connection with any Prepayment Offer shall be prepared by Parent subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and shall be reasonably acceptable in form and substance to each of them; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the terms and conditions of any Prepayment Offer shall be subject to ​Section 6.15(c) above. The Company shall have the right to review in advance, and Parent shall consult with the Company on and consider in good faith the views of the Company in connection with, all of the information relating to the Company, as the case may be, and any of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective Representatives, that appears in any documentation in connection with any Prepayment Offer. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to, in connection with any Prepayment Offer, (x) incur any liability or pay any amounts unless such liability or payment is either conditioned on the Closing or such amount is reimbursed or indemnified hereunder or (y) otherwise amend the terms of the Private Placement Notes or Note Purchase Agreements in a manner adverse to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless such amendment is conditioned on the Closing and the terms of such amendment are consistent with the terms of the Debt Financing or Parent’s other outstanding indebtedness. If at any time prior to the completion of a Prepayment Offer any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives, should be discovered by a Party that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the documents in connection with a Prepayment Offer, so that either such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, following which an appropriate amendment or supplement shall be prepared and disseminated to the holders of the applicable Private Placement Notes after consulting with the other Parties and considering in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with, all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective Representatives, that appears in such amendment or supplement.

  Section 8.2     Effect of Termination.   (a)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in ​Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party, except that: (i) no such termination shall relieve the Company of its obligation to pay the Company Termination Payment, if, as and when required pursuant to ​Section 8.2(b); (ii) no such termination shall relieve any Party for liability for such Party’s willful and material breach of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement prior to its termination; and (iii) the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of ​Section 6.1(b), the last sentence of ​Section 6.14(c), this ​Section 8.2 and ​Article IX shall survive the termination hereof.   (b)            In the event that:   (i)            (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Alternative Proposal (substituting in the definition thereof “50%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase appears) shall have been received by the Company or its Representatives or is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed (a “Qualifying Transaction”), (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to ​Section 8.1(c) or ​Section 8.1(g) or by Parent pursuant to ​Section 8.1(b)(i) and (C) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company shall have (1) consummated such Qualifying Transaction or another Company Alternative Proposal (substituting in the definition thereof “50%” for “25%” and for “75%” in each place each such phrase appears) or (2) entered into a definitive agreement providing for and later consummated such Qualifying Transaction or Company Alternative Proposal;   (ii)            this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to ​Section 8.1(e); or   (iii)            this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to ​Section 8.1(d);   then, in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this ​Section 8.2(b), the Company shall pay Parent or its designee the Company Termination Payment in accordance with the escrow procedures set forth in ​Section 8.2(d), (x) in the case of ​Section 8.2(b)(iii), within three (3) Business Days after such termination, (y) concurrently with such termination if pursuant to ​Section 8.2(b)(ii) or (z) in the case of only ​Section 8.2(b)(i), three (3) Business Days after the consummation of such Qualifying Transaction or Company Alternative Proposal; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Payment on more than one occasion. As used herein, “Company Termination Payment” shall mean a cash amount equal to $300,000,000.   (c)            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent provides a notice of termination and such termination would result in the obligation to pay the Company Termination Payment, the payment of such Company Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise; provided, that the foregoing shall not impair the rights of Parent, if any, to obtain injunctive relief and/or specific performance pursuant to ​Section 9.14 prior to any termination of this Agreement.

  (d)            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:   (i)            If the Company is obligated to pay Parent or its designee a Company Termination Payment, such Company Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of same day funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with this Section 8.2(d). In the event that the Company is obligated to pay Parent or its designee a Company Termination Payment, the amount payable to Parent or its designee in any taxable year of Parent Guarantor shall not exceed the lesser of (I) such Company Termination Payment payable to Parent or its designee, and (II) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent or its designee without causing Parent Guarantor to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant taxable year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (“Qualifying Income”) and taking into account any known or anticipated income of the Parent Guarantor which is not Qualifying Income and any appropriate “cushion”, in each case, as determined by Parent Guarantor’s independent accountants, plus (B) in the event Parent Guarantor

receives either (x) a letter from Parent Guarantor’s counsel indicating that Parent Guarantor has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this ​Section 8.2(d) or (y) an opinion from Parent Guarantor’s outside counsel as described below in this ​Section 8.2(d), an amount equal to the excess of such Company Termination Payment, less the amount payable under subclause (A) above. The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of any Company Termination Payment shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years from the date the Company Termination Payment first becomes payable under ​Section 8.2(b). Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to pay the Company Termination Payment terminates shall be released to the Company.   (ii)            To secure the Company’s obligation to pay these amounts, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to such Company Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Company on such terms (subject to this ​Section 8.2(d)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of such Company Termination Payment pursuant to this ​Section 8.2(d) shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay Parent or its designee such amount pursuant to this ​Section 8.2 by wire transfer of same day funds. The escrow agreement shall provide that such Company Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent or its designee unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (A) a letter from Parent Guarantor’s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent or its designee without causing Parent Guarantor to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and taking into account any known or anticipated income of Parent Guarantor which is not Qualifying Income and any appropriate “cushion”, in each case, as determined by Parent Guarantor’s independent accountants, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent or its designee, or (B) a letter from Parent Guarantor’s counsel indicating that (x) Parent Guarantor received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent Guarantor of such Company Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (y) Parent Guarantor’s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent or its designee of such Company Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of such Company Termination Payment to Parent or its designee. The Company agrees to amend this ​Section 8.2(d) at the reasonable request of Parent in order to (i) maximize the portion of such Company Termination Payment that may be distributed to Parent or its designee hereunder without causing Parent Guarantor to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii) assist Parent Guarantor in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in each case, as described in this ​Section 8.2(d). Any amount of any Company Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this ​Section 8.2(d).

  (e)            Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this ​Section 8.2 are an integral part of the Transactions and that the Company Termination Payment is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(c)        Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this ​Section 9.14, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) no Parent Related Party that is not a party hereto shall have any Liability (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other Person for any obligations or Liabilities to any party hereto under this Agreement and (ii) no Company Related Party that is not a party hereto shall have any Liability (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Parent Parties or any other Person for any obligations or Liabilities to any party hereto under this Agreement.

Section 9.16         Guaranty. Parent Guarantor irrevocably guarantees each of the obligations of the Parent Parties under this Agreement (the “Guaranteed Obligations”). If any Parent Party fails to perform any Guaranteed Obligation, Parent Guarantor, upon written request of the Company, shall, or shall cause such Parent Party to, perform such obligations promptly upon receipt of such request. This guaranty shall apply regardless of any amendments, variations, alterations, waivers or extensions to this Agreement, except to the extent any of the foregoing modifies the application thereof. Parent Guarantor hereby waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Company upon this Section 9.16 or acceptance of this Section 9.16. The Guaranteed Obligations conclusively shall be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Section 9.16, and all dealings between the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, likewise conclusively shall be presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Section 9.16.

  ANNEX I   CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER   Capitalized terms used in this Annex I but not otherwise defined have the meanings given to such terms in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) of which this Annex I is a part.   Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser will not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchaser’s obligation to pay for or return tendered Company Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the payment for, any tendered Company Shares, and (subject to the provisions of the Agreement) may terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any tendered Company Shares, at any scheduled Expiration Date (as it may have been extended pursuant to ​Section 1.1 of the Agreement) if (i) the condition in clause (1) below has not been satisfied by one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the Expiration Date (the “Expiration Time”) or (ii) any of the additional conditions set forth below are not satisfied or waived in writing by Parent at the Expiration Time:   1. The number of Company Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, together with any Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (if any), represents at least a majority of all then-outstanding Company Shares as of the Expiration Time (the “Minimum Condition”);   2. No injunction or similar Order by any court of competent jurisdiction, nor any Law by any Governmental Entity, in each case, whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent, that prohibits, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the Offer or the other Transactions, shall have been entered, enacted, issued, promulgated, or enforced and continue to be in effect;   3. (i) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the first sentence and second sentence of ​Section 3.2(a) and the first sentence and second sentence of ​Section 3.2(b) shall be true and correct in all respects, except for any de minimis inaccuracies, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date); (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in first and second sentence of ​Section 3.1(a), ​Section 3.1(b), the third sentence of ​Section 3.2(a), the third sentence of ​Section 3.2(b), ​Section 3.2(d), ​Section 3.2(e), ​Section 3.3, ​Section 3.4, ​Section 3.21, ​Section 3.24 and ​Section 3.28 shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date); (iii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in ​Section 3.8(a) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, as if made at and as of such time; (iv) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in ​Article III that are qualified by a “Company Material Adverse Effect” qualification shall be true and correct in all respects as so qualified as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date); and (v) the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in ​Article III shall be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except with respect to this clause (v) where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to materiality or “Company Material Adverse Effect”) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;   


  


  


  4. Each of the Company and the Company Operating Partnership shall have performed or complied in all material respects with all obligations required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Expiration Time;   5.

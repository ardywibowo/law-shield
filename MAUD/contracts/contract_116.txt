(5)    For purposes of clarity, the number of shares of Company Stock underlying the Vested Company PSUs, for which the performance period has not been achieved as of the Effective Time, will be determined based on actual performance, based on the results through the Effective Time as determined in good faith by the Company’s Compensation Committee (in consultation with Parent), taking into account truncation of goals based on the remaining time in the performance period and seasonality of performance, and the number of shares underlying the Vested Company PSUs, for which the performance period has been achieved, will be based on such achievement; provided that with respect to Vested Company PSUs that were granted in 2021 for which the performance period has not yet been achieved, such achievement will be deemed at 100% of target.   ( v )     Payment Procedures. The Surviving Corporation shall pay on the timing dates set forth above all Cash Replacement Amounts, as applicable, net of any applicable withholding Taxes, through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation’s payroll (subject to any required tax withholdings) to the applicable holders of such Company Equity Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company SARs, Company RSUs and Company PSUs pursuant to this Section 3.2(a), cannot be made through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder promptly following the Effective Time.   19

   (b)    With respect to any amount payable under Section 3.2(a) that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that payment of such amount would otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under this Agreement and the terms of the corresponding award that will not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock, other capital stock of the Company, or other compensation of any kind (other than amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2(a) to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any Company equity or equity-based awards under the Company Stock Plans otherwise and the Company Stock Plans will thereupon terminate.   Section 3.3    Payment for Securities.   ( a )    Paying Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with an entity designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c). On the Closing Date and substantially concurrently with the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(a)(iii) and the Rollover Shares, and assuming there are no Dissenting Shares), an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable at or in connection with the Closing (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 3.3(a), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund.   (b)    Payment Procedures.   (i)    Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any event not more than three (3) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares, the Rollover Shares, and shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(a)(iii)) (the “Certificates”); and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares, the Rollover Shares, and shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(a)(iii)) (the “Uncertificated Shares”), (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form and reasonably acceptable to the Company (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii) and any dividends or other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay, in exchange therefor, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay, in exchange therefor, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares, and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Paying Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii) and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares as contemplated by clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii).   20

   (ii)    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company with the objective that the Paying Agent will transmit to the Depository Trust Company or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(a)(iii), the Rollover Shares and Dissenting Shares, and including any dividends or other distributions pertaining to such shares as contemplated by clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c)) held of record by the Depository Trust Company or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time.   ( c )    Termination Rights . All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock, subject, however, to (i) Section 3.4 and (ii) the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared by the Company on Company Common Stock prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation to be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(b)), and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to such shares as contemplated by clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c), without any interest thereon.   21

   (d)    Termination of Exchange Fund . Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to their former shares of Company Common Stock that such former holders have the right to receive pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section 3.3(c), without interest thereon, shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (as general unsecured creditors) for payment of their claim, in respect of such shares.   ( e )    No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (f )    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(a)(iii)) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.   Section 3.4    Dissenter’s Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised and validly perfected appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, in accordance with, but only if and when required by, the provisions of such Section 262, unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than such rights as are provided to holders of Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments relating to appraisal demands received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands and the Company shall consider in good faith comments or suggestions proposed by Parent with respect to such demands; provided that, after the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to comply with Section 262 of the DGCL.   22

To the extent that amounts are so properly deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

Section 5.5    Financing.   (a)    Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of an executed commitment letter dated as of the date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and, so long as in accordance with Section 6.16, amendments thereto, the “Equity Commitment Letter”) from the Equity Financing Source, pursuant to which the Equity Financing Source has committed to provide, subject only to the terms and conditions set forth therein, equity financing for the Transactions in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the “Financing”). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is a third-party beneficiary thereof. The Equity Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered to the Company, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and the Equity Financing Source, fully and specifically enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies, whether considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity).

As of the date of this Agreement, the Equity Financing Source has not notified Parent of its intention to terminate any commitment set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter or not to provide the Financing. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter as disclosed to the Company prior to the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement and assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing to be satisfied by it, or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the Transactions, is not and will not be subject to the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any financing or the consummation of any other transaction.   43

Section 5.6    Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the Company’s stockholders (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

   (e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval if, in response to a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn that did not result from a breach in any material respect of this Section 6.4, the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel) that (i) such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to make the Company Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, (A) subject to compliance with Section 6.4(f), the Company Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, may make a Company Change in Recommendation or (B) the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant t o Section 8.1(h) in order to enter into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) unless the Company (x) has complied with its obligations under Section 6.4(f), (y) pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.4(c) prior to or concurrently with to such termination and (z) concurrently with such termination, enters into a definitive Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement that documents the terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal.   (f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to make a Company Change in Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.4(e) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice (the “Company Superior Proposal Notice”), which notice shall not constitute a Company Change in Recommendation, advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and the material terms and conditions of any such Company Superior Proposal), the identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and copies of all definitive or proposed agreements or other material documents submitted in connection therewith and (y):   ( i )     during the four (4) Business Day period, if requested in writing by Parent in good faith, the Company and its Representatives shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement intended by Parent to cause such Company Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal; and   (ii)    the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement that may be proposed in writing by Parent (the “Parent Proposed Changed Terms”) no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel) that the Company Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if such Parent Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect, and that the failure to make the Company Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under applicable Law.   For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) material revisions to the terms of a Company Superior Proposal or (2) material revisions to a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new Company Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Company Superior Proposal Notice, except that the references to four (4) Business Days in this Section 6.4(f) shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days.   53

Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.   Section 6.7     Access to Information; Confidentiality.   (a)    From the date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable prior notice, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to afford to Parent and Parent’s Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all of the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ officers, senior executives, properties, Contracts, books and records.

   (b)    No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.   (c)    The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder; provided, however, that, notwithstanding Section 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company may provide Evaluation Materials (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) furnished by the Company to Parent pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement to the financing sources in connection with the financing of the Transactions, subject solely to receiving customary confidentiality undertakings by such financing sources, and that each such financing source shall be considered a “Representative” of Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement.   Section 6.8    Public Statements. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company will not, and each of the foregoing will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior written consent of the Other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a Party or its Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party’s or its parent entity’s capital stock is traded; provided that such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the Other Party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comments regarding same, (b) a Party or its Representatives may issue any public announcement or make other public disclosure that is consistent with prior public announcements issued or public disclosures made in compliance with the second sentence of this Section 6.8 without the prior written consent of the Other Party, (c) Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates may issue disclosures or communications to existing or prospective general or limited partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of such Person or any Affiliates of such Person, provided, in each case such disclosures or communications are made in the ordinary course of business and subject to customary confidentiality restrictions, and (d) the second sentence of this Section 6.8 shall not apply with respect to a public announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of a Company Acquisition Proposal and the publication of any press release or announcement with respect to a Company Change in Recommendation made in accordance with Section 6.4.   Section 6.9     Takeover Laws . None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub will take any action that would cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions from the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the Transactions.   57

   Section 6.10    Third-Party Approvals. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities and third parties necessary to consummate the Transactions and to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits (including Environmental Permits), consents, approvals and authorizations and to cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as practicable; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required under this Section 6.10 to compensate any third party, make any accommodation commitment or incur any liability or obligation to any third-party to obtain any such consent or approval, unless Parent or its Affiliates agree to compensate any such third-party on the Company’s behalf or to promptly reimburse the Company for any payments made or liabilities to any such third party, in each case in connection with obtaining such consents or approvals, and the Company shall not compensate or agree to compensate any such third- party, make any accommodation commitment or incur any liability or obligation to any such third party in connection with obtaining such consents or approvals without the prior written consent of Parent. Each of Parent and the Company has the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Entities in connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each Party hereto agrees that it will consult with the Other Party with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions, and each Party will keep the Other Party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the Transactions. This Section 6.10 shall not apply to (i) approval under Antitrust Laws or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Proxy Statement.   Section 6.11    Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.   (a)    Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the Company’s Organizational Documents, or, if applicable, the Company Subsidiaries’ Organizational Documents, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and also with respect to any such Person, by reason of the fact such Person is or was a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other Benefit Plan or enterprise (regardless of whether such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the Company) serving at the request of or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties” ) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by, and subject to the conditions and procedures set forth in, applicable Law in connection with any Proceeding and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, Judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security ; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the payment of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay all amounts so paid in advance if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. The indemnification and advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 6.11 extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Proceeding relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Proceeding relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement and inure to the benefit of such person’s heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.11(a), upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation in writing (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.11(a), except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party’s position with respect to such claims). As used in this Section 6.11: the term “Indemnification Expenses” means reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and expenses and all other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including experts’ fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Proceeding for which indemnification is required to be provided pursuant to this Section 6.11(a), including any Proceeding relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any Judgment in any actual or threatened Proceeding in respect of which indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or Judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.   58

   (b)    Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company’s Organizational Documents or the Company Subsidiaries’ Organizational Documents will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.   (c)    Except to the extent required by applicable Law, and then only to the minimum extent required by Law, the Surviving Corporation’s Organizational Documents and each Company Subsidiary’s Organizational Documents will contain provisions no less favorable in any material respect with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Company’s Organizational Documents and such Company Subsidiary’s Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law, and then only to the minimum extent required by Law; provided, however, that any such modification shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to modification; provided, further, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding made within such period continue until the disposition of such Proceeding.   59

   (d)    The Company shall, on or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a 6-year tail policy with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Parties in coverage and amount no greater than the policies currently in place so long as the total premiums paid would not exceed 300% of the last annual premiums paid for the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies; provided that if the aggregate cost would exceed that limit, the Company shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable up to such limit.   (e)    If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.   (f)      Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11.   (g)    This Section 6.11 survives the consummation of the Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and personal representatives, and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.   Section 6.12    Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.  Prior to taking the actions required by this Section 6.12, the Company will provide Parent copies of any resolutions or other documentation with respect to such actions and the Company shall give consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent.   Section 6.13     Employee Matters.   (a)    For a period of one year after the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who is an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any such employees who are on disability or other approved leave), other than an employee whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement (the “Continuing Employee”), for so long as the Continuing Employee is employed by the Surviving Corporation during the Continuation Period, (i) base cash compensation that is no less favorable than as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)  short-term bonus and short-term incentive opportunities (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than those under the Company Benefits Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, but not limited to, the Company’s Change in Control Severance Policy, and any other severance policies) or Benefit Plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements of Parent or the Surviving Corporation as in effect at the time of termination of employment, whichever is greater and (iv) employee Benefit Plans and arrangements (other than defined benefit pension, retiree welfare, base cash compensation, short-term and long-term bonus and short-term and long-term incentive opportunities, nonqualified deferred compensation, change in control, equity and equity-based compensation and severance benefits) to Continuing Employees that are no less favorable in the aggregate to either those provided to the Continuing Employees as of the date hereof or those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or any of its Affiliates.   60








________________


   (b)    Parent shall take commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to permit each Continuing Employee to either continue to participate from and after the Closing Date for the Continuation Period in the Company Benefit Plans (excluding any equity or equity-based arrangements or any long-term incentive arrangements) in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, or be eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date in Benefit Plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates. To the extent Parent causes a Continuing Employee to cease to be eligible to participate in a Company Benefit Plan and instead provides for such Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate in a Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates (the “Replacement Plans”), if such Replacement Plan is a group health plan, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit (or cause to be credited) such Continuing Employee, for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, with any deductibles and copayments already incurred during such plan year under the comparable Company Benefit Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize each Continuing Employee’s years of service and level of seniority with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including service and seniority with any other employer that was recognized by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) for purposes of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting and vacation benefit determination (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under the Replacement Plans, to the same extent and for the same purpose as was credited to the Continuing Employee under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing, but no credit for any service will be required that would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the waiver of any preexisting condition exclusion or restriction with respect to participation and coverage requirements under a Replacement Plan that is a group health plan applicable to a Continuing Employee for the plan year in which the Closing occurs to the extent such exclusion or restriction did not apply with respect to such Continuing Employee under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms (it being understood that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Surviving Corporation, Parent or its Affiliates from amending, modifying, replacing or terminating such arrangements in accordance with their terms).   (c)    Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned but not yet taken by each Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date.   (d)    Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an establishment of, termination of, modification of, amendment to, or be construed as establishing, terminating, modifying, or amending, any benefit or compensation plan, program, Contract, arrangement or agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, nor prohibit or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to establish, amend, modify or termination any benefit or compensation plan, program, Contract, arrangement or agreement at any time. The provisions of this Section 6.13 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary), other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.   61

   Section 6.14    Transaction Litigation. In the event that any litigation or other Proceeding by any stockholder related to this Agreement or the Transactions is initiated or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the members of the Company Board (or of any equivalent governing body of any Company Subsidiary) prior to the Effective Time, the Special Committee, on behalf of the Company, shall control the defense of any such litigation or other Proceeding; provided, however, that the Company shall promptly notify Parent, and any Indemnified Party that is named as a party in such Proceeding, of any such litigation or other Proceeding and shall keep Parent, and any such Indemnified Party, reasonably informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto). The Company shall consult with Parent on a regular basis with respect to, and shall give Parent, and Indemnified Party that is named as a party in such Proceeding, the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of, any security holder litigation or other Proceeding against the Company or its respective directors relating to the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company will not, without the prior written consent of an Indemnified Party settle any claims against such Indemnified Party unless the settlement solely involves the payment of money by persons other than such Indemnified Party and includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from liability on matters that are the subject of such Proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.14, nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information if the Company reasonably determines that such disclosure would (A) constitute a violation of any Contract with respect to confidentiality or non-disclosure owing to a third party (including any Governmental Entity) to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, (B) constitute a violation of any applicable Law or (C) result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege; provided that information may be disclosed subject to a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, and any such Indemnified Party, to the extent that the Company determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws; provided, further, that the Company shall not be permitted to assume the defense of any Indemnified Party to the extent the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded (based on the advice of counsel) that there is reasonably likely to be a material conflict of interest between the Company (or any other person or persons included in a joint defense) and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of such action. For the avoidance of doubt, any Proceeding related to Dissenting Shares will be governed by Section 3.4. The provisions of this Section 6.14 that concern the conduct of Proceedings against any Indemnified Parties shall survive the consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and personal representatives, and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.   Section 6.15    Stock Exchange De-listing. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company Common Stock to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act at or as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time.   Section 6.16    Financing.   (a)    No Amendments to Equity Commitment Letter. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will not (without the prior written consent of the Company) permit any amendment or modification (including an amendment or modification effected by way of side letter) to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter.   62

   (b )    Equity Financing. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing, including (i) maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) complying with its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfying (or obtaining a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to (and within control of) Parent or Merger Sub in such Equity Commitment Letter, (iv) enforcing its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, (v) consummating the Financing at or prior to Closing, including by causing the Equity Financing Source to fund the Financing at the Closing. Upon the consummation of the Financing to Parent, in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter, Parent shall draw down at Closing such amount of such Financing as is required to make the full amount of payments it is required to make pursuant to Article III.   (c)    Financing Cooperation.   (i)    Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to provide (in each case at Parent’s sole expense) the following cooperation to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of any debt financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.16(c) shall require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client, attorney work product or similar privilege or to contravene Law or violate any Contract; provided, that the Company or such Subsidiary shall use reasonable best efforts to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information, and in the case of any Contract, Company shall, to the extent permitted by such confidentiality obligations, notify Parent if any such information that Parent, Merger Sub or any Financing Source has specifically identified and requested is being withheld as a result of any such obligation of confidentiality), (i) assisting in preparation for and participate (and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause management of an appropriate level to participate) in a reasonable number of meetings (but no more than two (2) in person “bank meetings” and additional telephonic meetings at reasonably agreed times), due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, and presentations with prospective lenders and rating agencies, (ii) assisting Parent with the timely preparation of customary materials for bank information memoranda and ratings agency presentations (and assisting in the obtaining of corporate, credit and facility ratings from ratings agencies), (including executing and delivering a customary authorization letter to the extent reasonably requested by the lenders authorizing the distribution of information about the Company and its Subsidiaries to prospective lenders), (iii) furnishing Parent with the historical financial statements of the Company reasonably requested by the applicable financing sources or arrangers, including (A) within forty-five (45) days after the end of any fiscal quarter that is not a fiscal year end, with the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such quarter and the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, (B) within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of any fiscal year, with the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year and the related audited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, and (C) such information as is necessary in connection with Parent’s preparation of pro forma financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries of the type necessary or reasonably requested by the Financing Sources to be included in any bank information memoranda or other customary marketing materials, including by providing such financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses (it being understood that the Company needs only provide information to assist in the preparation thereof, and shall not be required to provide pro forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments), (iv) providing Parent and Merger Sub with information reasonably necessary to complete customary perfection certificates and other customary loan documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the Merger Sub, (v) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral as of (but not prior to) the Closing and (vi) provide all documentation and other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably required under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to the extent requested in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.   63

   (ii)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.16(c), no action contemplated in this Section 6.16(c) shall be required if any such action shall: (I) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or ongoing operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries; (II) (x) cause any representation or warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement to be breached or (y) cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to violate or waive any attorney-client privilege or beach any Contract, applicable Law or Organizational Document; (III) involve the entry into any definitive agreements with respect to any debt financing or any other binding commitment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is not contingent upon the Closing Date occurring or that would be effective prior to the Closing Date (excluding the authorization and representation letters mentioned above); (IV) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives to provide (or to have provided on its behalf) any certificates that would be effective prior to the Closing Date or any legal opinions; (V) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any out-of-pocket fees or expenses prior to the Closing that are not promptly reimbursed by Parent as set forth in Section 6.16(c)(iii) if the Closing does not occur; (VI) cause any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability; (VII) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver any pledge or security documents or certificates, documents or instruments relating to the provision of guarantees and collateral in connection with the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing Date occurring or that would be effective prior to the Closing Date; (VIII) except as necessary to give effect to the items expressly contemplated in this Section 6.16(c) and without limiting clauses (III) and (VII) above, require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver any documentation (including corporate resolutions) related to the Financing; or (IX) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in Article VII to fail to be satisfied. The Company hereby consents to the use of the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ logos solely to the extent necessary in connection with the Financing and solely in connection with a description of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the reputation or goodwill of the relevant party, or any of their respective Intellectual Property rights and will comply with the Company’s usage requirements and guidelines to the extent made available to Parent prior to such use. In no event shall the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates be in breach of this Agreement because of the failure to deliver any financial or other information that is not readily available or is not otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries at the time requested by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any breach by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries of their obligations under this Section 6.16(c), shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement for the purposes of Article VIII or a breach of the condition precedent set forth in Section 7.3, unless the Company has knowingly and willfully breached its obligations under this Section 6.16(c) and such breach has been the primary and direct cause of Parent’s debt financing not being obtained.   (iii)    Parent shall (A) promptly reimburse the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation provided for in this Section 6.16, and (B) promptly indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) actually suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement or consummation of the Financing, except to the extent any such liabilities, claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties arise out of or result from bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by any of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, as determined by a final, non- appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.   64

If any cash balances distributed or transferred pursuant to this Section 6.17 are paid to direct or indirect equity holders of the Company, such payments shall be treated as Merger Consideration subject to Section 1001 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign Laws).

Section 8.3    Effect of Termination . In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated as provided in Section 8.1, each of the Parties will be relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination will be without liability to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Affiliates; provided that the agreements and obligations of the Parties set forth in Section 4.24, Section 5.13, Section 6.7(c), Section 6.16(c)(iii), the last sentence of Section 6.17, this Section 8.3, Section 8.4 and Article IX (to the extent applicable) hereof will survive any such termination and are enforceable hereunder; Parent and the Company may have liability as provided in Section 8.4; and nothing in this Section 8.3 will relieve any of Parent or the Company of any liability for breach of the Confidentiality Agreement or as provided in the Guarantee, in which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent have any liability under this Agreement for any breach by the Company Stockholder of the Contribution Agreement, the Support Agreement or any other act or failure to act by the Company Stockholder. In addition, nothing in this Section 8.3 will relieve (x) subject to the limitations contained in Section 8.4(j), Parent, or subject to the limitations in Section 8.4(i), the Company, of any liability for fraud or (y) subject to the limitation contained in Section 8.4(i), the Company of any liability for Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation in a circumstance in which Parent is not entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee.   Section 8.4    Fees and Expense Reimbursement.   (a)    In the event that (A) prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Company Acquisition Proposal is publicly submitted, publicly proposed, publicly disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Company Board prior to, and not withdrawn at the date of termination of this Agreement, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (Outside Date) or Section 8.1(f) (Failure to Obtain Company Stockholder Approval) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (Company Breach) and (C) within twelve (12) months after the date this Agreement is terminated, the Company consummates a Company Acquisition Proposal or enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of a Company Acquisition Proposal, then the Company will pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent the Company Termination Fee upon the consummation of such Company Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Section 8.4(a), any reference in the definition of Company Acquisition Transaction to “twenty percent (20%)” shall be deemed to be to be a reference to “fifty percent (50%).”   (b)    In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(g) (Company Change in Recommendation), the Company will pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent the Company Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of termination of this Agreement.

   (d)    Any payment of the Company Termination Fee will be made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.   (e)    In the event this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(i), or (ii) Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) at such time the Company could have validly terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(i), Parent will pay (or cause to be paid) to the Company the Parent Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of termination of this Agreement. Any payment of the Parent Termination Fee will be made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by the Company.   (f)    Each of the Parties acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 8.4 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the Other Party would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the Parties further acknowledges that the payment of the Company Termination Fee by the Company or the Parent Termination Fee by Parent is not a penalty, but, is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, in the case of the payment of the Company Termination Fee, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the case of payment of the Parent Termination Fee, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due by it pursuant to this Section 8.4, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal  in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. If, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company commences a Proceeding that results in judgment for Parent, or the Company, as applicable, the non-prevailing party shall pay the other party its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such Proceeding.   (g)    Subject in all respects to Parent’s rights set forth in Section 9.9 and the reimbursement obligations of the Company under Section 8.4(f), in the event the Company Termination Fee is paid to Parent in circumstances for which such fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.4(a), 8.4(b) or 8.4(c), payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the Parent Related Parties against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, financing sources, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any losses or damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only the Company shall be liable for damages for such fraud or Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, the Company Related Parties shall not have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated or (iii) any breach (or threatened or alleged breach) of, or failure (or threatened or alleged failure) to perform under, this Agreement or any of the other documents delivered herewith or executed in connection herewith or otherwise, except for the liability of the Company in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation.   70

(i)    In connection with any losses or damages suffered by any Parent Related Party as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, other than in the circumstances in which Parent is entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.4(a), Section 8.4(b) or Section 8.4(c) (in which case, Section 8.4(h) shall apply), and without limiting the reimbursement obligations of the Company under Section 8.4(f), Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and the Parent Related Parties, that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of the Company and the Company Related Parties, if any, shall be limited to the amount of the Company Termination Fee, and in no event shall Parent or any Parent Related Party seek or be entitled to recover from the Company or any Company Related Parties, and Parent on behalf of itself and the Parent Related Parties hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes any right to seek or recover, any monetary damages in the aggregate in excess of such amount, including for the liability of the Company in the case of fraud.    (j)    In connection with any losses or damages suffered by any Company Related Party as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or under the Guarantee or Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise, other than in circumstances i n which the Company is entitled to receive the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.4(e) (in which case Section 8.4(h) shall apply), the Company agrees, on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties (including the Company Stockholder), that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of Parent and the Parent Related Parties (including the Guarantor) shall be limited to $133,000,000, and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party (including the Company Stockholder) seek or be entitled to recover from Parent or any Parent Related Parties (including the Guarantor), and the Company o n behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties (including the Company Stockholder) hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes any right to seek or recover, any monetary damages in the aggregate in excess of such amount, including for the liability of Parent or Merger Sub in the case of fraud.   (k)    As used herein, “Company Termination Fee” means a cash amount equal to $59,000,000, and (ii) “Parent Termination Fee” means a cash amount equal to $127,000,000.   (l)     In no event shall (i) Parent be entitled to receive more than one payment of the Company Termination Fee in connection with this Agreement or (ii) the Company be entitled to receive more than one payment of the Parent Termination Fee in connection with this Agreement.   (m)   While Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.9 and the payment of the Company Termination Fee under this Section 8.4, under no circumstances shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the consummation of the Merger and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee. While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.9 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this Section 8.4, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the consummation of the Merger and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.   71

   Section 9.5    Entire Understanding: No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents and instruments executed pursuant hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the matters therein and herein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings on such matters. The provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and, subject to Section 9.4, their respective successors and assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors except following the Effective Time, (i) as provided in Section 6.11 (which will be to the benefit of the Persons referred to in such Section), (ii) the rights of holders of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration and (iii) the rights of holders of Company SARs, Company RSUs and Company PSUs to receive such amounts as provided for in Section 3.2.    Section 9.6    Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions of this Agreement in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. If a final Judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the economic, business or other intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.    Section 9.7    Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.   (a)    This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at Law, in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof that would result in the application of any other jurisdiction’s Laws.   74

   (b)    The Parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over such matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware) in connection with any dispute that arises in respect of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement or in respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for interpretation or enforcement hereof or any such document that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively by such a Delaware state or federal court. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with such action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.3 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.   (c)    EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER, OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.7.   Section 9.8    No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or Representative of any Party hereto has any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions.    Section 9.9    Specific Performance.   (a)    The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the parties. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over such matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance and further agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each Party further agrees that neither the Other Party nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.9, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.    75

   (b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is acknowledged and agreed that Parent has an obligation hereunder to cause the Financing to be funded, including by exercising its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and such obligation of Parent will be subject to the requirements set forth in clause (A) below, and the right of the Company to specific performance in connection with enforcing such obligation of Parent and the Company’s third-party beneficiary rights under the Equity Commitment Letter will be subject to the requirements that (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the time the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Financing to be funded and continues to be satisfied); (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to Section 2.2; and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur (and the Company has not revoked, withdrawn, modified or conditioned such irrevocable confirmation), and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within three (3) Business Days after delivery of the Company’s irrevocable written confirmation. The election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate the Agreement and pursuing any other remedy available at law or equity.   Section 9.10    Tax Matters.   (a )      All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, when due and expressly shall not be a liability of the holders of Company Common Stock.    (b )     On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certification from the Company pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c) dated no more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and signed by a responsible corporate officer of the Company, together with a signed notice as contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h), which Parent shall be entitled to file with the Internal Revenue Service after the Closing.   Section 9.11    Survival. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or as of the Effective Time shall survive until (but not beyond) the Effective Time, except for those representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.24 and 5.13 herein. The covenants and agreements of the Parties (including the Surviving Corporation) shall survive the Effective Time without limitation (except for those which, by their terms, contemplate a shorter survival period).    76

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares which are held immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the “Dissenting Shares”) pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Stockholders”), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled only to such rights as are accorded under Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost its right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder’s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with Section 3.1, without interest and subject to deductions of any applicable withholding Tax in accordance with Section 3.2(h). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demand for appraisal or attempted withdrawal of such demand that is received by the Company relating to Company stockholders’ rights of appraisal. Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all demands for appraisal by Company stockholders under the DGCL. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall not voluntarily offer to make, or otherwise negotiate or make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.   17

( h )       Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled, without duplication, to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (i) timely remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) to the extent remitted pursuant to the foregoing subsection (i), treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.   Section 3.3           Treatment of Company Equity Awards.   ( a )        Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or a committee thereof shall take such actions as are necessary to cause (i) the performance conditions of each PRSU to be deemed satisfied at 100% of the relevant target level of achievement (notwithstanding any contrary provision in any agreement or document governing or evidencing the relevant PRSU) and (ii) each Option, PRSU, RSU and share of Restricted Stock to become fully vested and free of any applicable forfeiture restrictions, in each of clauses (i) and (ii), effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (b )         In-the-Money Company Options. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Option Holder, each Option that has a per share exercise price that is less than the Common Merger Consideration, shall not be assumed by Parent and shall instead be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by Parent of an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Option multiplied by (y) the excess of the Common Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of the Option. As of the Effective Time, each Option Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the foregoing consideration. All payments under this Section 3.3(b) shall be made at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, pursuant to the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.   (c)         Out-of-the-Money Company Options. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Option Holder, each Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Common Merger Consideration shall to the extent not exercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled at the Effective Time with no payment made therefor and shall cease to represent a right to purchase shares of Common Stock.   ( d )        RSUs and PRSUs. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any RSU Holder, each RSU and PRSU shall not be assumed by Parent and shall be cancelled and automatically converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration in cash, without interest, for each share of Common Stock subject to the RSU or PRSU. As of the Effective Time, each RSU Holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except to receive the foregoing consideration. All payments under this Section 3.3(d) shall be made at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, pursuant to the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.   18

(e)        Company ESPP. Simultaneously in connection with the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall: (i) cause any offering period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased) in progress under the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement to be the final offering period under the Company ESPP and to be terminated as of the date of this Agreement (the “Final Exercise Date”); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; and (iii) cause each participant’s then-outstanding share purchase right under the Company ESPP (the “Company ESPP Rights”) to terminate as of the Final Exercise Date. Thereafter, the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP no later than the Effective Time. On the Final Exercise Date, to the extent sufficient funds have been credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding accounts for participants to fund a share purchase for a reasonable number of shares, then such funds shall be used to purchase shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and otherwise the current offering period shall terminate without a final purchase.  Each share purchased thereunder prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a), subject to withholding of any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP following the Final Exercise Date shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP (as amended pursuant to this Section 3.3(e)), be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Final Exercise Date (without interest). No further Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP after the Final Exercise Date.   Section 3.4        Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time, shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of Shares, the applicable Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 3.4 shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.   ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct except (i) as set forth in the Company SEC Documents furnished or filed and publicly available two Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Filed Company SEC Documents”) (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading “Risk Factors,” or disclosures of risks set forth in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature); provided, that nothing disclosed in the Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to be a qualification of, or modification to, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1, Section 4.3 or Section 4.8(a) or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent at the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Schedule”).

The Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage with reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such risks as the Company reasonably believes, based on past experience, is adequate for the businesses and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taking into account the cost and availability of such insurance). Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company Insurance Policies (A) are sufficient for compliance by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with all Material Contracts and (B) will not terminate or lapse by their terms by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) there is no claim by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pending under any of the Company Insurance Policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds or in respect of which such underwriters have reserved their rights.

Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ ability to operate in all material respects in the manner they have operated prior to the date hereof, (i) to the Knowledge of the Company, (A) each of the container lease agreements that Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are currently party to with their respective lessees constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation in accordance with container leasing industry practice, of the contractual counterparties that are a party thereto, in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights and to general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), and (B) other than late payments under lease agreements consistent with past practice, none of the contractual counterparties to any such container lease agreements is in material breach or default thereunder (or with notice or lapse of time or both would be in material breach or default there under), (ii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have all right, title and interest in and to, subject to Permitted Liens, the containers, including those subject to such container lease agreements, owned by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any containers acquired by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries after the Balance Sheet Date (other than containers sold or otherwise disposed of after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business) and (iii) except as set forth on Section 4.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any container lease agreement that would require any consent or approval of any third party to (A) any assignment of such lease agreement to any Affiliate of the Company or (B) the consummation of the Transactions, or would result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default) under, such agreement if such consent or approval were not obtained. The cancellation or termination of any container lease agreements for which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries have received a written cancellation or termination notice from the applicable lessee prior to the date of this Agreement would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or the Securitization Vehicle, taken as a whole, or the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ ability to operate in all material respects in the manner they have operated prior to the date hereof. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party to any asset-backed securitization or similar off-balance transactions in which the special purpose vehicle who acquired and holds such agreements is a Person other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary.   36

Section 6.2           Proxy Statement.   ( a )        As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement), the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and file with the SEC in preliminary form a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”) relating to the meeting of the Company’s stockholders held for the purpose of approving and adopting this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Company Stockholders Meeting”). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and such information, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company’s stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and file all necessary amendments thereto in connection with such SEC comments. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall consult with Parent regarding, and provide Parent with copies of, all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response and the Company shall in good faith consider including all such comments proposed by Parent, but the Company shall not be obligated to incorporate any such comments. The Company shall, after the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Record Holders entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be held as soon as reasonably practicable following such mailing (but in no event more than 45 days after the date of such mailing).   ( b )        The Proxy Statement, at the date it is first mailed to the Company’s stockholders, or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not false or misleading in light of the circumstances under which they are made. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligations of the Company with respect to this Section 6.2(b) do not extend to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.   ( c )        If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent (as applicable), should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

Section 6.3       Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall (a) as soon as reasonably practicable following confirmation by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement take all action necessary to set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (b) subject to Section 6.4, include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and thereafter, upon the reasonable request of Parent made not more than one time every week), the Company shall conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act for a record date for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting that is twenty (20) business days after the date of such “broker search.” Unless the Agreement has been duly terminated in accordance with the terms herein, the Company shall, subject to the right of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent under the circumstances specified in Section 6.4, use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the Transactions and to secure the Company Stockholder Approval (it being understood that the foregoing shall not require the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to recommend in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, if a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has been effected in accordance with Section 6.4(d)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as required by applicable Law, (ii) if the Company reasonably believes in good faith that it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that is legally required or may be advisable (including in the event that, and respect of, any objection that is raised by any stockholder of the Company to the sufficiency or accuracy of the Proxy Statement) is timely provided to the stockholders of the Company, or (iii)  if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of the Common Stock (either in person, or by means of remote communication, or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or if on the date of such Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of the Common Stock necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by (and solely pursuant to the terms of) Section 6.4) , the Company shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts to assist in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 10 days after the date for which the then most-recent Company Stockholders Meeting was scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). The Company agrees that no matters shall be brought before the Company Stockholders Meeting other than the proposal to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, the related “golden parachute” vote under Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act and any related and customary procedural matters (including a proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval). The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and proxy tallies following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the holders of the Shares; provided, that the Company shall, upon the request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable proxy solicitor of the Company to advise Parent on a not less than daily basis during the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval.   45

(a)          Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.3(a), the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit its and the Company Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Alternative Proposal or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, or, subject to this Section 6.4(a) or Section 6.4(b): (i) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose or afford access to any non-public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary to, or knowingly assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate, or knowingly encourage any effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, any Alternative Proposal; (ii) except where the Company Board (or a committee thereof) makes a good faith determination, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries; or (iii) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, term sheet or other Contract relating to any Alternative Proposal (each, a “Company Acquisition Agreement”). Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, the Company Board shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, until the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.3(a), the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions, or negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Alternative Proposal, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (and shall send written notice demanding that) any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to return or destroy all such information.   (b)         Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 6.4, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or a committee thereof), directly or indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to Section 6.4(c): (i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party, that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide Alternative Proposal in writing that was not solicited in violation of Section 6.4(a) that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) believes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes or could reasonably be expected t o result in a Superior Proposal; (ii) enter into, and thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries pursuant to, an executed confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of such third party non-public information (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously made available by the Company to Parent) and such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement shall be provided to Parent substantially contemporaneously); (iii) following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, and subject to Section 6.4(d) and Section 6.4(f), make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.3(a); or (iv) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take (which order remains unstayed), but, in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), only if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or in violation of any Order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position under Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Alternative Proposal, if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law; provided, that, any such disclosure that would otherwise constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall only be made in accordance with Section 6.4(d) or Section 6.4(e), as applicable.   46

(c)          Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 6.4(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in no event later than one Business Day) after it obtains (i) knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Alternative Proposal, (ii) any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries by any third party in connection with an Alternative Proposal. In such notice, the Company shall identify the third party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or material proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof.   (d)        Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, neither the Company Board or any committee thereof shall effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) the Company notifies Parent, in writing, at least four Business Days (the “Superior Proposal Notice Period”) before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) and entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received an Alternative Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) the Company attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement reflecting the Superior Proposal and any material documents related thereto, and summarizes in reasonable detail any material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal that are not reflected in the proposed agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and the identity of the third party making such Superior Proposal; (iii) during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith, and causes its Representatives to negotiate with Parent in good faith, to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Alternative Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes in good faith to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Superior Proposal Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including any revision in price, the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three Business Days remain in the Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision); and (iv) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Superior Proposal Notice Period to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.   47

(e)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4(a)-(d), but subject to Section 6.4 and the last sentence of this Section 6.4(e), prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if : (i) an Intervening Event occurs, (ii) the Company Board (or such committee) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) prior to effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least two Business Days (the “Company Adverse Recommendation Notice Period”) before taking such action of the Company Board’s (or such committee’s) intent to consider such action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), and which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to the Intervening Event, and the reasons the Company Board (or such committee) proposes to take such action; (iv) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Company Adverse Recommendation Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the underlying facts giving rise to the Intervening Event, and the reasons the Company Board (or such committee) proposes to take such action, cease to constitute circumstances causing the Company Board to propose making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes in good faith to make such adjustments; and (v) the Company Board (or such committee) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor and taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Company Adverse Recommendation Notice Period, that the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that any Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected (or proposed to be effected) in response to or in connection with any Alternative Proposal may be made solely and exclusively pursuant to Section 6.4(d) only, and may not be made pursuant to this Section 6.4(e), and any Company Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made pursuant to this Section 6.4 and no other provisions of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any event, change, effect, development or occurrence, or any consequence thereof, that becomes known to the Company Board after the date of this Agreement that (i) was not known, (or if known, the consequences of which were not reasonably foreseeable), to the Company Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this Agreement by the Company and (ii) does not relate to or involve an Alternative Proposal.   (f)         Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with Article VIII (including by the Company under Section 8.3(a)), this Agreement shall be submitted to Company’s shareholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger) and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Company of such obligation; provided, however, that if the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (i) with respect to a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may recommend approval of such Superior Proposal by the shareholders of Company or (ii) based on a Intervening Event, then the Company Board may submit this Agreement to Company’s shareholders without recommendation, in which event the Company Board shall communicate the basis for its recommendation of such Superior Proposal or the basis for its lack of a recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to Company’s shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.   48

The foregoing notwithstanding, to the extent there is a conflict between this Section 6.5 and Section 6.17 with respect to actions to be taken in connection with the Migration, Section 6.17 shall control and govern.

Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other under this Section 6.5(b) as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(b), Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court with respect to the Transactions by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority.   49

( a )         For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and any person who becomes an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time (each, an “Indemnified Person”), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and any fees, costs and expenses (including the reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel of the respective Indemnified Person’s choosing) incurred or arising in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Person’s service as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary at or prior to the Effective Time, or services performed by such Indemnified Person, at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan, in each case to the extent they arise out of (i) matters existing or occurring or alleged to have existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) matters related to this Agreement and the Transactions and (iii) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Person. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (A) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding within 20 Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from such Indemnified Person of a request therefor, provided that if required under the DGCL, the Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, and (B) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such matter.   (b)       For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws.   ( c )         Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall obtain, and fully pay the premium for, a non-cancelable extension of the Company’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the “D&O Insurance”) in place as of the date hereof, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time and on terms and conditions and with retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as those contained in the Company’s D&O Insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof; provided that if the aggregate cost for such insurance coverage in respect of any one policy year exceeds 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall instead be obligated to obtain D&O Insurance with the best available coverage with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate cost in respect of each policy year within such six-year period of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company.   ( d )        Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the Transactions) now existing in favor of any Indemnified Person as provided in any agreement in effect on the date hereof (and made available to Parent prior to the date hereof) between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Indemnified Person, on the other hand, will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation without further action, as of the Effective Time, and will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.   (e)         If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.   52

( a )         Effective as of, and continuing for a period of not less than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, shall provide or cause each Continuing Employee to be provided with (i) base salary or wages that are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (iii) if applicable, RSUs and PRSUs, or a cash-based incentive award equivalent thereto, with an aggregate grant date fair value no less favorable than the aggregate grant date fair value of the RSU and/or PRSUs provided to such Continuing Employee in 2021; and (iv) other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (other than any defined benefit pension and post-employment or retirement medical and welfare benefits, retention, change in control, transaction, stay or similar arrangements, or long-term incentive or equity-based compensation opportunities or benefits (other than as expressly provided under this Section 6.11(a)).   (b)        With respect to any employee benefit plan, program, practice, policy or arrangement maintained or contributed to by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date (each, a “Parent Benefit Plan”), for the purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for (i) benefit accrual purposes (except for vacation, sick leave, paid time off and severance) or (ii) vesting under any equity compensation plan, as applicable), such Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entity thereof) prior to the Closing Date shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Continuing Employee was entitled, immediately before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under any analogous Company Benefit Plan; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that it would result in any duplication of benefits or compensation.   (c)         Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates will use reasonable best efforts to cause each Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) to waive any and all eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements, evidence of insurability requirements, pre-existing condition limitations and other exclusions and limitations regarding the Continuing Employees and their spouses, domestic partners and dependents to the extent waived, satisfied or not applicable under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) to recognize for each Continuing Employee for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent Benefit Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents under the analogous Company Benefit Plan during the plan year of such Company Benefit Plan in which the Closing Date occurs.   53

The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the applicable Company Benefit Plans have been timely terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board and, as applicable, any Company Subsidiary. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned o r delayed.

(e)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates to relocate or terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) prevent the amendment, modification, or termination of any agreement with a Continuing Employee after the Effective Time; or (iii) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement or otherwise be treated as an adoption of, or amendment or modification of, any Company Benefit Plan, any benefit plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other benefit plan arrangement. No provision of this Agreement shall confer upon any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (including any current or former Service Provider or any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereto)) any third party beneficiary or other right of any kind or nature whatsoever, except that the Company may enforce these provisions on behalf of any impacted Continuing Employee.

Section 9.3        Assignment; Binding Effect; Benefit. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors. Except for the provisions of Section 6.10 and this Section 9.3, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and respective successors and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (i) the right of the stockholders of the Company to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim that may not be made unless and until the Effective Time shall have occurred), and (ii) the rights of the holders of Options, RSUs and PRSUs to receive the amounts set forth in and pursuant to Section 3.3 (a claim that may not be made unless and until the Effective Time shall have occurred). The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.4 without notice or liability to any Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.   Section 9.4        Extension; Waivers . At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party may, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or parties hereto (as applicable), (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made by any other party hereto contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of any other party hereto contained herein; provided that any agreement by a party to any such waiver or extension shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing duly executed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. Subject to the foregoing, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, or delay or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any party as a result of any breach or default hereunder by any other party shall be deemed to impair any such right power or remedy, nor will it be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.   Section 9.5          Amendments. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their boards of directors, at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which by Law requires further approval by the holders the Company’s capital stock. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing duly executed by each of the parties hereto.   Section 9.6        Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement among the parties and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Each exhibit and schedule to this Agreement will be considered incorporated into this Agreement.   Section 9.7          Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the parties hereto.   Section 9.8          Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement, to the extent possible, in such a manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable but so as to retain most nearly the intent of the parties as expressed herein, and if such a modification is not possible, that provision will be severed from this Agreement, and all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any party.   67

Section 9.9          Governing Law. This Agreement and any controversy related to or arising, directly or indirectly, out of, caused by or resulting from this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.   Section 9.10         Enforcement of Agreement.   (a)          The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger and the Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and hereby agree that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement.   ( b )         Each of the parties agrees that it will not raise any objection to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief as provided herein, including objections on the basis that (i) either party has an adequate remedy at law or equity or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Order or injunction. The remedies available to each party pursuant to this Section 9.10 shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit either party hereto from, terminating this Agreement and collecting the Parent Termination Fee or Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to Section 8.6 in the event that specific performance is not granted. The parties hereto further agree that nothing set forth in this Section 9.10 shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for specific performance under this Section 9.10 prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VIII (or receipt of any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.6), nor shall the commencement of any legal action or legal proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.10 or anything set forth in this Section 9.10 restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII.   Section 9.11         Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue.(a)           Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of Delaware, or the Federal court of the United States of America located in the District of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to or to enforce this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or any of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (b) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware state court or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, in such Federal court, (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware state or Federal court, and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware state or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.  Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.2.  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.   68

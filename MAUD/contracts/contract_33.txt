(iv) No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Article III. 


(v) With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.5(h)) and dividends or other distributions with respect to New PubCo Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.5(g) is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.5(h)) and dividends or other distributions with respect to New PubCo Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.5(g) to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of New PubCo that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Certificates are presented to New PubCo, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.5(h)) and dividends or other distributions with respect to New PubCo Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.5(g) payable in respect of the Eligible Shares previously represented by such Certificates. 


(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to New PubCo, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.5(h)) and dividends or other distributions with respect to New PubCo Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.5(g), in each case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and New PubCo for payment of their claim for such amounts. 


(e) No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, New PubCo, C Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Isla, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(f) Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by New PubCo, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as New PubCo may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration (including any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.5(h)) and dividends or other distributions with respect to New PubCo Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.5(g) payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.   18

(g) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock with a record date after the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the whole shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in each case, until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.5 or, if such Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, such holder shall have delivered the affidavit and, if reasonably required by New PubCo, posted the bond, in accordance with Section 3.5(f). Following surrender of any such Certificate (or, if applicable, delivery of such affidavit and, if reasonably required by New PubCo, posting of such bond), there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender (or delivery, as applicable), the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender (or delivery, as applicable) and a payment date subsequent to such surrender (or delivery, as applicable) payable with respect to such whole shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock, all whole shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Merger Effective Time. 


(h) No Fractional Shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of New PubCo or a holder of shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock. In lieu of any fractional share of New PubCo Class A Common Stock to which any holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled in connection with the payment of the Merger Consideration, the holders of Eligible Shares shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.5(h), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of New PubCo Class A Common Stock representing such holder’s proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Agreement over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares New PubCo Class A Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Eligible Shares pursuant to Section 3.2. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Eligible Shares in lieu of any fractional shares of New PubCo Class A Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Eligible Shares, without interest, subject to and in accordance with this Section 3.5.   19

To the extent that such amounts are so properly deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect to which such amounts would have been paid absent such deduction or withholding.

Without the prior written consent of Isla (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as required by applicable Law, (i) the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than a non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger and matters of procedure) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company shall not submit any other proposal to such stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise (including any proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement) and (ii) the Company shall not call any meeting of the stockholders of the Company other than the Company Stockholders Meeting; provided, that, the Company may (A) amend any Company Equity Plan in order to effectuate, and (B) submit a proposal to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company other than the Company Stockholders Meeting for approval of, in each case, without the prior written consent of Isla, the issuance of additional shares under such Company Equity Plan in an amount necessary to effectuate the treatment of any Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company PSU Awards, or Company Stock Option Awards pursuant to Section 3.4; provided, further, that, solely to the extent that it is determined under the applicable rules of the NYSE that the adoption of the Equity Incentive Plan requires the approval of the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise, then the Company shall adopt an amendment to any Company Equity Plan that provides an for additional share reserve for issuance following the Merger Effective Time in an amount equivalent to up to 2% of the total outstanding New PubCo Class A Common Stock and shall submit a proposal to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company other than the Company Stockholders Meeting for approval of such amendment (it being understood that the approval of any such proposal shall not be a condition to Closing with respect to any Party). 


(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the Company agrees that its obligations to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation and, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Section 6.5, its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the commencement, announcement, disclosure, or communication to the Company of any Company Competing Proposal or other proposal (including a Company Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or disclosure of any Company Intervening Event.   83

shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access as can be provided in a manner without risking the health and safety of such Persons or violating such COVID-19 Measures). Isla and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing: 


(i) No Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information, as applicable, to the other Party or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information is regarding the value of the transaction or is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such information, as applicable, is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing contract or agreement (provided, however, the Company or Isla, as applicable, shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Isla shall reasonably cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through the use of commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party required to provide such information and (B) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the Parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege); 


(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall not be permitted to conduct any invasive or intrusive sampling or analysis (commonly known as a Phase II) of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of the other Party or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the other Party (which may be granted or withheld in such other Party’s sole discretion); and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to, and none of the Parties may, nor shall any of them permit their Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, take any action that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation or amortization of New PubCo and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from and after the Closing. 


(c) The Isla Parties and the Company shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay in any material respect the expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, or any consent or approval required pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust Laws. 


6.8 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. 


(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Merger Effective Time, New PubCo and the Surviving Person shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless, in the same manner as provided by the Company or by Isla, as applicable, immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Merger Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company, of Isla or any of their respective Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Plan or any equivalent plan of Isla, in each case, when acting in such capacity (the “Indemnified Persons”) against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company, of Isla or any of their respective Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Plan or any equivalent plan of Isla or is or was serving at the request of the Company, of Isla or any of   87








________________


their respective Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise, as applicable, or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, but not after, the Merger Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, but not after, the Merger Effective Time (“Indemnified Liabilities”), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and New PubCo and the Surviving Person shall jointly and severally pay expenses incurred in connection therewith in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Merger Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the Company’s, Isla’s or New PubCo’s regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, and New PubCo and the Surviving Person shall jointly and severally pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) New PubCo and the Surviving Person shall use their reasonable best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.8, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify New PubCo and the Surviving Person (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.8 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such Party’s position with respect to such claims). With respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by New PubCo and the Surviving Person under this Section 6.8, such Indemnified Person shall have the right to require that such determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by New PubCo (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services for the Company, Isla, the Series I Preferred Stockholder or the Indemnified Person within the last three (3) years. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided in Section 6.8(c), this Section 6.8(a) shall not require New PubCo or the Surviving Person to indemnify, defend or hold harmless, or advance expenses to any Indemnified Person in connection with any Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnified Person. 


(b) New PubCo, the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Person, as applicable, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity or Surviving Person in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity, Surviving Person or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Merger Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Isla or any of its Subsidiaries, to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by applicable Law. New PubCo shall cause the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Person to fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Isla or any of its Subsidiaries, and any of its directors or officers existing and in effect prior to the date of this Agreement.   88








________________


(c) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, New PubCo and the Surviving Person shall indemnify any Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in Section 6.8(a), relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Person’s rights under this Section 6.8 or under any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder. 


(d) Unless Isla and the Company agree in writing prior to the Merger Effective Time that retroactive coverage that is mutually satisfactory to Isla and the Company shall be obtained and prepaid in full by New PubCo or its Affiliate in connection with a director and officer liability insurance policy of New PubCo or the Surviving Person will cause to be put in place, and New PubCo or one of its Affiliates shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, “tail” insurance policies in favor of the Company’s Indemnified Persons with a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from the Merger Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s or Isla’s current insurance carrier, as applicable, with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company’s or Isla’s existing policies, as applicable, with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at, prior to, or after, the Merger Effective Time; provided, that in no event shall New PubCo and its Subsidiaries, collectively, be required to spend in the aggregate more than 300% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by the Company or Isla or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) for fiscal year 2020 for such purpose for the six years of coverage under such insurance policy, it being understood that New PubCo and its Subsidiaries, collectively, shall nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount. 


(e) In the event that New PubCo or the Surviving Person or any of their respective successors or assignees (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of New PubCo or the Surviving Person, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this Section 6.8, and his heirs and Representatives. The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.8 are in addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Law. New PubCo and the Surviving Person shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.8, unless it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to such indemnity.   89

6.9 Transaction Litigation. Except for any Proceeding taken by any Antitrust Authority which shall be subject to Sections 6.7(b) and 6.7(c), in the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company or Isla, as applicable, threatened, that questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, including stockholder litigation (“Transaction Litigation”), the Company or Isla, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other Party of such Transaction Litigation and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Isla a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, at Isla’s sole cost and expense, and shall consider in good faith Isla’s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation (it being agreed and acknowledged that the Company shall have the right to conduct the defense of such Transaction Litigation); provided that the Company shall not offer or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Isla. 


6.10 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by the Parties. No Party shall, and each will cause its Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior written approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures (a) required by applicable Law, (b) required by the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party’s or its Subsidiary’s capital stock is traded or (c) consistent with the final form of the joint press release announcing the Merger and the investor presentation given to investors on the morning of announcement of the Merger; provided, in each case, such Party uses commercially reasonable efforts to afford the other Party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comments thereon; and provided, however, that no provision this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner a Party’s ability to communicate with its employees and, with respect to Isla, its Affiliates and their respective limited partners, members, officers, employees, directors, advisors or representatives (provided, that prior to making any written communications to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Transactions, the Company shall provide Isla with a copy of the intended communication, the Company shall provide Isla a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider any timely comments in good faith) and that the Company shall not be required by any provision of this Agreement to consult with or obtain any approval from any other party with respect to a public announcement or press release issued in connection with the receipt and existence of a Company Competing Proposal, and matters related thereto or a Company Change of Recommendation, other than as set forth in Section 6.3. 


6.11 Advice of Certain Matters; Control of Business. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, the Company and Isla, as the case may be, shall confer on a regular basis with each other and shall promptly advise each other orally and in writing of any change or event having, or which would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Isla Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. Except with respect to Antitrust Laws as provided in Section 6.7, prior to the Closing, the Company and Isla shall promptly provide each other (or their respective counsel) copies of all filings made by such Party or its Subsidiaries with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with this   90

Agreement and the Transactions. Without limiting in any way any Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party and their respective Subsidiaries’ operations prior to the Merger Effective Time. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, each of the Parties shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations. 


6.12 Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification. Except to the extent that the Parties’ obligations are specifically set forth elsewhere in this Article VI:

(b) subject to applicable Law and as otherwise required by any Governmental Entity, the Company and Isla each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the consummation of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Isla or the Company, as applicable, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions (including those alleging that the approval or consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions). The Company shall give prompt notice to Isla, and Isla shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming aware of (i) any condition, event or circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) not being met, or (ii) the failure by such Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. 


6.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, New PubCo and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of New PubCo (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to New PubCo, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

6.15 Stock Exchange Listing and Delisting. New PubCo shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the New PubCo Class A Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and issuable in connection with the Transactions (including upon exchange of the OpCo Units) to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Merger Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with New PubCo and use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and rules and policies of the NYSE American and the NYSE, as applicable, to enable the approval for listing on the NYSE American or the NYSE of the New PubCo Class A Common Stock and the delisting by the Surviving Corporation or Surviving Entity of the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE American and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten days after the Merger Effective Time. If the Surviving Corporation or Surviving Entity is required to file any quarterly or annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act by a filing deadline that is imposed by the Exchange Act and which falls on a date within the 15 days following the Closing Date, the Company shall make available to Isla, at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a substantially final draft of any such annual or quarterly report reasonably likely to be required to be filed during such period. Prior to Closing, (i) to the extent necessary to satisfy any listing requirements of the NYSE, Isla and the Company shall cooperate in good faith and shall agree (such agreement on the part of each such party, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to equitably adjust the Exchange Ratio and the Isla Ownership Number for all purposes of this Agreement by amendment hereof (preserving the economic allocation contemplated by the Exchange Ratio and Isla Ownership number set forth herein as of the date hereof) and (ii) to the extent that the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on June 4, 2021 was not 201,071,407 and a different number is confirmed by the Company’s transfer agent in writing within 2 Business Days of the date hereof (or such later date as is approved by Isla in its sole discretion), the Exchange Ratio and the Isla Ownership Number shall automatically be equitably adjusted for all purposes of this Agreement to preserve the economic allocation contemplated by the Exchange Ratio and Isla Ownership number set forth herein as of the date hereof (which is based on 201,071,407 issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock). The Company shall cause the Company’s transfer agent to deliver the information described in the immediately preceding sentence within 2 Business Days of the date hereof. 


6.16 Tax Characterization and Other Tax Matters. 


(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state or local income tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the Parties intend that: 


(i) the Merger and the LLC Merger, taken together, qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; 


(ii) Isla continue as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 708(a) of the Code following the Closing Date (and therefore OpCo be treated as a continuation of Isla for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Closing Date); and   92








________________


(iii) the Contribution be treated as a contribution of assets and liabilities by New PubCo to OpCo (as the continuing Isla tax partnership) in a contribution described in Section 721(a) of the Code (such treatment in clauses (a)(i) through (iii), the “Intended Tax Treatment”). 


(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the Parties hereto adopt this Agreement as, a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). 


(c) Each of Isla and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Transactions to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. Each of the Parties will notify the other Party promptly after becoming aware of any reason to believe that the Transactions may not qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. The Parties shall prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and, except to the extent otherwise required by a final “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, shall take no Tax position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment.

(a) For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, New PubCo shall cause it or one of its Subsidiaries to provide each individual who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date (each, a “Company Employee”) and who continues employment with New PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date with a base salary or wage rate and employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the base salary or wage rate and employee benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. 


(b) From and after the Closing Date, New PubCo or its Subsidiaries shall take commercially reasonable efforts to credit each Company Employee’s service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and severance and vacation benefit accrual (but not for purposes of defined benefit pension accrual or post-employment retiree welfare benefits) with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans of New PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate after the Closing Date, to the extent that such service was recognized under a corresponding Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service. 


(c) For purposes of each Employee Benefit Plan of New PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate after the Closing Date, New PubCo shall take commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods, evidence of insurability and actively-at-work requirements to be waived for each Company Employee and their covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) give full credit for all co-payments, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket requirements and deductibles to the extent satisfied in the plan year in which the Closing occurs as if there had been a single continuous employer. 


(d) Effective as of the day prior to the Closing but contingent upon the Closing, the Company shall cause to be approved board resolutions terminating the Company 401(k) Plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”) unless Isla provides written notice to the Company that the Company 401(k) Plan shall not be terminated. Unless Isla provides such written notice to the Company, the Company shall provide Isla copies of such board resolutions. Effective as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, each Company Employee shall be eligible to participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or designated by New PubCo or its Affiliates (the “New PubCo 401(k) Plan”), subject to the terms and conditions of the New PubCo 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable after the Closing and to the extent not prohibited under applicable Law, New PubCo shall take all action necessary to provide that each Company Employee may elect to rollover his or her full account balance in the Company 401(k) Plan in cash to the New PubCo 401(k) plan.   94

For the sake of clarity, the foregoing proviso shall not in any way limit the rights of any participants in any Company severance plan or policy as in effect as of the date hereof. 


(f) In determining the amount of discretionary annual incentive bonuses for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, New PubCo shall consider and provide credit for, in good faith, periods of service by each Company Employee for the portion of such calendar year that that precedes the Closing Date. 


(g) This Section 6.18 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this Section 6.18, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer upon any other Person (including any current or former Company Employee, directors, officers, or consultants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, on or after the Closing, New PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever, (ii) is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any Company Plan or any other Employee Benefit Plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of New PubCo, the Company or any respective Subsidiary thereof or (iii) obligates New PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries to retain the employment of any Company Employee or a service relationship with any other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing. 


6.19 Payoff Letter. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Isla from each holder (or administrative agent or other authorized representative of such holders) of Subject Indebtedness that will be outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, a copy of a payoff letter in form reasonably satisfactory to Isla, setting forth the total amounts payable to each such holder (or the aggregate amounts payable to the administrative agent or other authorized representative of such holders for the account of such holders) of such Subject Indebtedness to fully satisfy all outstanding principal, interest, Debt Prepayment Expenses, and all outstanding fees, costs and expenses payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of such Subject Indebtedness as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual thereafter), together with appropriate wire instructions, and the agreement of each such holder of Subject Indebtedness that upon payment in full of all such amounts owed to such holder (which amounts shall be paid in full at the Closing in accordance with such Payoff Letters by New PubCo or an Affiliate thereof) the loan documents shall be terminated with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries that are borrowers or guarantors thereof (or the assets or equity of which secure such Indebtedness) and such holder shall release and terminate all Encumbrances on the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective assets and equity securing such Subject Indebtedness (the “Payoff Letters”), together with any applicable documents necessary to evidence the release and termination of all Encumbrances on the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective assets and equity securing, and any guarantees by the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of, such Subject Indebtedness. 


6.20 Financing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Isla such cooperation reasonably requested by Isla, and which is customarily provided by similarly situated Persons engaging in similar transactions, in connection with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its assets and any proposed   95

Each Party accordingly agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.11. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Isla in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No waiver by any of the parties hereto of any default, misrepresentation or breach of representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

Dividends and other distributions shall not be declared or paid on the Class B Common Stock unless (i) the dividend consists of shares of Class B Common Stock or of rights, options, warrants or other securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable or redeemable for shares of Class B Common Stock and in each case is paid proportionally with respect to each outstanding share of Class B Common Stock and (ii) a dividend consisting of shares of Class A Common Stock or of rights, options, warrants or other securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable or redeemable for shares of Class A Common Stock on equivalent terms is simultaneously paid to the holders of Class A Common Stock. If dividends are declared on the Class A Common Stock and/or the Class B Common Stock that are payable in shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable or redeemable for Common Stock, the dividends payable to the holders of Class A Common Stock shall be paid only in shares of Class A Common Stock (or   3

In no event shall the shares of either Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock be paid a dividend consisting of voting securities or be split, divided, or combined unless the outstanding shares of the other class shall be paid a proportionate dividend consisting of voting securities or be proportionately split, divided or combined, as applicable.

All shares of Class A Common Stock that shall be issued or disposed upon any such redemption will, upon issuance or disposition in accordance with the LLC Agreement, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Indemnitee (as hereinafter defined) shall have the right to engage in businesses of every type and description and other activities for profit and to engage in and possess an interest in other business ventures of any and every type or description, whether in businesses engaged in or anticipated to be engaged in by any Group Member, independently or with others, including business interests and activities in direct competition with the business and activities of any Group Member, and none of the same shall constitute a violation of this Certificate of Incorporation or any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise to any Group Member or any stockholder of the Corporation. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, no Group Member or any stockholder of the Corporation shall have any rights by virtue of this Certificate of Incorporation, the DGCL or otherwise in any business ventures of any Indemnitee, and the Corporation hereby waives and renounces any interest or expectancy therein.

INDEMNIFICATION, ADVANCEMENT AND LIABILITY OF INDEMNITEES 


Section 11.01 Limitation of Director Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Article XI, or the adoption of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article XI, shall not adversely affect its application with respect to an act or omission by a director or any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal. 


Section 11.02 Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. 


(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “proceeding”) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation (including Indemnitee’s service, while a director or officer of the Corporation, at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter, an “Indemnitee”), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action (or omission) in his or her official capacity as an Indemnitee, against all liability and loss suffered (including, without limitation, judgments, fines, excise taxes pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (the “ERISA excise taxes”), penalties and amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding, all on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 11.02 and the Corporation’s Bylaws. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.02(a), except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors, or if the Board of Directors otherwise determines that indemnification or advancement of expenses is appropriate. 


(b) To receive indemnification under this Section 11.02, an Indemnitee shall submit a written request to the Corporation. Such request shall include documentation or information that is necessary to determine the entitlement of the Indemnitee to indemnification and that is reasonably available to the Indemnitee. Upon receipt by the Corporation of such a written request, unless indemnification is required by Section 11.02(e), the entitlement of the Indemnitee to indemnification shall be determined by the following person or persons who shall be empowered to make such determination, as selected by the Board of Directors (except with respect to clause (v) of this Section 11.02(b)): (i) the Board of Directors by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such proceeding, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; (ii) a committee   8








________________


of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum; (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee; (iv) the stockholders of the Corporation; or (v) in the event that a change of control (as defined below) has occurred, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee. The determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be made and, unless a contrary determination is made, such indemnification shall be paid in full by the Corporation not later than 60 days after the later of (x) the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for indemnification and (y) the final adjudication (as defined below) of the proceeding for which indemnification is sought. For purposes of this Section 11.02(b), a “change of control” will be deemed to have occurred if, with respect to any particular 24-month period, the individuals who, at the beginning of such 24-month period, constituted the Board of Directors (the “incumbent board”), cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the beginning of such 24-month period whose election, or nomination for election by the stockholders of the Corporation, was approved by the Series I Preferred Stockholder or by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the incumbent board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the incumbent board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board of Directors. 


(c) The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, solely to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a “final adjudication”) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 11.02 or otherwise. 


(d) To receive an advancement of expenses under this Section 11.02, an Indemnitee shall submit a written request to the Corporation. Such request shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee and shall include or be accompanied by the undertaking required by Section 11.02(c). Each such advancement of expenses shall be made within 20 days after the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for advancement of expenses. 


(e) To the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding (or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein), such Indemnitee shall be indemnified under this Section 11.02(e) against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such defense. Indemnification under this Section 11.02(e) shall not be subject to satisfaction of a standard of conduct, and the Corporation may not assert the failure to satisfy a standard of conduct as a basis to deny indemnification or recover amounts advanced, including in a suit brought pursuant to Section 11.02(f)   9








________________


(notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein); provided, however, that, any Indemnitee who is not a current or former director or officer (as such term is defined in the final sentence of Section 145(c)(1) of the DGCL) shall be entitled to Indemnification under Section 11.02(a) and this Section 11.02(e) only if such Indemnitee has satisfied the standard of conduct required for indemnification under Section 145(a) or Section 145(b) of the DGCL. 


(f) In the event that a determination is made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or if payment is not timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02(b), if a request for indemnification under Section 11.02(e) is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after the later of (x) the Corporation’s receipt of a written request and (y) the final adjudication of the proceeding for which indemnification is sought, or if an advancement of expenses is not timely made under Section 11.02(d), the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in the Court of Chancery of the state of Delaware (or solely to the extent that the Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any other state or federal court located in the State of Delaware) a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking an adjudication of entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for indemnification set forth in Section 145(a) or Section 145(b) of the DGCL. Further, in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for indemnification set forth in Section 145(a) or Section 145(b) of the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met such applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under applicable law, this Section 11.02 or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 


(g) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Section 11.02 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be or to serve in the capacity of Indemnitee and shall inure to the benefit of such Indemnitee’s heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.   10








________________


(h) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any Indemnitee by this Section 11.02 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. 


(i) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 11.02 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Section 11.02, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision. 


(j) This Section 11.02 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to Persons other than Indemnitees. 


(k) Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.02 shall be made only out of the assets of the Corporation. In no event may an Indemnitee subject any stockholders of the Corporation to personal liability by reason of the provisions set forth in this Certificate of Incorporation with respect to indemnification or any advancement of expenses. Without limiting the foregoing, the Series I Preferred Stockholder shall not be personally liable for such indemnification or any advancement of expenses and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Corporation to enable it to effectuate such indemnification or to advance any expenses. 


(l) Notwithstanding that an Indemnitee may have certain rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses provided by other persons (collectively, the “Other Indemnitors”), with respect to the rights to an advancement of expenses or indemnification set forth herein, the Corporation: (i) shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to such Indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such Indemnitee are secondary); and (ii) shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by such Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all liabilities, without regard to any rights such Indemnitee may have against any of the Other Indemnitors. No advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an Indemnitee with respect to any proceeding for which such Indemnitee has sought an advancement of expenses or indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the immediately preceding sentence, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnitee against the Corporation. 


(m) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.02 to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify any Indemnitee under this Section 11.02 for any amounts paid in settlement of any proceeding effected without the Corporation’s written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   11

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.03; provided, however, that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to proposals as to any business to be considered pursuant to these Bylaws, and compliance with Section 2.03(a) and Section 2.03(b) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder other than the Series I Preferred Stockholder to submit business to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and Section 2.03(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for so long as the Series I Preferred Stockholder shall have the right to submit business and make nominations pursuant to Section 2.03(a), the Series I Preferred Stockholder shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this Section 2.03, except as required by law. 


Section 2.04 Notice of Meetings. If required by law, whenever stockholders are required to take any action at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, a timely notice in writing or by electronic transmission of the meeting, which shall state the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, shall be mailed to or transmitted electronically by the Secretary of the Corporation to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any such notice shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.

At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

The stockholders of the Corporation holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the class or classes entitled to vote at a meeting (including stock of the Corporation deemed owned by the Series I Preferred Stockholder) represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders of such class or classes unless any such action by the stockholders of the Corporation requires approval by stockholders holding a greater percentage of the voting power of such stock, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation duly called and held in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws at which a quorum is present, the act of stockholders holding outstanding stock of the Corporation that in the aggregate   4

The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage of the voting power of outstanding stock of the Corporation specified in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws (including stock of the Corporation deemed owned by the Series I Preferred Stockholder). In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation present and entitled to vote at such meeting (including stock of the Corporation deemed owned by the Series I Preferred Stockholder) represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in Section 2.05 of these Bylaws.

The Board of Directors may make such other regulations consistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws as it may deem necessary or advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the stockholders or solicitation of stockholder action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of ballots, proxies and written consents.

The Corporation may designate one or more Persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the Person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.

EXHIBIT A 


PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 


This Performance Stock Unit Agreement (together with the Grant Notice to which this Agreement is attached, this “Agreement”) is made as of the Date of Grant set forth in the Grant Notice to which this Agreement is attached by and between [IE PubCo Inc.], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and [KKR External Manager], a Delaware limited liability company (the “Participant”). Capitalized terms used but not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Plan or the Grant Notice. 


1. Award. In consideration of the Participant’s past and/or continued service to the Company or its Affiliates and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, effective as of the Date of Grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “Date of Grant”), the Company hereby grants to the Participant the Target PSUs set forth in the Grant Notice on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. To the extent earned and vested, (i) this Award represents the right to receive shares of Common Stock in an amount ranging from 0% to 240% of the Target PSUs and (ii) each Target PSU represents the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 2% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on each Performance Period End Date, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan. Unless and until any portion of this Award vests and becomes earned in the manner set forth in the Grant Notice, the Participant will have no right to receive any Common Stock or other payments in respect of this Award, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement (including Section 4(b)). Prior to settlement of this Award, the Target PSUs and this Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable only from the general assets of the Company. 


2. Earning and Vesting of PSUs. 


(a) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 2(b), the Earned Amount for each Performance Period shall be determined with respect to a single Target PSU for such Performance Period based on the extent to which the Company has satisfied the Performance Goals set forth in the Grant Notice, which shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion following the end of such Performance Period as described in Exhibit B attached hereto. By way of example, (i) if the level of achievement with respect to the Absolute TSR Performance Goal is 145% for a given Performance Period, then the Earned Amount with respect to the 0.6 Target PSU that is subject to the Absolute TSR Performance Goal is equal to 300%, which means that 180% (300% times 0.6) of the Target PSU shall have been earned; (ii) if the level of achievement with respect to the Relative TSR Performance Goal is equal to or greater than the 80th percentile for the same Performance Period, then the Earned Amount with respect to the 0.4 Target PSU that is subject to the Relative TSR Performance Goal is equal to 150%, which means that 60% (150% times 0.4) of the Target PSU shall have been earned; and (iii) the total Earned Amount with respect to the Target PSU for such Performance Period is determined to be 240% (180% plus 60%) of the Target PSU for such Performance Period, which is equivalent to a number of shares of Common Stock equal   A-1








________________


to 4.8% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the applicable Performance Period End Date. To the extent that a Target PSU does not become earned during the corresponding Performance Period, such Target PSU shall be automatically forfeited without further notice and at no cost to the Company. In the event of the termination of that certain Management Agreement among the Company and the Participant, as amended from time to time (the “Management Agreement”) while any Target PSUs remain unearned (but after giving effect to any accelerated vesting pursuant to Section 2(b)), such unearned Target PSUs (and all rights arising from such Target PSUs and from being a holder thereof) will terminate automatically without any further action by the Company and will be forfeited without further notice and at no cost to the Company. 


(b) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Earned Amount with respect to all unearned Target PSUs shall immediately be deemed to be 100% of such Target PSUs on the Control Change Date or the date of liquidation or dissolution, as applicable, if the Management Agreement has not been terminated prior to such Control Change Date or such date of liquidation or dissolution, as applicable. 


3. Settlement of PSUs. As soon as administratively practicable following each Performance Period End Date, but in no event later than 30 days thereafter, the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Earned Amount with respect to the Target PSU for the Performance Period, provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if insufficient shares of Common Stock remain available under the Plan to be delivered in settlement of the Earned Amount, the Company shall deliver to the Participant a cash amount equal to the product of the Fair Market Value on such Performance Period End Date and the number of shares of Common Stock that could not be delivered. All Common Stock issued hereunder shall be delivered either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares to the Participant or by entering such shares in book-entry form, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The value of Common Stock shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time. Neither this Section 3 nor any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed to create a trust or a funded or secured obligation of any kind. 


4. Rights as a Stockholder; Dividends. 


(a) The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Common Stock that may become deliverable hereunder unless and until the Participant has become the holder of record of such Common Stock, and no adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions or other rights in respect of any such Common Stock, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or this Agreement; provided, however, that the Participant shall be entitled to participate in the gains and losses of the Company with respect to the Target PSUs granted hereunder. 


(b) The Participant will have no right to receive any dividends or other distribution with respect to a Target PSU unless and until shares of Common Stock have been delivered in respect of the Earned Amount determined with respect to such Target PSU, if any, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.   A-2








________________


5. Tax Withholding. To the extent that the receipt, vesting or settlement of this Award results in any federal, state, local and/or foreign tax obligations applicable to the Participant, to the extent required under applicable law, the Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of such obligations. 


6. Non-Transferability. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, the Award may not be transferred at any time prior to becoming earned, vested and settled. 


7. Compliance with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the issuance of Common Stock hereunder will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of applicable law with respect to such securities and with the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Common Stock may then be listed. No Common Stock will be issued hereunder if such issuance would constitute a violation of any applicable law or regulation or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Common Stock may then be listed. In addition, Common Stock will not be issued hereunder unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is in effect at the time of such issuance with respect to the shares to be issued or (b) shares to be issued are permitted to be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed to be necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock hereunder will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition to any issuance of Common Stock hereunder, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any requirements that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance as may be requested by the Company. 


8. Legends. If a stock certificate is issued with respect to Common Stock delivered hereunder, such certificate shall bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to reflect the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and to ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any applicable laws or the requirements of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed. If the shares of Common Stock issued hereunder are held in book-entry form, then such entry will reflect that the shares are subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. 


9. Lock-Up Period. If so requested by the Company or any representative of the underwriters in connection with any offering of the Company’s securities (an “Offering”), the Participant (or other holder) shall not sell or otherwise transfer or distribute any Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or any securities convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock or engage in any hedging transactions relating to Common Stock) during such period as may be requested in writing by such underwriters and agreed to in writing by the Company.   A-3

10. Notices. Notices hereunder shall be mailed or delivered to the Company at its principal place of business and shall be mailed or delivered to the Participant at the address on file with the Company or, in either case, at such other address as one party may subsequently furnish to the other party in writing. Any notice that is delivered personally or by overnight courier or telecopier in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to have been duly given to the Participant when it is mailed by the Company or, if such notice is not mailed to the Participant, upon receipt by the Participant. Any notice that is addressed and mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been given to the party to whom it is addressed at the close of business, local time of the recipient, on the fourth day after the day it is so placed in the mail. 


11. Consent to Electronic Delivery; Electronic Signature. In lieu of receiving documents in paper format, the Participant agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to accept electronic delivery of any documents that the Company may be required to deliver (including, but not limited to, prospectuses, prospectus supplements, grant or award notifications and agreements, account statements, annual and quarterly reports and all other forms of communications) in connection with this and any other Award made or offered by the Company. Electronic delivery may be via a Company electronic mail system or by reference to a location on a Company intranet to which the Participant has access. The Participant hereby consents to any and all procedures the Company has established or may establish for an electronic signature system for delivery and acceptance of any such documents that the Company may be required to deliver, and agrees that the Participant’s electronic signature is the same as, and shall have the same force and effect as, the Participant’s manual signature. 


12. Agreement to Furnish Information. The Participant agrees to cause to be furnished to the Company all information requested by the Company to enable it to comply with any reporting or other requirement imposed upon the Company by or under any applicable statute or regulation. 


13. Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement and the provisions of the Management Agreement that relate to this Award constitute the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and contains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to the Target PSUs granted hereby. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, except as provided therein, all prior understandings and agreements, if any, among the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof are hereby null and void and of no further force and effect. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend this Agreement from time to time in any manner that is not inconsistent with the Plan; provided, however, that except as otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement, any such amendment that materially reduces the rights of the Participant shall be effective only if it is in writing and signed by both the Participant and an authorized officer of the Company. 


14. Severability and Waiver. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement or failure to exercise any right hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or right. The failure of any party to take action by reason of such breach or to exercise any such right shall not deprive the party of the right to take action at any time while or after such breach or condition giving rise to such rights continues.   A-4

16. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED THEREIN, EXCLUSIVE OF THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS OF DELAWARE LAW.

This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth herein and in the Plan, this Agreement will be binding upon the Participant and any Affiliate of the Participant to whom the Target PSUs may be transferred.

Absolute TSR (%)   Earned Amount (% of Absolute TSR Portion)* 


<25%   0% 


25%   100% 


55%   150% 


85%   200% 


115%   250% 


145%   300% 


*The Earned Amount for performance between the achievement levels shall be calculated using linear interpolation. 


Calculation of Absolute TSR 


The Company’s Absolute TSR annualized for the applicable Performance Period will be calculated based on the following formula, which shall then be multiplied by 100 such that the result is expressed as a percentage:   


  Exhibit A-6








________________


For purposes of the preceding formula, the following terms shall have the meanings specified below: 


“Beginning Share Price” means (i) with respect to the First Performance Period, the volume-weighted average price per share of Common Stock for the 20 consecutive trading days beginning on and including the First Performance Period Commencement Date or (ii) with respect to each Performance Period other than the First Performance Period, the volume-weighted average price per share of Common Stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the applicable Performance Period Commencement Date. 


“Cumulative Dividends” means the aggregate amount of dividends and other distributions paid on a share of Common Stock during the applicable Performance Period, assuming that such dividends and other distributions were reinvested in the Company as of the applicable ex-dividend dates during the applicable Performance Period.

________________


Determination of Relative TSR 


The total stockholder return for the Company shall be determined using the Absolute TSR formula set forth above. The total stockholder return for each member of the Performance Peer Group will be calculated by dividing (i) (a) the volume-weighted average price per share of such entity’s common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Performance Period End Date minus (b) the volume-weighted average price per share of such entity’s common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the applicable Performance Period Commencement Date plus (c) the aggregate amount of dividends and other distributions paid per share of such entity’s common stock during the applicable Performance Period (assuming that such dividends and other distributions were reinvested in the applicable entity as of the applicable ex-dividend dates during the applicable Performance Period) by (ii) the volume-weighted average price per share of such entity’s common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the applicable Performance Period Commencement Date. 


To determine the Company’s ranking for the Performance Period, total stockholder return will be calculated for the Company and each entity in the Performance Peer Group. The entities will be arranged by their respective total stockholder return (highest to lowest) and the rank of the Company within the Performance Peer Group will be determined. 


Performance Peer Group 


The Company’s “Performance Peer Group” for purposes of this Agreement shall consist of the following companies:   Ticker  Name       


In the event a member of the Performance Peer Group files for bankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency or is delisted due to failure to meet a national securities exchange’s minimum market capitalization requirement, such entity shall continue to be treated as a member of the Performance Peer Group, and the volume-weighted average price per share of such entity’s common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the applicable Performance Period End Date shall be treated as $0 if the common stock of such entity is no longer listed or traded on a national securities exchange on the applicable Performance Period End Date (and if multiple members of the Performance Peer Group file for bankruptcy or liquidate due to an insolvency or are delisted, such members shall be ranked in order of when such bankruptcy, liquidation or delisting occurs, with earlier bankruptcies, liquidations or delistings ranking lower than later bankruptcies, liquidations or delistings).   A-8








________________


In the event of a merger or other business combination involving one member of the Performance Peer Group or the formation of a new parent company by a member of the Performance Peer Group in which, immediately after the transaction, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the surviving, resulting, successor entity, or new parent company, as the case may be, consist of the equity interests in the original member of the Performance Peer Group or the assets and liabilities of the original member of the Performance Peer Group immediately prior to the transaction, the surviving, resulting, successor entity, or new parent company, as the case may be, shall be substituted for the original member of the Performance Peer Group to the extent (and for such period of time) that the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the surviving, resulting, successor entity, or new parent company, as the case may be, is listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock of the original member of the Performance Peer Group is not. In the event of a merger or other business combination of two members of the Performance Peer Group (including, without limitation, the acquisition of one member of the Performance Peer Group, or all or substantially all of its assets, by another member of the Performance Peer Group), the surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Performance Peer Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity securities) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange on the Performance Period End Date. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the volume-weighted average price per share of the applicable entity’s common stock (or similar equity securities) shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent necessary to mitigate the impact of the applicable transaction and preserve the intended incentives of this Award.

Except for any redemption of Units for Class A Shares pursuant to Section 3.6 or for any redemption of Units pursuant to Section 3.1(i), in connection with any redemption or repurchase of Units by the Company for cash or, in the case of any redemption from a Member that is not a member of the PubCo Holdings Group, any other consideration other than Class A Shares (other than a redemption or repurchase of Units held by the Liberty Member for cash or a redemption or repurchase of Units in connection with repurchases of Class A Shares from any Person other than the KKR Manager or its Affiliates under any benefits plan), the Company shall, within ten Business Days of the closing of such redemption or repurchase, make an offer to the Liberty Member to redeem or repurchase a number of Units held by the Liberty Member equal to the Repurchase Percentage of the total number of Units then held by the Liberty Member, at a price per unit equal to the price paid and for the same form of consideration paid by the Company in connection with such redemption or repurchase and the Liberty Member shall have the right to accept such offer within fifteen Business Days of receipt of such offer. For purposes of this Section 3.1(g), “Repurchase Percentage” shall mean a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the total number of Units redeemed or repurchased by the Company as of the relevant date of determination and the denominator of which is (x) if such triggering redemption is of Units held by a Member other than any member of the PubCo Holdings Group, the total number of Units issued and outstanding as of the relevant date of determination (other than any Units held by any member of the PubCo Holdings Group) and (y) if such triggering redemption is of Units held by any member of the PubCo Holdings Group, the total number of Units issued and outstanding as of the relevant date of determination.   26

A Capital Account shall be maintained for each Member in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and, to the extent consistent with such regulations, the other provisions of this Agreement.

The Gross Asset Value of the assets contributed on the Effective Date to the Company by the members of the PubCo Holdings Group shall be calculated by reference to the volume-weighted average sale price of the Class A Shares (as quoted on the exchange on which the Class A Shares are then listed) on the Effective Date, and the adjustment to the Gross Asset Value of the other assets held by the Company on the Effective Date pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of Gross Asset Value shall be derived by reference to the Gross Asset Value of such assets. If a Transfer of Units is made in accordance with this Agreement (including a deemed Transfer for U.S. federal income tax purposes as described in Section 3.6(a)(iv)), the Capital Account of the Transferor that is attributable to the Transferred Units shall carry over to the Transferee Member in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(l).

 (a) Redemption Right.   


  


(i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 3.6, each of the Members (other than the members that are part of the PubCo Holdings Group) (each such Member, a “Redeeming Member”) shall be entitled to cause the Company to redeem all or a portion of such Member’s Units (together with the surrender and delivery of the same number of Class B Shares) for an equivalent number of Class A Shares (a “Redemption”) or, at the Company’s election made in accordance with Section 3.6(a)(iii), cash equal to the Cash Election Amount calculated with respect to such Redemption (referred to herein as the “Redemption Right”). Absent the prior written consent of the Managing Member, with respect to each Redemption, a Redeeming Member shall be (A) required to redeem at least a number of Units equal to the lesser of [•]1 Units (as adjusted for any Unit splits, combinations, subdivisions, reclassifications or similar actions or events) and all of the Units then held by such Redeeming Member and (B) permitted to effect a Redemption of Units no more frequently than once per calendar quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section 3.6(j), a Redeeming Member may exercise its Redemption Right (x) with respect to at least [•]2 Units (as adjusted for any Unit splits, combinations, subdivisions, reclassifications or similar actions or events) at any time and (y) with respect to any of the then-held Units of such Member if such Redemption Right is exercised in connection with a valid exercise of such Member’s rights to have the Class A Shares issuable in connection with such Redemption to participate in an offering of securities pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement; provided, that in the event the Managing Member consents to allow a Redemption of a lesser amount, the Liberty   1 Note to Draft: To be a number of Units equal to 0.5% of the total outstanding Units. 2 Note to Draft: To be a number of Units equal to 1% of the total outstanding Units.   30








________________


Member shall also be allowed to initiate a Redemption in an amount equal to or greater than such lesser amount. Upon theRedemption of all of a Member’s Units, such Member shall, for the avoidance of doubt, cease to be a Member of the Company.   


  (ii) In order to exercise the Redemption Right under Section 3.6(a)(i), the Redeeming Member shall provide written notice (the “Redemption Notice”) to the Company, with a copy to PubCo (the date of delivery of such Redemption Notice, the “Redemption Notice Date”), stating:   


 (A) the number of Units the Redeeming Member elects to have the Company redeem (the “Redeemed Units”);   


 (B) if the Class A Shares to be received are to be issued other than in the name of the Redeeming Member, the name(s) of thePerson(s) in whose name or on whose order the Class A Shares are to be issued;   


  


(C) whether the exercise of the Redemption Right is to be contingent (including as to timing) upon the closing of a Public Offering of the Class A Shares for which the Units will be redeemed or the closing of an announced merger, consolidation or other transaction or event to which PubCo is a party in which the Class A Shares would be exchanged or converted or become exchangeable for or convertible into cash or other securities or property; and   


  (D) if the Redeeming Member requires the Redemption to take place on a specific Business Day, such Business Day, provided that any such specified Business Day shall not be earlier than the date that would otherwise apply pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of Redemption Date. 


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) other than a Redemption, PT Isla shall not be entitled to Transfer any Units or Class B Shares (or Class A Shares delivered upon the exercise of PT Isla’s Redemption Right) prior to the six-month anniversary of the Effective Date and (ii) Isla Aggregator shall not be entitled to Transfer any Units or Class B Shares (or Class A Shares delivered upon the exercise of Isla Aggregator’s Redemption Right) prior to (A) with respect to any portion of such Units, Class B Shares and Class A Shares attributable to the indirect ownership of the KKR Balance Sheet Holders, the twelve-month anniversary of the Effective Date and (B) with respect all other Units, Class B Shares and Class A Shares held by Isla Aggregator, the six-month anniversary of the Effective Date (as applicable with respect to any Person, the “Lock-Up Period”). The Members acknowledge and agree that, during the Lock-Up Period, this provision shall expressly survive to the extent any Member ceases to be such and shall be enforceable against such former Member in all respects. Any waiver or amendment of this paragraph shall require the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors (as defined in the PubCo Certificate of Incorporation).   31








________________


If the Redeemed Units (or the Class B Shares to be transferred and surrendered) are represented by a certificate or certificates, prior to the Redemption Date, the Redeeming Member shall also present and surrender such certificate or certificates representing such Units (or Class B Shares) during normal business hours at the principal executive offices of the Company, or if any agent for the registration or transfer of Class A Shares is then duly appointed and acting (the “Transfer Agent”), at the office of the Transfer Agent. If required by the Managing Member, any certificate for Units and any certificate for Class B Shares (in each case, if certificated) surrendered to the Company hereunder shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in forms reasonably satisfactory to the Managing Member and the Transfer Agent, duly executed by the Redeeming Member or the Redeeming Member’s duly authorized representative.   


  


(iii) Upon receipt of a Redemption Notice, the Company shall be entitled to elect to settle the Redemption by delivering to the Redeeming Member, in lieu of the applicable number of Class A Shares that would be received in such Redemption, an amount of cash equal to the Cash Election Amount for such Redemption. In order to make a Cash Election with respect to a Redemption, the Company must provide written notice of such election to the Redeeming Member (with a copy to PubCo) prior to 1:00 p.m., Houston time, on or prior to the third Business Day after the Redemption Notice Date. If the Company fails to provide such written notice prior to such time, it shall not be entitled to make a Cash Election with respect to such Redemption.   


  


(iv) For U.S. federal income (and applicable state and local) tax purposes, each of the Redeeming Member, the Company, and PubCo (and any other member of the PubCo Holdings Group, as applicable), agrees to treat (A) each Redemption, to the extent that PubCo or another member of the PubCo Holdings Group contributes to the Company the consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.6(b)(ii), and (B) in the event PubCo or another member of the PubCo Holdings Group exercises its Call Right, each transaction between the Redeeming Member and PubCo or such other member of the PubCo Holdings Group, as a sale of such Redeeming Member’s Units (together with the same number of Class B Shares) to PubCo or such other member of the PubCo Holdings Group in exchange for Class A Shares or cash, as applicable. For U.S. federal income (and applicable state and local) tax purposes, each of the Redeeming Member, the Company, and PubCo (and any other member of the PubCo Holdings Group, as applicable), agrees to treat each Redemption, to the extent PubCo or another member of the PubCo Holdings Group does not contribute to the Company the consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive under Section 3.6(a)(i) and does not exercise its Call Right, as a distribution by the Company to the Redeeming Member.   32








________________






(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of concurrent or substantially concurrent Redemptions by the Liberty Member, on the one hand, and any KKR Member, on the other hand, if the Company or PubCo exercises its Cash Election with respect to such Redemptions by either Member, it shall exercise its Cash Election with respect to such Redemptions by the other Member.   


 (b) Redemption Mechanics.   


  


(i) Subject to the satisfaction of any contingency described in Section 3.6(a)(ii)(C) that is specified in the relevant Redemption Notice, the Redemption shall be completed on the Redemption Date; provided, that if a valid Cash Election has not been made, the Redeeming Member may, at any time prior to the Redemption Date, revoke its Redemption Notice by giving written notice (the “Retraction Notice”) to the Company (with a copy to PubCo); provided, however, that in no event may the Redeeming Member deliver more than one Retraction Notice in any calendar quarter. The timely delivery of a Retraction Notice shall terminate all of the Redeeming Member’s, the Company’s and PubCo’s (and, as applicable, any other member of the PubCo Holdings Group’s) rights and obligations arising from the retracted Redemption Notice.   


  


(ii) Unless the Redeeming Member has timely delivered a Retraction Notice as provided in Section 3.6(b)(i) or PubCo (or such designated member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group) has elected its Call Right pursuant to Section 3.6(f), on the Redemption Date (to be effective immediately prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date) (A) the Redeeming Member shall transfer and surrender the Redeemed Units (and a corresponding number of Class B Shares) to the Company, in each case free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (B) unless, in the event of a Cash Election by the Company, the Company in its discretion elects to fund any part of the consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive under Section 3.6(a)(i) without a contribution from PubCo or another member of the PubCo Holdings Group, PubCo (or such other member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group designated by PubCo) shall contribute to the Company the consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive under Section 3.6(a)(i) and, as described in Section 3.1(e), the Company shall issue to PubCo (or such designated member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group) a number of Units or other Equity Securities of the Company as consideration for such contribution, (C) the Company shall (x) cancel the Redeemed Units, (y) transfer to the Redeeming Member the consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive under Section 3.6(a)(i), and (z) if the Redeemed Units are certificated, issue to the Redeeming Member a certificate for a number of Units equal to the difference (if any) between the   33








________________






number of Units evidenced by the certificate surrendered by the Redeeming Member pursuant to clause (ii)(A) of this Section 3.6(b) and the number of Redeemed Units, and (D) PubCo shall cancel the surrendered Class B Shares. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company makes a valid Cash Election, the PubCo Holdings Group shall only be obligated to contribute to the Company an amount in cash equal to the net proceeds (after deduction of any Discount) from the sale by PubCo of a number of Class A Shares equal to the number of Redeemed Units to be redeemed with such cash or from the sale of other PubCo Equity Securities used to fund the Cash Election Amount.   


  


(c) If (i) there is any reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, including pursuant to a merger or consolidation, pursuant to which the Class A Shares are converted or changed into another security, securities or other property (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination or any transaction subject to Section 3.1(h)), or (ii) except in connection with actions taken with respect to the capitalization of PubCo or the Company pursuant to Section 3.1(j), PubCo, by dividend or otherwise, distributes to all holders of the Class A Shares evidences of its Indebtedness or assets, including securities (including Class A Shares and any rights, options or warrants to all holders of the Class A Shares to subscribe for or to purchase or to otherwise acquire Class A Shares, or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for Class A Shares) but excluding (A) any cash dividend or distribution, or (B) any such distribution of Indebtedness or assets, in either case (A) or (B) received by PubCo from the Company in respect of the Units, then upon any subsequent Redemption, in addition to the Class A Shares or the Cash Election Amount, as applicable, each Member shall be entitled to receive the amount of such security, securities or other property that such Member would have received if such Redemption had occurred immediately prior to the effective date of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, other similar transaction, dividend or other distribution, taking into account any adjustment as a result of any subdivision (by any split, distribution or dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of such security, securities or other property that occurs after the effective time of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is any reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the Class A Shares are converted or changed into another security, securities or other property, or any dividend or distribution (other than an excluded dividend or distribution, as described above), this Section 3.6 shall continue to be applicable, mutatis mutandis, with respect to such security or other property.   34








________________






(d) PubCo shall at all times keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares, solely for the purpose of issuance upon a Redemption, such number of Class A Shares that shall be issuable upon the Redemption of all outstanding Units (other than those Units held by any member of the PubCo Holdings Group). PubCo covenants that all Class A Shares that shall be issued upon a Redemption shall, upon issuance thereof, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (except as such non-assessability may be limited by Sections 18-607 and 18-804 of the Act). In addition, for so long as the Class A Shares are listed on a National Securities Exchange, PubCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all Class A Shares issued upon a Redemption to be listed on such National Securities Exchange at the time of such issuance.   


  


(e) The issuance of Class A Shares upon a Redemption shall be made without charge to the Redeeming Member for any stamp or other similar tax in respect of such issuance; provided, however, that if any such Class A Shares are to be issued in a name other than that of the Redeeming Member, then the Person or Persons in whose name the shares are to be issued shall pay to PubCo (or such designated member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group) the amount of any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in such issuance or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of PubCo that such tax has been paid or is not payable. Each of the Company and any member of the PubCo Holdings Group shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable upon a Redemption (and the Redeeming Member agrees to indemnify the Company and the PubCo Holdings Group with respect to) such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of applicable Law, and to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding may be taken in Class A Shares. Prior to making such deduction or withholding, the Company shall give written notice to the Redeeming Member and reasonably cooperate with such Redeeming Member to reduce or avoid any such withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant governmental authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Redeeming Member, and, if withholding is taken in Class A Shares, the relevant withholding party shall be treated as having sold such Class A Shares on behalf of such Redeeming Member for an amount of cash equal to the Fair Market Value thereof at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Governmental Entity.   


 (f) Call Right.   


  


(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.6, a Redeeming Member shall be deemed to have offered to sell its Redeemed Units to each member of the PubCo Holdings Group, and PubCo (or such other member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group designated by PubCo) may, in its sole discretion, by means of delivery of a Call Election Notice in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, this Section 3.6(f), elect to purchase directly and acquire such Units (together with the surrender and delivery of the same number of Class B Shares) on the Redemption Date by paying to the Redeeming Member (or, on the Redeeming Member’s written order, its designee) that number of Class A Shares the Redeeming Member (or its designee) would otherwise receive pursuant to Section 3.6(a)(i) or, at the   35








________________






election of PubCo (or such designated member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group), an amount of cash equal to the Cash Election Amount of such Class A Shares (the “Call Right”), whereupon PubCo (or such designated member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group) shall acquire the Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming Member (together with the surrender and delivery of the same number of Class B Shares to PubCo for cancellation). PubCo (or such designated member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of such Units; provided, that if the Cash Election Amount is funded other than through the issuance of Class A Shares, such Units will be reclassified into another Equity Security of the Company if the Managing Member determines such reclassification is necessary.   


  


(ii) PubCo (or such designated member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group) may, at any time prior to the Redemption Date, in its sole discretion, deliver a written notice (a “Call Election Notice”) to the Company and the Redeeming Member setting forth its election to exercise its Call Right. A Call Election Notice may be revoked by the applicable member of the PubCo Holdings Group at any time; provided that any such revocation does not prejudice the ability of the parties to consummate a Redemption on the Redemption Date. Except as otherwise provided by this Section 3.6(f), an exercise of the Call Right shall be consummated pursuant to the same timeframe and in the same manner as the relevant Redemption would have been consummated if a member of the PubCo Holdings Group had not delivered a Call Election Notice.   


  


(g) In the event that (i) the Members (other than members of the PubCo Holdings Group) beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 5% of the then outstanding Units and (ii) the Class A Shares are listed or admitted to trading on a National Securities Exchange, PubCo (or such other member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group designated by PubCo) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require all Members (other than members of the PubCo Holdings Group) to effect a Redemption of all, but not less than all, of the Units held by all of the Members (together with the surrender and delivery of the same number of Class B Shares); provided that a Cash Election shall not be permitted pursuant to such a Redemption under this Section 3.6(g). PubCo (or such other member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group designated by PubCo) shall deliver written notice to the Company and all of the Members (other than members of the PubCo Holdings Group) of its intention to exercise its Redemption Right pursuant to this Section 3.6(g) (a “Minority Member Redemption Notice”) at least five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed date upon which such Redemption is to be effected (such proposed date, the “Minority Member Redemption Date”), indicating in such notice the number of Units (and corresponding Class B Shares) held by such Member that PubCo (or such other member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group designated by PubCo) intends to require to be subject to such Redemption. Any Redemption pursuant to this Section 3.6(g) shall be effective on the Minority Member Redemption Date. From and after the Minority Member Redemption Date, (i) the Units and Class B Shares   36








________________






subject to such Redemption shall be deemed to be transferred to PubCo (or such other member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group designated by PubCo) on the Minority Member Redemption Date and (ii) such Member shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Units and Class B Shares subject to such Redemption (other than the right to receive Class A Shares pursuant to such Redemption). Following delivery of a Minority Member Redemption Notice and on or prior to the Minority Member Redemption Date, the Members shall take all actions reasonably requested by PubCo (or such other member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group designated by PubCo) of all of the Members to effect such Redemption, including taking any action and delivering any document required pursuant to the remainder of this Section 3.6 to effect a Redemption.   


  


(h) No Redemption shall impair the right of the Redeeming Member to receive any distributions payable on the Redeemed Units pursuant to such Redemption in respect of a record date that occurs prior to the Redemption Date for such Redemption. For the avoidance of doubt, no Redeeming Member, or a Person designated by a Redeeming Member to receive Class A Shares, shall be entitled to receive, with respect to such record date, distributions or dividends both on Redeemed Units by the Company from such Redeeming Member and on Class A Shares received by such Redeeming Member, or other Person so designated, if applicable, in such Redemption.   


  


(i) Any Units acquired by the Company under this Section 3.6 and transferred by the Company to any member of the PubCo Holdings Group shall remain outstanding and shall not be cancelled as a result of their acquisition by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the applicable member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group shall be automatically admitted as a Member of the Company with respect to any Units or other Equity Securities in the Company it receives under this Agreement (including under this Section 3.6 in connection with any Redemption).   


  


(j) The Managing Member may impose additional limitations and restrictions on Redemptions (including limiting Redemptions or creating priority procedures for Redemptions), to the extent it determines in Good Faith such limitations and restrictions to be necessary or appropriate to avoid undue risk that the Company may be classified as a “publicly traded partnership” within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code. Furthermore, the Managing Member may require any Member (or group of Members) to redeem all of its (or their) Units pursuant to the Redemption Right to the extent it determines in Good Faith that such Redemption is necessary or appropriate to avoid undue risk that the Company may be classified as a “publicly traded partnership” within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code. Upon delivery of any notice by the Managing Member to such Member (or group of Members) requiring such Redemption, such Member (or group of Members) shall exchange, subject to exercise by PubCo (or such other member(s) of the PubCo Holdings Group designated by PubCo) of the Call Right pursuant to Section 3.6(f)(i), all of its (or their) Units effective as of the date specified in such notice (and such date shall be deemed to be a Redemption Date for purposes of this Agreement) in accordance with this Section 3.6 and otherwise in accordance with the requirements set forth in such notice.   37

ARTICLE IV 


ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES 


Section 4.1 Profits and Losses. After giving effect to the allocations under Section 4.2 and subject to Section 4.5, Profits and Losses (and, to the extent determined by the Managing Member to be necessary and appropriate to achieve the resulting Capital Account balances described below, any allocable items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit includable in the computation of Profits and Losses) for each Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall be allocated among the Members during such Fiscal Year or other taxable period in a manner such that, after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 4.2 and all distributions through the end of such Fiscal Year or other taxable period, the Capital Account balance of each Member, immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal to (i) the amount such Member would receive pursuant to Section 10.3(b) if all assets of the Company on hand at the end of such Fiscal Year or other taxable period were sold for cash equal to their Gross Asset Values, all liabilities of the Company were satisfied in cash in accordance with their terms (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Gross Asset Value of the assets securing such liability), and all remaining or resulting cash was distributed, in accordance with Section 10.3(b), to the Members immediately after making such allocation, minus (ii) such Member’s share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Minimum Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets, and the amount any such Member is treated as obligated to contribute to the Company, computed immediately after the hypothetical sale of assets. 


Section 4.2 Special Allocations. The following allocations shall be made in the following order:   


  


(a) Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall be specially allocated to the Members on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member as of the last day of such Fiscal Year or other taxable period. The amount of Nonrecourse Deductions for a Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall equal the excess, if any, of the net increase, if any, in the amount of Company Minimum Gain during that Fiscal Year or other taxable period over the aggregate amount of any distributions during that Fiscal Year or other taxable period of proceeds of a Nonrecourse Liability that are allocable to an increase in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(d).   


  


(b) Any Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall be specially allocated to the Member who bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Member bears the Economic Risk of Loss for such Member Nonrecourse Debt, the Member Nonrecourse Deductions attributable   38








________________


 to such Member Nonrecourse Debt shall be allocated among the Members according to the ratio in which they bear the Economic Risk of Loss. This Section 4.2(b) is intended to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.   


  


(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain for a prior Fiscal Year or other taxable period and the Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior periods to allocate among the Members under this Section 4.2(c)), each Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such Fiscal Year or other taxable period in an amount equal to such Member’s share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during such year (as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2)). This Section 4.2(c) is intended to constitute a minimum gain chargeback under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.   


  


(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except Section 4.2(c), if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain for a prior Fiscal Year or other taxable period and the Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior periods to allocate among the Members under this Section 4.2(d)), each Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain in an amount equal to such Member’s share of the net decrease in Member Minimum Gain (as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4)). This Section 4.2(d) is intended to constitute a partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.   


  


(e) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except Section 4.2(a) and Section 4.2(b), no Losses or other items of loss or expense shall be allocated to any Member to the extent that such allocation would cause such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) at the end of such Fiscal Year or other taxable period. All Losses and other items of loss and expense in excess of the limitation set forth in this Section 4.2(e) shall be allocated to the Members who do not have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in proportion to their relative positive Capital Accounts but only to the extent that such Losses and other items of loss and expense do not cause any such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.   


  


(f) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except Section 4.2(c) and Section 4.2(d), if any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustment, allocation or distribution described in paragraph (4), (5) or (6) of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), items of income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of income, including gross income, and gain for the Fiscal Year or other taxable period) shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate any Adjusted Capital Account Deficit   39

of that Member as quickly as possible; provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 4.2(f) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Article IV have been tentatively made as if this Section 4.2(f) were not in this Agreement. This Section 4.2(f) is intended to constitute a qualified income offset under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.   


  


(g) If any Member has a deficit balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Fiscal Year or other taxable period that is in excess of the sum of (i) the amount that such Member is obligated to restore and (ii) the amount that the Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), that Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain and Simulated Gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 4.2(g) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this Article IV have been made as if Section 4.2(f) and this Section 4.2(g) were not in this Agreement.   


  


(h) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset pursuant to Sections 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as a result of a distribution to any Member in complete liquidation of such Member’s interest in the Company, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such item of gain or loss shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) if such section applies or to the Member to whom such distribution was made if Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies.   


 (i) Simulated Depletion for each Depletable Property, and Simulated Loss for Depletable Property upon the disposition of such DepletableProperty, shall be allocated among the Members in proportion to their shares of Simulated Basis in such Depletable Property.   


  


(j) The allocations set forth in Section 4.2(a) through Section 4.2(h) (the “Regulatory Allocations”) are intended to comply with certain requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IV (other than the Regulatory Allocations), the Regulatory Allocations (and anticipated future Regulatory Allocations) shall be taken into account in allocating other items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Members so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such allocation of other items and the Regulatory Allocations to each Member should be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred. This Section 4.2(j) is intended to minimize to the extent possible and to the extent necessary any economic distortions which may result from application of the Regulatory Allocations and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.   40

(k) Items of income, gain, loss, expense or credit resulting from a Covered Audit Adjustment shall be allocated to the Members in accordancewith the applicable provisions of the Partnership Tax Audit Rules, as determined in Good Faith by the Managing Member. 


Section 4.3 Allocations for Tax Purposes in General.   


  (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.3 or Section 4.4, each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as such item is allocated under Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.   


  


(b) In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including the Treasury Regulations applying the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code to changes in Gross Asset Values), items of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any Company property having a Gross Asset Value that differs from such property’s Adjusted Basis shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be allocated among the Members to account for any such difference using such method or methods as determined by the Managing Member to be appropriate and in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations; provided, that, in making such determination with respect to the properties contributed in the Transactions and adjustments occurring as a result of the Transactions, the Managing Member intends to use reasonable best efforts to minimize the U.S. federal cash tax obligations of the PubCo Holdings Group in a manner that is not materially different for the Liberty Member as compared to the KKR Member; provided further, with respect to any difference between the Gross Asset Value and the Adjusted Basis of the properties treated as contributed pursuant to the Contribution Agreement to the Company (as the continuation of Isla for U.S. federal income tax purposes) on the date of such contribution and for which the “remedial method” under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(d) has been elected, (i) the “remedial method” shall be applied and (ii) to the extent that any such properties include partnership interests, the “remedial method” looking through to the underlying properties in the contributed partnership interests shall be applied.   


  (c) Any (i) recapture of depreciation or any other item of deduction shall be allocated, in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1245-1(e) and 1.1254-5, to the Members who received the benefit of such deductions to the maximum extent permissible by Law, and (ii) recapture of grants or credits shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with applicable Law.   


 (d) Tax credits of the Company shall be allocated among the Members as provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii) and1.704-1(b)(4)(viii).   41








________________


 (e) Allocations pursuant to this Section 4.3 are solely for purposes of U.S. federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect or in any way be taken into account in computing any Member’s Capital Account or share of Profits, Losses, other items or distributions pursuant to any provision of this Agreement   


  (f) If, as a result of an exercise of a noncompensatory option to acquire an interest in the Company, a Capital Account reallocation is required under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the Company shall make corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x). 


Section 4.4 Income Tax Allocations with Respect to Depletable Properties.   


  


(a) Cost and percentage depletion deductions with respect to any Depletable Property shall be computed separately by the Members rather than the Company. For purposes of such computations, the U.S. federal income tax basis of each Depletable Property shall be allocated to each Member pro rata, in accordance with the number of Units owned by such Member as of the time such Depletable Property is acquired by the Company (and any additions to such U.S. federal income tax basis resulting from expenditures required to be capitalized in such basis shall be allocated among the Members in a manner designed to cause the Members’ proportionate shares of such adjusted U.S. federal income tax basis to be in accordance with their proportionate ownership of Units as determined at the time of any such additions), and shall be reallocated among the Members pro rata, in accordance with the number of Units owned by such Member as determined immediately following the occurrence of an event giving rise to an adjustment to the Gross Asset Values of the Company’s Depletable Properties pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of Gross Asset Value. The Company shall inform each Member of such Member’s allocable share of the U.S. federal income tax basis of each Depletable Property promptly following the acquisition of such Depletable Property by the Company, any adjustment resulting from expenditures required to be capitalized in such basis, and any reallocation of such basis as provided in the previous sentence.   


  


(b) For purposes of the separate computation of gain or loss by each Member on the taxable disposition of Depletable Property, the amount realized from such disposition shall be allocated (i) first, to the Members in an amount equal to the Simulated Basis in such Depletable Property in proportion to their allocable shares thereof and (ii) second, any remaining amount realized shall be allocated consistent with the allocation of Simulated Gains.   


  


(c) The allocations described in this Section 4.4 are intended to be applied in accordance with the Members’ “interests in partnership capital” under Section 613A(c)(7)(D) of the Code; provided that the Members understand and agree that the Managing Member may authorize special allocations of U.S. federal income tax basis, income, gain, deduction or loss, as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in order to eliminate differences between Simulated Basis and adjusted U.S. federal income tax basis with respect to Depletable Properties, in such   42








________________


 manner as determined consistent with the principles outlined in Section 4.3(b). The provisions of this Section 4.4(c) and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to allocations under Code Section 613A(c)(7)(D) are intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(v) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations.   


  


(d) Each Member, with the assistance of the Company, shall separately keep records of its share of the adjusted tax basis in each Depletable Property, adjust such share of the adjusted tax basis for any cost or percentage depletion allowable with respect to such property and use such adjusted tax basis in the computation of its cost depletion or in the computation of its gain or loss on the disposition of such property by the Company. To assist the Members and their direct and indirect owners in computing their depletion allowances and maintaining the information required pursuant to this Section 4.4(d), the Company shall provide any and all information, including well-specific information to the extent such information is available to the Company, upon the reasonable request of a Member. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, each Member shall advise the Company of its adjusted tax basis in each Depletable Property and any depletion computed with respect thereto, both as computed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection for purposes of allowing the Company to make adjustments to the tax basis of its assets as a result of certain transfers of interests in the Company or distributions by the Company. The Company may rely on such information and, if it is not provided by the Member, may make such reasonable assumptions as it shall determine with respect thereto. When reasonably requested by a Member, the Company shall provide all available information needed by such Member to comply with the record keeping requirements of this Section 4.4(d) and other applicable tax reporting obligations. 


Section 4.5 Other Allocation Rules.   


  (a) The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the allocations made by this Article IV and the economic impact of the allocations on the amounts receivable by them under this Agreement. The Members hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of this Article IV in reporting their share of Company income and loss for income tax purposes.   


  


(b) The provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance for each Member of a Capital Account as provided by Section 3.4 and the allocations set forth in Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3, and Section 4.4 are intended to comply with the Treasury Regulations and to reflect the intended economic entitlement of the Members. If the Managing Member determines in Good Faith that the application of the provisions in Section 3.4, Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3, or Section 4.4 would result in non-compliance with the Treasury Regulations or would be inconsistent with the intended economic entitlement of the Members, the Managing Member is authorized to make any appropriate adjustments to such provisions.   43








________________


 (c) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit allocable to an interest in the Company that is Transferred shall be allocated between the Transferor and the Transferee in accordance with a method reasonably determined by the Managing Member and permissible under Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.   


  (d) The Members’ proportionate shares of the “excess nonrecourse liabilities” of the Company, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), shall be allocated to the Members on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member unless otherwise determined in Good Faith by the Managing Member.

DISTRIBUTIONS 


Section 5.1 Distributions.   


  


(a) Distributions. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and hereunder, and except as otherwise provided in Section 10.3, distributions to Members may be declared by the Managing Member out of funds legally available therefor in such amounts and on such terms (including the payment dates of such distributions) as the Managing Member shall determine using such record date as the Managing Member may designate; any such distribution shall be made to the Members as of the close of business on such record date on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member as of the close of business on such record date (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, repurchases or redemptions made in accordance with Section 3.1(f), Section 3.6, or payments made in accordance with Section 6.2 or Section 6.7 need not be on a pro rata basis); provided, however, that the Managing Member shall have the obligation to make distributions as set forth in Section 5.2 and Section 10.3(b)(iii); and provided further, that, notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no distributions shall be made to any Member to the extent such distribution would render the Company insolvent or violate the Act. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, insolvency means the inability of the Company to meet its payment obligations when due. Promptly following the designation of a record date and the declaration of a distribution pursuant to this Section 5.1, the Managing Member shall give notice to each Member of the record date, the amount and the terms of the distribution and the payment date thereof.   


  


(b) Distribution Policy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.1, subject to applicable Law, the Managing Member shall cause the Company, within 90 days following the end of each calendar quarter, to make distributions of Available Cash to the Members in accordance with this Agreement in an aggregate amount (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account all distributions by the Company to the Members in respect of such period, including in respect of the Management Services Agreement and pursuant to Section 5.2) equal to at least (i) if   44








________________






the Leverage Ratio as of the date of such distribution is below the Target Leverage Ratio, 10% of Consolidated EBITDAX in respect of such calendar quarter and (ii) if the Leverage Ratio as of the date of such distribution is at or above the Target Leverage Ratio, 5% of Consolidated EBITDAX in respect of such calendar quarter; provided, that the Company shall not be obligated to make any distributions pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) in excess of Available Cash as of such time.   


 (c) Successors. For purposes of determining the amount of distributions, each Member shall be treated as having made the CapitalContributions and as having received the distributions made to or received by its predecessors in respect of any of such Member’s Units.   


  


(d) Distributions In-Kind. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any distributions may be made in cash or in kind, or partly in cash and partly in kind, as determined by the Managing Member. To the extent that the Company distributes property in-kind to the Members, the Company shall be treated as making a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of such property for purposes of Section 5.1(a) and such property shall be treated as if it were sold for an amount equal to its Fair Market Value. Any resulting gain or loss shall be allocated to the Member’s Capital Accounts in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. 


Section 5.2 Tax-Related Distributions. The Company shall, subject to any restrictions contained in any agreement to which the Company is bound, including an Indebtedness Agreement, make distributions out of legally available funds to all Members on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member, at such times and in such amounts as the Managing Member reasonably determines is necessary (taking into account any distributions reasonably expected to be made pursuant to Section 5.1(a) (including as a result of the application of Section 5.1(b)), but only to the extent reasonably contemporaneously with such tax-related distribution), to enable the PubCo Holdings Group to timely satisfy any and all U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax obligations (including any Company Level Taxes payable by the PubCo Holdings Group as a result of an election under Section 6226(a) of the Code or otherwise, but excluding any obligations to remit any withholdings withheld from payments to third parties) owed by the PubCo Holdings Group, in the aggregate. 


Section 5.3 Distribution Upon Withdrawal. No withdrawing Member shall be entitled to receive any distribution or the value of such Member’s Interest in the Company as a result of withdrawal from the Company prior to the liquidation of the Company, except as specifically provided in this Agreement.   45

Except as otherwise required by Law or expressly provided for in this Agreement, (i) the Managing Member shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Company, (ii) the management and control of the Company’s business activities and operations shall rest exclusively with the Managing Member, and the Managing Member shall make all decisions regarding the business, activities and operations of the Company (including the incurrence of costs and expenses) in the sole discretion without the consent of any other Member, and (iii) the Members other than the Managing Member (in their capacity as such) shall not participate in the control, management, direction or operation of the activities or affairs of the Company and shall have no power to act for or bind the Company.   


  


(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, in connection with the performance of its duties as the Managing Member of the Company, the Managing Member acknowledges that it will owe to the Members the same fiduciary duties as it would owe to the stockholders of a Delaware corporation under the DGCL if it were a member of the board of directors of such a corporation and the Members were stockholders of such corporation. The Members further acknowledge that the Managing Member will take action through its board of directors, and that the members of the Managing Member’s board of directors will owe comparable fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Managing Member. 


Section 6.2 Indemnification; Exculpation.   


  


(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended (provided, that no such amendment shall limit a Covered Person’s rights to indemnification hereunder with respect to any actions or events occurring prior to such amendment), any person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”) by reason of the fact that such person (or a person for whom such person is the legal representative or a director, officer or employee) is or was a person entitled to indemnification under the Existing LLC Agreement, or is a Member, or acting as the Managing Member or Company Representative of the Company or, while being a person entitled to indemnification under the Existing LLC Agreement, a Member, or acting as the Managing Member or Company Representative of the Company, is or was serving at the request of the Company as a member, director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of another limited liability company or of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (each of the persons referred to above in this Section 6.2(a) being referred to as a “Covered Person”), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action or failure or omission of action in an official capacity as a member, director, officer, trustee, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a member, director, officer, trustee, employee or agent, against all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), liability and loss incurred or suffered by such Covered Person in connection with such Proceeding, unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that,   46








________________






in respect of such act or omission, and taking into account the acknowledgements and agreements set forth in this Agreement, such Covered Person engaged in bad faith, fraud or willful misconduct. The Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable Law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended (provided, that no such amendment shall limit a Covered Person’s rights to indemnification hereunder with respect to any actions or events occurring prior to such amendment), pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that to the extent required by applicable Law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.2(a) or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this Section 6.2(a) shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a member, director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2(a), except for Proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Company shall indemnify and advance expenses to a Covered Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Covered Person only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Managing Member. If this Section 6.2(a) or any portion of this Section 6.2(a) shall be invalidated on any ground by a court of competent jurisdiction the Company shall nevertheless indemnify each Covered Person as to expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including a grand jury proceeding or action or suit brought by or in the right of the Company, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Section 6.2(a) that shall not have been invalidated.   


  


(b) Notwithstanding that a Covered Person may have certain rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses provided by other persons (collectively, the “Other Indemnitors”), with respect to the rights to an advancement of expenses or indemnification set forth herein, the Company: (i) shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to such indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such indemnitee are secondary); and (ii) shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by such indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all liabilities, without regard to any rights such indemnitee may have against any of the Other Indemnitors. No advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an indemnitee with respect to any proceeding for which such indemnitee has sought an advancement of expenses or indemnification from the Company shall affect the immediately preceding sentence, and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such indemnitee against the Company.   47








________________






(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 6.2(c) shall be in addition to any other rights to which a Covered Person may be entitled under any agreement, insurance, pursuant to any vote of the Members entitled to vote on such matter, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both as to actions in the Covered Person’s capacity with respect to the Company and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to serve in such capacity. This Section 6.2(c) shall not limit the right of the Company, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to, and purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of, Persons other than Covered Persons.   


  


(d) Subject to other applicable provisions of this Section 6.2, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Covered Persons shall not be liable to the Company, any Subsidiary, any director, any Member or any holder of any equity interest in any Subsidiary by virtue of being a Covered Person or for any acts or omissions in their capacity as a Covered Person or otherwise in connection with the Company, this Agreement or the business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that such losses or liabilities were the result of conduct in which such Covered Person engaged in bad faith, fraud or willful misconduct.   


 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.2, the Company shall have no obligation to indemnify a Covered Person forsuch Covered Person’s share of Taxes imposed as a result of the Managing Member’s election under Section 9.2(a)(iv). 


Section 6.3 Maintenance of Insurance or Other Financial Arrangements. In compliance with applicable Law, the Company (with the approval of the Managing Member) may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any Person who is or was a Member, employee or agent of the Company, or at the request of the Company is or was serving as a manager, director, officer, employee or agent of another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for any Liability asserted against such Person and Liability and expenses incurred by such Person in such Person’s capacity as such, or arising out of such Person’s status as such, whether or not the Company has the authority to indemnify such Person against such Liability and expenses. 


Section 6.4 Resignation or Termination of Managing Member. PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) shall not, by any means, resign as, cease to be or be replaced as Managing Member except in compliance with this Section 6.4. No termination or replacement of PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) as Managing Member shall be effective unless proper provision is made, in compliance with this Agreement, so that the obligations of PubCo, its successor (if applicable) and any new Managing Member and the rights of all Members under this Agreement and applicable Law remain in full force and effect. No appointment of a Person other than PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) as Managing Member shall be effective unless PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) and the new Managing Member (as applicable) provide all other Members with contractual rights, directly enforceable by such other Members against PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) and the new Managing Member (as applicable), to cause (a) PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) to comply with all of PubCo’s or such member’s obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.6) other than those that must necessarily be taken in its capacity as Managing Member and (b) the new Managing Member to comply with all of the Managing Member’s obligations under this Agreement.   48

Section 6.5 No Inconsistent Obligations. The Managing Member represents that it does not have any contracts, other agreements, duties or obligations that are inconsistent with its duties and obligations (whether or not in its capacity as Managing Member) under this Agreement and covenants that, except as permitted by Section 6.1, it will not enter into any contracts or other agreements or undertake or acquire any other duties or obligations that are inconsistent with such duties and obligations. 


Section 6.6 Reclassification Events of PubCo. If a Reclassification Event occurs, the Managing Member or its successor, as the case may be, shall amend this Agreement in compliance with Section 11.1, and enter into supplementary or additional agreements, to ensure that, following the effective date of the Reclassification Event: (i) the Redemption Right of holders of Units set forth in Section 3.6 provide that each Unit (together with the surrender and delivery of one Class B Share) that remains outstanding immediately following such Reclassification Event is redeemable for the same amount and same type of property, securities or cash (or combination thereof) that one Class A Share becomes exchangeable for or converted into as a result of the Reclassification Event, and (ii) PubCo or the successor to PubCo, as applicable, is obligated to deliver such property, securities or cash upon such redemption. PubCo shall not consummate or agree to consummate any Reclassification Event unless the successor Person, if any, becomes obligated to comply with the obligations of PubCo (in whatever capacity) under this Agreement, unless immediately following consummation of such Reclassification Event the Company is wholly-owned by PubCo (or its successor in such Reclassification Event) and its Affiliates. 


Section 6.7 Certain Costs and Expenses. The Company shall (i) pay, or cause to be paid, all costs, fees, operating expenses and other expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the costs, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants or other professionals and the compensation of all personnel providing services to the Company and its Subsidiaries) incurred in pursuing and conducting, or otherwise related to, the activities of the Company and (ii) in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, reimburse the Managing Member for any costs, fees or expenses incurred by it in connection with serving as the Managing Member. To the extent that the Managing Member determines in its sole discretion that such expenses are related to the business and affairs of the Managing Member that are conducted through the Company or its Subsidiaries (including expenses that relate to the business and affairs of the Company or its Subsidiaries and that also relate to other activities of the Managing Member or any other member of the PubCo Holdings Group), the Managing Member may cause the Company to pay or bear all expenses of the PubCo Holdings Group, including costs of securities offerings not borne directly by Members, board of directors compensation and meeting costs, costs of periodic reports to stockholders of PubCo, litigation costs and damages arising from litigation, accounting and legal costs, provided that the Company shall not pay or bear any income tax obligations of any member of the PubCo Holdings Group or any obligation of any member of the PubCo Holdings Group under the Management Services Agreement.   49

The Company renounces any interest or expectancy of the Company in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from time to time presented to any Business Opportunities Exempt Party. No Business Opportunities Exempt Party who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Company. No amendment or repeal of this Section 7.4 shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any Business Opportunities Exempt Party for or with respect to any opportunities of which any such Business Opportunities Exempt Party becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal. Any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any Units shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 7.4. Neither the alteration, amendment or repeal of this Section 7.4, nor the adoption of any provision of this Agreement inconsistent with this Section 7.4, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Section 7.4 in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Section 7.4, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption. 


Section 7.5 Certain Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries may not take, or agree or commit to take, any of the following actions without the approval of the Liberty Member:   51

TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS 


Section 8.1 Restrictions on Transfer.   


  


(a) Except as provided in Section 3.6, no Member shall Transfer all or any portion of its Interest without the Managing Member’s prior written consent, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the Managing Member’s sole discretion (except that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in the event of a Transfer to an Affiliate, unless such Transfer is subject to any restrictions set forth in the organizational documents of a Member); provided, that, to the extent that the Managing Member determines in Good Faith that a proposed transfer would not have any of the effects contemplated by Section 8.1(b), then the Managing Member will not withhold its consent to a Transfer by the Liberty Member to the extent the Liberty Member Transfers at least 2% of the then-outstanding Units to a single Person. If, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8.1(a), all or any portion of a Member’s Interests are Transferred in violation of this Article VIII, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, then without limiting any other rights and remedies available to the other parties under this Agreement or otherwise, the Transferee of such Interest (or portion thereof) shall not be admitted to the Company as a Member or be entitled to any rights as a Member hereunder, and the Transferor will continue to be bound by all obligations hereunder, unless and until the Managing Member consents in writing to such Transfer, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the Managing Member’s sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions on Transfer contained in this Article VIII shall not apply to the Transfer of any capital stock of PubCo; provided that in no circumstance may Class B Shares be Transferred unless a corresponding number of Units are Transferred to the same Person and in no circumstance may Units may be Transferred unless a corresponding number of Class B Shares are also Transferred to the same Person.   


  


(b) In addition to any other restrictions on Transfer herein contained, including the provisions of this Article VIII, in no event may any Transfer or assignment of Interests or Equity Securities in the Company by any Member be made (i) to any Person who lacks the legal right, power or capacity to own Interests or Equity Securities in the Company; (ii) if the Managing Member determines such Transfer (A) would be considered to be effected on or through an “established securities market” or a “secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof,” as such terms are used in Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1, (B) would result in the Company having more than one hundred (100) partners, within the meaning of   52

Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) (determined taking into account the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)), or (C) would cause the Company to be treated as a “publicly traded partnership” within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or a successor provision or otherwise become taxable as a corporation under the Code; (iii) if such Transfer would cause the Company to become, with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA, a “party-in-interest” (as defined in Section 3 (14) of ERISA) or a “disqualified person” (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code); (iv) if such Transfer would, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, cause any portion of the assets of the Company to constitute assets of any employee benefit plan pursuant to the Plan Asset Regulations or otherwise cause the Company to be subject to regulation under ERISA; (v) if such Transfer requires the registration of such Interests or Equity Securities issued upon any exchange of such Interests or Equity Securities, pursuant to any applicable U.S. federal or state securities Laws; or (vi) if such Transfer subjects the Company to regulation under the Investment Company Act or the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, each as amended (or any succeeding law). Any attempted or purported Transfer of all or a portion of a Member’s Interests in violation of this Section 8.1(b) shall be null and void and of no force or effect whatsoever.   


  


(c) A Member making a Transfer permitted by this Agreement shall (i) at least five (5) Business Days before such Transfer, deliver to the Company an affidavit of non-foreign status with respect to such Member that satisfies the requirements of Section 1446(f)(2) of the Code, or (ii) contemporaneously with the Transfer, cause the Transferee to properly withhold and remit to the Internal Revenue Service the amount of tax required to be withheld upon the Transfer by Section 1446(f) of the Code (and provide evidence to the Company of such withholding and remittance promptly thereafter). 


Section 8.2 Transferee Members. A Transferee of Interests or Equity Securities in the Company pursuant to this Article VIII shall have the right to become a Member only if (a) the requirements of this Article VIII are met, (b) such Transferee executes an instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Managing Member agreeing to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and assuming all of the Transferor’s then existing and future Liabilities arising under or relating to this Agreement, (c) such Transferee represents that the Transfer was made in accordance with all applicable securities Laws and such other reasonable representations as reasonably requested by the Managing Member, (d) the Transferor or Transferee shall have reimbursed the Company for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) of any Transfer or proposed Transfer of all or a portion of a Member’s Interest, whether or not consummated, and (d) if such Transferee or his or her spouse is a resident of a community property jurisdiction, then such Transferee’s spouse shall also execute an instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Managing Member agreeing to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement to the extent of his or her community property or quasi-community property interest, if any, in such Member’s Interest. Unless agreed to in writing by the Managing Member, the admission of a Member shall not result in the release of the Transferor from any Liability that the Transferor may have to each remaining Member or to the Company under this Agreement or any other Contract between the Managing Member, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Transferor or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand. Written notice of the admission of a Member shall be sent promptly by the Company to each remaining Member.   53

Section 8.4 Tag-Along Rights. 


(a) Except as provided in the PT Isla LLC Agreement (in connection with a transfer to a Tag Holding Company (as defined in the PT Isla LLC Agreement) thereunder), if the KKR Member (the “Tag Seller”) desires to effect a Transfer of any Units to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Tag Seller (such Transferee, the “Tag-Along Transferee,” and such Transfer, a “Tag Sale”), then at least 15 days prior to the closing of such Tag Sale, the Tag Seller shall make a written offer (the “Participation Offer”) to the Liberty Member (the “Co-Seller”), to include in the proposed Tag Sale a number of Units owned and designated by the Co-Seller in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.4. 


(b) The Participation Offer shall describe the terms and conditions of the proposed Tag Sale, including (i) the aggregate number of Units proposed to be sold by the Tag Seller, (ii) the per Unit purchase price proposed to be paid by the Tag-Along Transferee for such Units, (iii) the type of consideration to be received for each Unit proposed to be sold, (iv) the name of the Tag-Along Transferee, (v) the proposed closing date of the Tag Sale, if known, (vi) a copy of the latest draft (or execution copy if available) of the definitive documentation for such Tag Sale and (vii) the percentage of the Tag Seller’s Units the Tag Seller proposes to Transfer in such Tag Sale (the “Participation Percentage”). The Participation Offer shall be conditioned upon (A) the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Participation Offer with the Tag-Along Transferee named therein and (B) the Co-Seller’s execution and delivery of all agreements and other documents as the Tag Seller is required to execute and deliver in connection with such Tag Sale.   54








________________


(c) The Co-Seller shall have the right, exercisable by delivery of an irrevocable written notice (an “Tag Election Notice”) to the Tag Seller at any time within 10 Business Days after delivery of the Participation Offer (the “Tag Election Deadline”), to request to include in such Tag Sale a number of the Co-Seller’s Units equal to the Participation Percentage of the Co-Seller’s Units. 


(d) Promptly following the completion of the procedures described in Section 8.4(c), the Tag Seller shall notify the Tag-Along Transferee of the total number and class of Units requested to be included in the Tag Sale. If the Tag-Along Transferee is unwilling to acquire all of the Units offered to it by the Tag Seller and the Co-Seller, the Units to be included in the Tag Sale shall be allocated pro rata among the Tag Seller and the Co-Seller electing to include Units in such Tag Sale based on their respective, relative Sharing Percentages as of the date on which the applicable Participation Offer is delivered (such Units included in the Tag Sale, the “Purchased Units”). 


(e) The Purchased Units of the Co-Seller and the Tag Seller sold in any Tag Sale shall entitle the Co-Seller or the Tag Seller to receive an amount equal to (i) the number of Purchased Units sold by the Co-Seller or the Tag Seller, as applicable, multiplied by (ii) the per Unit purchase price paid by the Tag-Along Transferee for such Units. 


(f) In the event the Co-Seller delivers a Tag Election Notice by the Tag Election Deadline, the Co-Seller shall make substantially the same representations and warranties and related indemnities and covenants as the Tag Seller; provided, that no participating Member shall be required to assume or incur any liability (including by being jointly liable for a breach of a representation or warranty) in excess of the amount to be distributed or paid to such Member in connection with the Tag Sale or in excess of its pro rata share of such liability (based on the relative proceeds received, or to be received, by such Member in a Tag Sale, divided by the aggregate proceeds received, or to be received, by all participating Members in such Tag Sale), except with respect to fraud or indemnification for fundamental representations or warranties made by such Member with respect to such Member or its Affiliates and representations or warranties made by such Member with respect to its Units. If the Tag Seller is subject to any indemnification holdback in the consideration paid to it for Units sold pursuant to this Section 8.4, the Co-Seller who sells any of its Units pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.4 shall be subject to the same indemnification holdback (including by means of an escrow) in proportion to the Co-Seller’s relative share of the consideration. 


(g) In the event the Co-Seller does not deliver a Tag Election Notice to the Tag Seller by the Tag Election Deadline, then the Co-Seller shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section 8.4 with respect to such Tag Sale, and the Tag Seller shall thereafter be free to Transfer its Units that were included in the Participation Offer to the Tag-Along Transferee in the Tag Sale, for the same form of consideration set forth in the Participation Offer, and at a per Unit price no greater than the per Unit price set forth in the Participation Offer, and on other terms and conditions which are not more favorable in the aggregate to the Tag Seller than those set forth in the Participation Offer. In the event that the Tag Seller shall not have consummated the Tag Sale   55

within 90 days after delivery of the Participation Offer (subject to extension of up to 240 days after delivery of the Participation Offer if such extension is necessary to comply with any regulatory requirements (including the expiration of any applicable waiting periods); provided, that definitive documentation binding both parties to complete such Tag Sale subject to satisfaction of such regulatory requirements is executed within such 90 day period), the Tag Seller and any participating Co-Seller shall not thereafter Transfer any Units pursuant to the Tag Sale without again complying with the terms of this Section 8.4. 


(h) The Co-Seller’s Tag Election Notice shall be irrevocable, and, subject to a reduction in the number of Units to be included in the Tag Sale pursuant to Section 8.4, the Co-Seller shall be bound and obligated to Transfer in the Tag Sale the Co-Seller’s portion of the Purchased Units to the Tag-Along Transferee on the same terms and conditions, with respect to each Unit Transferred, as set forth in the Participation Offer; provided, that if the material terms of the Tag Sale adversely change, including if the price per Unit shall be less than the price per Unit set forth in the Participation Offer, the form of consideration shall be different or the other terms and conditions of the Tag Sale shall be materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Co-Seller than those set forth in the Participation Offer, the Co-Seller shall be permitted to withdraw its Tag Election Notice by written notice to the Tag Seller and upon such withdrawal shall be released from the Co-Seller’s requirement to participate in such Tag Sale. 


(i) Unless otherwise agreed by the participating Members, each participating Member will bear its own costs in connection with a Tag Sale and its pro rata share (based on the relative proceeds received, or to be received, by that Member in a Tag Sale, divided by the aggregate proceeds received, or to be received, by all participating Members in such Tag Sale) of the costs arising pursuant to such Tag Sale to the extent such costs are incurred for the benefit of all participating Members and are not otherwise paid by the Tag-Along Transferee. Costs incurred by or on behalf of a participating Member for its sole benefit will not be considered incurred for the benefit of all participating Members. 


(j) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.4, and the calculations contemplated hereby, shall apply to the Liberty Member’s aggregate ownership of Units. 


(k) No Transfer, sale or disposition of Units shall be subject to Section 8.4 if such Transfer, sale or disposition of Units is solely among members of the KKR Group; provided, that, in each case, if the Transferee is an entity, at least a majority of the ultimate direct or indirect entitlement to distributions in respect of equity interests payable in the ordinary course by such Transferee after such Transfer will be held by ultimate Persons that were entitled, directly or indirectly, to at least a majority of the distributions in respect of equity interests payable in the ordinary course by the Transferor prior to such Transfer. 


(l) Any attempted or purported Transfer of all or a portion of a Member’s Interests in violation of this Section 8.4 shall be null and void and of no force or effect whatsoever.   56

The Managing Member shall furnish to each Member a copy of each return and statement, together with any schedules (including Internal Revenue Service Schedule K-1) and any other information that a Member may require in connection with such Member’s (or its direct or indirect owner’s) own tax affairs as soon as practicable. Upon request of the Liberty Member, the Company shall provide the Liberty Member with drafts of the Company’s income, franchise and similar tax returns that are to be filed by the Company reasonably in advance of when such returns are required to be filed (taking into account any validly obtained extension) for review and comment, and the Company shall incorporate the timely-received reasonable comments of the Liberty Member. The Members agree to cooperate with the Company and such other Members to determine the assumptions, including those necessary to estimate the Company’s taxable income from its oil and gas operations for the entire Fiscal Year based on information available as of September 30th of such Fiscal Year, that will be used to estimate each Member’s share of the Company’s taxable income for such Fiscal Year.

Section 9.5 Withholding Tax Payments and Obligations.   


  


(a) Withholding Tax Payments. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries may withhold from distributions, allocations or portions thereof if it is required to do so by any applicable rule, regulation or Law, and each Member hereby authorizes the Company and its Subsidiaries to withhold or pay on behalf of or with respect to such Member, any amount of U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. taxes that the Managing Member determines, in Good Faith, that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required to withhold or pay with respect to any amount distributable or allocable to such Member pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that the Company shall provide at least 10 Business Days’ written notice to a Member if the Company intends to withhold any such taxes with respect to such Member under this Section 9.5(a), and the Company and the applicable Member to which such withholding applies shall cooperate in Good Faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable law, the amount of any such withholding, including by providing any certificates or forms that are reasonably requested to establish an exemption from (or reduction in) any such withholding.   


  


(b) Allocation of Tax Payments. To the extent that any tax is paid by (or withheld from amounts payable to) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the Managing Member determines, in Good Faith, that such tax (including any Company Level Tax) specifically relates to one or more particular Members, such tax shall be treated as an amount of tax withheld or paid with respect to such Member pursuant to this Section 9.5; provided, that the Company Representative and the Managing Member shall (i) consult with the Liberty Member when determining the portion of any Company Level Taxes that relate to the Liberty Member, taking into account the effect of any modifications under Section 6225(c) of the Code that reduce the amount of Company Level Taxes and (ii) provide notice to the Liberty Member of any withholding of material taxes on amounts distributable or otherwise payable to the Company or its Subsidiaries that are attributable to the Liberty Member as soon   59








________________






as reasonably practicable after the Company becomes aware of such withholding and the Company and the Liberty Member shall cooperate in Good Faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable law, the amount of any such withholding, including by providing any certificates or forms that are reasonably requested to establish an exemption from (or reduction in) any such withholding. Any determinations made by the Managing Member pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall be binding on the Members.   


  


(c) Tax Contribution and Indemnity Obligation. Any amounts withheld or paid with respect to a Member pursuant to Section 9.5(a) or Section 9.5(b) (other than the payment of Company Level Taxes) shall be offset against any distributions to which such Member is entitled concurrently with such withholding or payment (a “Tax Offset”); provided that the reduction in the amount of any distribution as a result of a Tax Offset shall be treated as having been distributed to such Member pursuant to Section 5.1 or Section 10.3(b)(iii) at the time such Tax Offset is made. To the extent that (i) the amount of such Tax Offset exceeds the distributions to which such Member is entitled concurrently with such withholding or payment (an “Excess Tax Amount”), or (ii) there is a payment of Company Level Taxes relating to a Member, the amount of such (A) Excess Tax Amount or (B) Company Level Taxes, as applicable, shall, upon notification to such Member by the Managing Member, give rise to an obligation of such Member to make a capital contribution to the Company (a “Tax Contribution Obligation”), which Tax Contribution Obligation shall be immediately due and payable. If a Member defaults with respect to its Tax Contribution Obligation, the Company shall be entitled to offset the amount of a Member’s Tax Contribution Obligation against distributions to which such Member would otherwise be subsequently entitled until the full amount of such Tax Contribution Obligation has been contributed to the Company or has been recovered through offset against distributions and, for the avoidance of doubt, any such offset shall be treated as distributed to such Member pursuant to Section 5.1 or Section 10.3(b), as applicable, at the time such offset is made. In the case of a Tax Contribution Obligation arising from the payment of Company Level Taxes, then to the extent that the Managing Member determines it is appropriate for purposes of properly maintaining Capital Accounts, (x) any payment by a Member with respect to such Member’s Tax Contribution Obligation shall increase such Member’s Capital Account, but shall not reduce the amount (if any) that a Member is otherwise obligated to contribute to the Company, and (y) any recovery of such Tax Contribution Obligation through an offset against distributions to such Member shall not reduce such Member’s Capital Account by the amount of such offset. Each Member hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Company a security interest in such Member’s Units to secure such Member’s obligation to pay the Company any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 9.5. Each Member shall take such actions as the Company may reasonably request in order to perfect or enforce the security interest created hereunder. Each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the other Members, the Company Representative and the Managing Member from and against any liability (including any liability for Company Level Taxes) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other payments to such Member.   60

(d) Continued Obligations of Former Members. Any Person who ceases to be a Member shall be deemed to be a Member solely for purposes of this Section 9.5, and the obligations of a Member pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall survive until thirty (30) days after the closing of the applicable statute of limitations on assessment with respect to the taxes withheld or paid by the Company or a Subsidiary that relate to the period during which such Person was actually a Member; provided that the Company notifies the former Member within 45 days of withholding or paying any such taxes on behalf of such Member. If the Managing Member determines in Good Faith that seeking indemnification for Company Level Taxes from a former Member is not practicable, or that seeking such indemnification failed, then, in either case, the Managing Member may (i) recover any liability for Company Level Taxes from the substituted Member that acquired directly or indirectly the applicable interest in the Company from such former Member or (ii) treat such liability for Company Level Taxes as a Company expense.   


  


(e) Managing Member Discretion Regarding Recovery of Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Managing Member may choose not to recover an amount of Company Level Taxes or other taxes withheld or paid with respect to a Member under this Section 9.5 to the extent that there are no distributions to which such Member is entitled that may be offset by such amounts if the Managing Member determines, in Good Faith, that such a decision would be in the best interests of the Members (e.g., where the cost of recovering the amount of taxes withheld or paid with respect to such Member is not justified in light of the amount that may be recovered from such Member).

KKR will allocate such investment opportunities among the Company and EIGF II, on the one hand, and such Other KKR Funds, on the other hand, in a manner consistent with the priority investment rights of the Other KKR Funds as is reasonably determined by KKR, taking into account such factors as KKR deems appropriate, which may include, for example, investment objectives, target investment sizes, available capital, the expected hold period for an investment, timing of capital inflows and outflows and anticipated capital commitments and subscriptions, liquidity, applicable concentration limits and other investment restrictions, mandatory minimum investment rights and other contractual obligations applicable to participating funds, vehicles, and accounts and/or their investors, portfolio diversification, tax efficiencies and potential adverse tax consequences, regulatory restrictions applicable to participating funds, vehicles, and/or their investors, policies and restrictions (including internal policies and procedures) applicable to participating funds, vehicles, and accounts, the avoidance of odd lots or cases where a pro rata allocation would result in a de minimis allocation to one or more participating funds, vehicles, and accounts, the potential dilutive effect of a new position, the overall risk profile of a portfolio, the potential return available from a debt investment as compared to an equity investment and other factors deemed relevant by KKR.   14








________________


(d) Where investments that are consistent with the Company’s Investment Guidelines are shared with one or more Other KKR Funds, the Manager may, but is not obligated to, aggregate sales and purchase orders of securities and other investments of the Company with similar orders being made simultaneously for such Other KKR Funds, if in the Manager’s judgment, such aggregation is likely to result generally in an overall economic benefit to the Company. The determination of such economic benefit to the Company by the Manager is subjective and represents the Manager’s evaluation that the Company is benefited by relatively better purchase or sales prices, lower commission expenses, increased access to investment opportunities, beneficial timing of transactions or a combination of these and other factors. 


(e) The Board may periodically review the Investment Guidelines. The Manager shall not consummate on behalf of the Company any transaction that involves (i) the sale of any investment to or (ii) the acquisition of any investment from, KKR, any Other KKR Fund or any of their Affiliates unless such transaction (A) is on terms no less favorable to the Company than could have been obtained on an arm’s length basis from an unrelated third party and (B) has been approved in advance by a majority of the Independent Directors. In connection with the foregoing, it is understood and/or agreed for greater certainty that while conflicts of interests may arise from time-to-time in connection with the investment activities of the Company, KKR and the Other KKR Funds and that the Manager will resolve any such conflicts of interest in a fair and equitable manner in accordance with the Investment Allocation Policy and its prevailing policies and procedures with respect to conflicts resolution among Other KKR Funds generally, only those transactions set forth above shall be required to be presented for approval by the Independent Directors; provided, that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of the Manager, in its discretion, to present additional matters involving the Company to the Independent Directors from time-to-time for review, advice and/or approval to the extent the Manager reasonably determines that doing so is appropriate under the circumstances (including, without limitation, as a result of a determination that such matters give rise to material conflicts of interest that are appropriate to be reviewed and/or approved by the Independent Directors); provided, further, that if the majority of the Independent Directors approve any matter or transaction presented for their approval despite a conflict of interest after the Manager has disclosed all material facts relating to such conflict of interest, then the Manager shall not have any liability to the Company or any stockholder by reason of such conflict of interest for actions in respect of such matter taken in good faith by any of them, including actions in the pursuit of their own interests. 


(f) The Manager shall provide the lead Independent Director (or, if none, the chairman of the audit committee) with written notice in the event that the Manager is engaged in a material investment or activity which conflicts with the Company’s interests other than as contemplated herein. 


Section 4. Bank Accounts. At the direction of the Board, the Manager may establish and maintain, as agent on behalf of the Company, one or more bank accounts with a “qualified custodian” in the name of the Company or any Subsidiary in accordance with applicable law, and may cause the Company to deposit into any such account or accounts, and disburse funds from any such account or accounts, under such terms and conditions as the Board may approve; and the Manager shall ensure that such custodian(s) from time to time render statements, including appropriate accountings of such collections and payments to the Board and, upon request, to the auditors of the Company or any Subsidiary.   15

Section 5. Records; Confidentiality. 


The Manager shall maintain appropriate books of account, records and files relating to services performed hereunder, and such books of account, records and files shall be accessible for inspection by representatives of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time during normal business hours upon advance written notice. Manager shall also provide the Company, its subsidiaries and their representatives, independent accounting firms and outside consultants with reasonable access to appropriate personnel of the Manager so as to enable the accountants and consultants to conduct the Company’s audit and to review, design and test the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. The Manager shall have full responsibility for the maintenance, care and safekeeping of all such books of account, records and files (it being understood that services may be provided with respect to the Company by service providers (e.g., administrators, prime brokers and custodians) and so long as such service providers are monitored by the Manager with due care, the Manager shall be in compliance with the foregoing). Until the second (2nd) anniversary of the termination of this Agreement, the Manager shall keep confidential any and all Confidential Information and shall not use Confidential Information in contravention of its duties under this Agreement or disclose Confidential Information, in whole or in part, to any Person other than (i) to officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, advisors of the Manager or its Affiliates who need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of rendering services hereunder or in furtherance of KKR’s asset management or capital markets businesses, (ii) to appraisers, lenders or other financing sources, co-originators, custodians, administrators, brokers, commercial counterparties or any similar entity and others in the ordinary course of the Company’s business ((i) and (ii) collectively, “Manager Permitted Disclosure Parties”), (iii) in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings of the Company or its Affiliates (including, any filings made by KKR as a result of its status as a public company) or disclosure or presentations to investors of the Company or KKR (subject to compliance with Regulation FD), (iv) to governmental agencies or officials having jurisdiction over the Company or the Manager, (v) as required by law or legal process or requested by applicable regulatory authorities, in each case, to which the Manager or any Person to whom disclosure is permitted hereunder is a party or subject, (vi) to existing or prospective investors in Other KKR Funds and their advisors to the extent such persons reasonably request such information, subject to an undertaking of confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-use, or (vii) otherwise with the consent of the Company, including pursuant to a separate agreement entered into between the Manager and/or any Other KKR Funds and the Company. The Manager agrees to inform each of its Manager Permitted Disclosure Parties of the non-public nature of the Confidential Information. Nothing herein shall prevent the Manager from disclosing Confidential Information (i) upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (ii) upon the request or demand of, or pursuant to any law or regulation to, any regulatory agency or authority, (iii) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, or (iv) to its legal counsel or independent auditors; provided, however that with respect to clause (i), it is agreed that, so long as not legally prohibited, the Manager will (x) consider, and if advisable seek, at the Company’s sole expense, an appropriate protective order or confidentiality agreement, (y) notify the Board of such disclosure, and (z) in the absence of an appropriate protective order or confidentiality agreement, disclose only that portion of such information that is responsive to such request or demand.   16

(b) The Management Fee shall be payable in arrears in cash, in quarterly installments commencing with the calendar quarter in which the Effective Date occurs. If applicable, the initial and final installments of the Management Fee shall be pro-rated based on the number of days during the initial and final quarter, respectively, that this Agreement is in effect. The Manager shall calculate each quarterly installment of the Management Fee, and deliver such calculation to the Company within thirty (30) days following the last day of each calendar quarter. The Company shall pay the Manager each installment of the Management Fee within five (5) Business Days after the date of delivery to the Company of such calculation. 


(c) The Manager is entitled to Incentive Compensation that consists of five tranches (the “Initial Award”), and each tranche relates to a target number of shares of Common Stock equal to 2% of the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the time such tranche is settled (the “Initial Award Target Amount”), if applicable. So long as the Manager continuously provides services to the Company, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, until the end of the performance period applicable to a tranche of the Initial Award, the Manager is entitled to settlement of such tranche with respect to a number of shares of Common Stock ranging from 0% to 240% of the Initial Award Target Amount based on the level of achievement with respect to the performance goals applicable to such tranche, subject to and limited by the availability of such shares under the relevant equity compensation plan governing the Initial Award and, if such shares are not available, all or a portion of such tranche shall be settled in cash. The Initial Award shall be granted pursuant to an award agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “Award Agreement”). Following the fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the Manager will be entitled to additional Incentive Compensation on an annual basis (each, a “Subsequent Award”), and each Subsequent Award shall relate to at least a target number of shares of Common Stock equal to 2% of the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the time such Subsequent Award is settled (the “Subsequent Award Target Amount”), if applicable. So long as the Manager continuously provides services to the Company, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, until the end of the performance period applicable to a Subsequent Award, the Manager is entitled to settlement of such Subsequent Award with respect to a number of shares of Common Stock ranging from 0% to 240% of the Subsequent Award Target Amount based on the level of achievement with respect to the performance goals applicable to such Subsequent Award (as such performance goals may be adjusted with the consent of the Manager), subject to and limited by the availability of such shares under the relevant equity compensation plan governing the Subsequent Award and, if such shares are not available, all or a portion of such Subsequent Award shall be settled in cash. Each Subsequent Award shall be granted pursuant to an award agreement that is generally consistent with the Award Agreement (except to the extent any performance goals are modified in accordance with the foregoing). The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to adopt such equity compensation plans, the Award Agreement and obtain any approvals (including shareholder approvals, if applicable) necessary to permit the issuance of the Incentive Compensation contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any issuances and acquisitions of Common Stock as Incentive Compensation contemplated by this Agreement to qualify for an exemption under Section 16(b)of the Exchange Act, if applicable.   17

________________


non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, the applicable Person committed bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence under this Agreement. The Company shall, to the full extent lawful, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless the Manager, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders, and equityholders, and directors, officers, employees, agents, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders and equityholders of the foregoing (each, a “Manager Indemnified Party”), of and from any and all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges, settlements and claims of any nature whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively “Losses”) in respect of or arising from any Proceeding related to the Company or acts or omissions of such Manager Indemnified Party in connection with this Agreement, except (i) in connection with any Proceedings that were caused by an internal dispute among Manager and its Affiliates, including but not limited to their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders, and equityholders and (ii) to the extent there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, a Manager Indemnified Party committed bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence under this Agreement. 


(b) The Manager shall, to the full extent lawful, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the directors, officers, employees, agents and stockholders of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each Person, if any, controlling the Company (each, a “Company Indemnified Party”; a Manager Indemnified Party and a Company Indemnified Party are each sometimes hereinafter referred to as an “Indemnified Party”) of and from any and all Losses in respect of or arising from (i) any acts or omissions of the Manager constituting bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence under this Agreement or (ii) any claims by the Manager’s or its Affiliate’s employees relating to the terms and conditions of their employment by the Manager or its Affiliate. 


(c) In case any such claim, suit, action, investigation or Proceeding (a “Claim”) is brought against any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification may be sought by such Indemnified Party pursuant hereto, the Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the indemnifying party, which notice shall include all documents and information in the possession of or under the control of such Indemnified Party reasonably necessary for the evaluation and/or defense of such Claim and shall specifically state that indemnification for such Claim is being sought under this Section; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the indemnifying party shall not limit or affect such Indemnified Party’s rights other than pursuant to this Section 8(c) unless the failure to provide such notice results in material prejudice to the indemnifying party. Upon receipt of such notice of Claim (together with such documents and information from such Indemnified Party), the indemnifying party shall, at its sole cost and expense, in good faith control and defend any such Claim (including any settlement thereof) with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, which counsel may, without limiting the rights of such Indemnified Party pursuant to the next succeeding sentence of this Section 8(c), also represent the indemnifying party in such Claim. In the alternative, such Indemnified Party may elect to conduct the defense of the Claim, if (i) such Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the conduct of its defense by the indemnifying party could be materially prejudicial to its interests, (ii) the indemnifying party refuses to assume such defense (or fails to give written notice to the indemnified Party within ten (10) days of receipt of a notice of Claim that the indemnifying party assumes such defense), or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed,   23

in such Indemnified Party’s reasonable judgment, to defend the Claim in good faith. The indemnifying party may settle any Claim against such Indemnified Party; provided (i) such settlement is without any Losses (including equitable relief) whatsoever to such Indemnified Party, (ii) the settlement does not include or require any admission of liability or culpability by such Indemnified Party and (iii) the indemnifying party obtains an effective written release of liability for such Indemnified Party from the party to the Claim with whom such settlement is being made, which release must be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party, and a dismissal with prejudice with respect to all claims made by the party against such Indemnified Party in connection with such Claim. Subject to the immediately prior sentence, the applicable Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying party, at the indemnifying party’s sole cost and expense, in connection with the defense or settlement of any Claim in accordance with the terms hereof. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any Losses associated with a settlement entered into by an Indemnified Party unless the indemnifying party consents to such settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If such Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to this Section 8 to elect to defend such Claim by counsel of its own choosing and so elects, then the indemnifying party shall be responsible for Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with any settlement of such Claim entered into by such Manager Indemnified Party in good faith. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no Indemnified Party may pay or settle any Claim and seek reimbursement therefor under this Section. 


(d) Upon written request by a Manager Indemnified Party, the Company shall pay reasonable expenses (including attorney’s fees) incurred (or reasonably expected to be incurred) by such Manager Indemnified Party in defending or investigating a Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding; provided, that prior to payment (or advancement) by the Company of any such expenses, the Manager Indemnified Party shall provide an unsecured undertaking to the Company to repay all such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that such Manager Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized by this Section 8. 


(e) The provisions of this Section 8 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. 


(f) Notwithstanding that a Manager Indemnified Party may have certain rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses provided by other persons (collectively, the “Other Indemnitors”), with respect to the rights to an advancement of expenses or indemnification set forth herein, the Company: (i) shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to such indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such indemnitee are secondary); and (ii) shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by such indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all liabilities, without regard to any rights such indemnitee may have against any of the Other Indemnitors.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or otherwise, the rights and protections provided under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any rights to indemnification, reimbursement, advancement of expenses, exculpation or other rights and protections of any Manager Indemnified Party under the Governing Agreements of the Company or any Subsidiary, any agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Manager Indemnified Party, on the other, any action by the Board or stockholders of the Company or any equivalent governing body or equityholders of any Subsidiary, or applicable law. 


Section 9. No Joint Venture. The Company and the Manager are not partners or joint venturers with each other and nothing herein shall be construed to make them such partners or joint venturers or impose any liability as such on either of them. 


Section 10. Term; Renewal; Termination Without Cause. 


(a) This Agreement became effective on the Effective Date and shall continue in operation, unless terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, until the third anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”). After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall be deemed renewed automatically at the end of the Initial Term and each subsequent Automatic Renewal Term (as defined below) for an additional three-year period (an “Automatic Renewal Term”) unless the Company or the Manager elects not to renew this Agreement in accordance with Section 10(b) or Section 10(d), respectively. 


(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, upon the written notice to the Manager at least one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Automatic Renewal Term (the “Termination Notice”), the Company may, without cause, in connection with the expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Automatic Renewal Term, decline to renew this Agreement (any such nonrenewal, a “Termination Without Cause”) upon the affirmative determination by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors reasonably and in good faith that (1) there has been unsatisfactory long-term performance by the Manager that is materially detrimental to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (2) the Management Fee and Incentive Compensation payable to the Manager, in the aggregate, is materially unfair and excessive compared to those that would be charged by a comparable asset manager managing assets comparable to the assets of the Company, subject to Section 10(c) below. In the event of a Termination Without Cause, the Company shall pay the Manager the Termination Fee before or on the last day of the Initial Term or such Automatic Renewal Term, as the case may be (the “Effective Termination Date”). The Company may terminate this Agreement for Cause pursuant to Section 12 even after a Termination Notice and, in such case, no Termination Fee shall be payable. 


(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) above, if the reason for nonrenewal specified in the Company’s Termination Notice is that at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors have determined that the Management Fee and Incentive Compensation is materially unfair, the Company shall not have the foregoing nonrenewal right in the event the Manager agrees that it will continue to perform its duties hereunder during the Automatic Renewal Term that would commence upon the expiration of the Initial Term or then current Automatic Renewal Term at a fee that at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Independent Directors determine to be fair; provided, however, the Manager shall have the right to renegotiate the Management Fee   25

and/or Incentive Compensation by delivering to the Company, not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the pending Effective Termination Date, written notice (a “Notice of Proposal to Negotiate”) of its intention to renegotiate the Management Fee and/or the Incentive Compensation. Thereupon, the Company and the Manager shall endeavor to negotiate the Management Fee and/or Incentive Compensation in good faith. Provided that the Company and the Manager agree to a revised Management Fee and/or Incentive Compensation or other compensation structure within sixty (60) days following the Company’s receipt of the Notice of Proposal to Negotiate, the Termination Notice from the Company shall be deemed of no force and effect, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect on the terms stated herein, except that the Management Fee and/or the Incentive Compensation or other compensation structure shall be the revised Management Fee and/or Incentive Compensation or other compensation structure as then agreed upon by the Company and the Manager. The Company and the Manager agree to execute and deliver an amendment to this Agreement setting forth such revised Management Fee, Incentive Compensation, or other compensation structure promptly upon reaching an agreement regarding same. In the event that the Company and the Manager are unable to agree to a revised Management Fee and/or Incentive Compensation or other compensation structure during such sixty (60) day period, this Agreement shall terminate on the Effective Termination Date and the Company shall be obligated to pay the Manager the Termination Fee upon the Effective Termination Date. 


(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) above, if the reason for nonrenewal specified in the Company’s Termination Notice is that there has been materially unsatisfactory long-term performance by the Manager that is materially detrimental to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company shall not have the foregoing nonrenewal right in the event the Manager has addressed the underlying performance issues, as reasonably determined in good faith by at least two-thirds (2/3) of Independent Directors, during the one hundred twenty (120) day period following the delivery of the applicable Termination Notice. 


(e) No later than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the then current Automatic Renewal Term, the Manager may deliver written notice to the Company informing it of the Manager’s intention to decline to renew this Agreement, whereupon this Agreement shall not be renewed and extended and this Agreement shall terminate effective on the anniversary date of this Agreement next following the delivery of such notice. The Company is not required to pay to the Manager the Termination Fee if the Manager terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10(d). 


(f) Except as set forth in this Section 10, a nonrenewal of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without any further liability or obligation of either party to the other and the terms and provisions hereof shall terminate, except as provided in Section 3(a), Section 5, Section 7, Section 8 and Section 14 of this Agreement. 


(g) The Manager shall cooperate, at the Company’s expense, with the Company in executing an orderly transition of the management of the Company’s consolidated assets to a new manager.   26

In addition, the assignee shall execute and deliver to the Company a counterpart of this Agreement naming such assignee as the Manager.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall preclude any pledge, hypothecation or other transfer of any amounts payable to the Manager under this Agreement. 


(b) Assignments by the Company. This Agreement shall not be assigned by the Company without the prior written consent of the Manager.

(b) The Manager may terminate this Agreement effective upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice of termination to the Company in the event that the Company shall default in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained in this Agreement and such default shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof specifying such default and requesting that the same be remedied in such 30-day period. The Company is required to pay to the Manager the Termination Fee if the termination of this Agreement is made pursuant to this Section 12(b).

Upon any such termination, the Manager shall forthwith:   27

(b) deliver to the Board a full accounting, including a statement showing all payments collected by it and a statement of all money held by it, covering the period following the date of the last accounting furnished to the Board with respect to the Company and any Subsidiaries; and 


(c) deliver to the Board all property and documents of the Company and any Subsidiaries then in the custody of the Manager, provided that the Manager shall be permitted to retain copies of such documents for its records, and if so retained, the Manager shall continue to be bound by the confidentiality obligations and other obligations set forth in Section 5 hereof with respect to the retained documents. 


Section 14. Release of Money or Other Property Upon Written Request. 


The Manager agrees that any money or other property of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be held in the name of the Company or any Subsidiary, and in the case of securities and funds of the Company, shall be maintained by a qualified custodian in the name of the Company or any Subsidiary in accordance with applicable law. The Manager shall not be liable to the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders, and equityholders for any acts or omissions by the Company in connection with the money or other property held by such custodian(s) in accordance with this Section. The Company shall indemnify the Manager and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders, and equityholders and agents, against any and all Losses which arise in connection with the Manager’s proper release or direction of such money or other property to the Company’s custodian(s) in accordance with the terms of this Section 14.

Exhibit A 


Investment Guidelines 


The objective of the Company is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and cash distributions to shareholders, capital appreciation and long-term exposure to oil and natural gas prices through a diverse portfolio of oil and natural gas properties. In connection therewith, the Company will invest in onshore investment opportunities in the lower 48 states of the United States with a core focus on investments in (a) oil and gas working interests; (b) minerals and royalties; and (c) opportunistic financings, in each case structured either through asset-level investments or through structured investments in businesses owning these interests and/or related assets. 


The Company will seek to differentiate itself as an energy company through a combination of (i) disciplined business strategy focused on cash-on-cash returns; (ii) the unique management capabilities of the Manager; (iii) proactive efforts to optimize cost of capital; (iv) operational value-add; (v) flexible investment horizon; and (vi) best-in-class management of ESG and sustainability impacts. The portfolio of investments will be managed holistically to optimize the attractiveness as a going-concern oil and gas company to prospective investors, including with regard to all asset-level decisions. 


The Company will seek to limit its exposure to particular categories of assets by not making new investments which would cause any of the following conditions to become true: (A) more than 25% of the Company’s NAV being comprised of opportunistic financings, including those in the midstream sector, (B) more than 25% of the Company’s NAV being comprised of enhanced oil recovery projects, (C) more than 25% of the Company’s NAV being comprised of mineral and royalty interests, (D) more than 50% of the Company’s NAV being comprised of gas focused assets, (E) 50% of the Company’s NAV being comprised of assets operated by the same operator or (F) more than 66.7% of the Company’s NAV being comprised of assets in one geologic basin. In addition, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will engage in wildcatting, speculation or service businesses. 


For purposes of this Exhibit A, “NAV” means, as reasonably determined by the Manager in good faith in accordance with the Investment Guidelines, as such policies and procedures may be modified by KKR’s valuation committee with the approval of the Board, the Company’s net asset value based on (a) the Company’s gross asset value and (b) the liabilities of the Company and its pro rata share of the liabilities of the Company’s direct and indirect Subsidiaries at such time, as adjusted by the Manager as it reasonably determines is appropriate to reflect distributions, contributions, investments, acquisitions, dispositions, capital expenditures, expenses, obligations, liabilities, income or other events occurring after such date through the applicable date of any determination.

(g) During the Effectiveness Period, the Company will furnish to each such Holder, upon request and without charge, at least one (1) conformed copy of each Registration Statement and each amendment thereto and all exhibits to the extent requested by such Holder (including those incorporated by reference) promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission; provided, that the Company will not have any obligation to provide any document pursuant to this clause that is publicly available on the Commission’s EDGAR system.   14

(h) The Company will promptly deliver to each Holder, upon request and without charge, as many copies of each Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus) authorized by the Company for use and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Holder may reasonably request during the Effectiveness Period. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including Section 8(b), the Company consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto. 


(i) The Company will cooperate with such Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates or book-entry notations, as applicable, representing Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement, which certificates or book-entry notations, as applicable, shall be free of all restrictive legends indicating that the Registrable Securities are unregistered or unqualified for resale under the Securities Act, Exchange Act or other applicable securities laws, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any such Holder may request in writing. In connection therewith, if required by the Company’s transfer agent, the Company will promptly, after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement, cause an opinion of counsel as to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement to be delivered to and maintained with its transfer agent, together with any other authorizations, certificates and directions required by the transfer agent which authorize and direct the transfer agent to issue or transfer such Registrable Securities without any such legend upon sale by the Holder of such Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement. 


(j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(e)(v), as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Company will prepare a supplement or amendment, including a post-effective amendment, if required by applicable law, to the affected Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered, no Registration Statement will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and no Prospectus will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 


(k) With respect to Underwritten Offerings, (i) the right of any Holder to include such Holder’s Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering shall be conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein, (ii) each Holder participating in such Underwritten Offering agrees to enter into an underwriting agreement in reasonable and customary form and sell such Holder’s Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled to select the managing underwriter or managing underwriters hereunder and (iii) each Holder participating in such Underwritten Offering agrees to complete and execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents customarily and reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. The Company hereby agrees with each Holder that, in connection with any Underwritten Offering in accordance with the terms hereof, it will negotiate in good faith and execute all indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements, including using all reasonable best efforts to procure customary legal opinions, auditor “comfort” letters and reports of the independent petroleum engineers of the Company relating to the oil and gas reserves of the Company included in the Registration Statement if the Company has had its reserves prepared, audited or reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.   15

(l) For a reasonable period prior to the filing of any Registration Statement and throughout the Effectiveness Period, the Company will make available, upon reasonable notice at the Company’s principal place of business or such other reasonable place, for inspection during normal business hours by a representative or representatives of the selling Holders, the managing underwriter or managing underwriters and any attorneys or accountants retained by such selling Holders or underwriters, all such financial and other information and books and records of the Company, and cause the officers, employees, counsel and independent certified public accountants of the Company to respond to such inquiries, as shall be reasonably necessary (and in the case of counsel, not violate an attorney-client privilege in such counsel’s reasonable belief) to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act; provided, that any information that is not generally publicly available at the time of delivery of such information shall be kept confidential by such Persons unless disclosure of such information is required by court or administrative order or, in the opinion of counsel to such Person, law, in which case, such Person shall be required to give the Company written notice of the proposed disclosure prior to such disclosure and, if requested by the Company, assist the Company in seeking to prevent or limit the proposed disclosure. 


(m) In connection with any Requested Underwritten Offering, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause appropriate officers and employees to be available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice, to meet with prospective investors in presentations, meetings and road shows. 


(n) Each Holder agrees to furnish to the Company any other information regarding the Holder and the distribution of such securities as the Company reasonably determines is required to be included in any Registration Statement or any Prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to an Underwritten Offering and requests from such Holder. 


(o) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to file a Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or effect a Requested Underwritten Offering (or, if the Company has filed a Shelf Registration Statement and has included Registrable Securities therein, the Company shall be entitled to suspend the offer and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement) for a reasonable period of time but not in excess of forty-five (45) days if (i) the Board reasonably determines that a postponement is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders generally due to a pending transaction involving the Company (including a pending securities offering by the Company) which filing or Requested Underwritten Offering (or failure to suspend the offer and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement) would materially interfere with such transaction, (ii) the Board reasonably determines such registration would render the Company unable to comply with applicable securities laws or (iii) the Board reasonably determines such registration would require disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide and material business purpose for preserving as confidential (any such period, a “Blackout Period”); provided, that in no event shall any Blackout Period together with any Suspension Period exceed an aggregate of one hundred (100) days in any one- (1-) year period.   16








________________


(p) In connection with an Underwritten Offering, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide to each Holder named as a selling stockholder in any Registration Statement a copy of any auditor “comfort” letters, customary legal opinions or reports of the independent petroleum engineers of the Company relating to the oil and gas reserves of the Company, in each case that have been provided to the managing underwriter or managing underwriters in connection with the Underwritten Offering, not later than the Business Day prior to the effective date of such Registration Statement. 


(q) In connection with any Underwritten Offering, any Holder that participates in such Underwritten Offering or that, together with its Affiliates owns 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock or has the right to designate a member to the Board of Directors of the Company through any shareholder, voting or other agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates, shall execute a customary “lock-up” agreement with the underwriters of such Underwritten Offering containing a lock-up period equal to the shorter of (A) the shortest number of days that any director of the Company, “executive officer” (as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) of the Company or any other holder that also participates in such Underwritten Offering, owns 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock or has the right to designate a member to the Board of Directors of the Company through any shareholder, voting or other agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates contractually agrees to (provided, that any such Holder shall be automatically released from such lock-up to the extent any release or waiver is given to any other holder, member of the Board of Directors or any executive officer of the Company) with the underwriters of such Underwritten Offering not to sell any securities of the Company following such Underwritten Offering and (B) 60 days from the date of the execution of the underwriting agreement with respect to such Underwritten Offering. 


4. No Inconsistent Agreements; Additional Rights. The Company shall not hereafter enter into, and is not currently a party to, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders by this Agreement. To the extent that the Company or any other Person on its behalf, on or after the date hereof, grants any superior or more favorable rights or terms to any Person with respect to the subject matter of the rights granted hereunder than those provided to the Liberty Holders hereunder, any such superior or more favorable rights or terms shall also be deemed to have been granted simultaneously to the Liberty Holders, and the Company shall promptly prepare and execute such documents as are necessary to reflect and provide such Liberty Holders with the benefit of such superior or more favorable rights or terms. 


5. Registration Expenses. All Registration Expenses incident to the Parties’ performance of or compliance with their respective obligations under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with any Demand Registration, Requested Underwritten Offering, Piggyback Registration or Underwritten Piggyback Offering (in each case, excluding any Selling Expenses) shall be borne by the Company, whether or not any Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to a Registration Statement. “Registration Expenses” shall include, without limitation, (a) all registration and filing fees (including fees and expenses (i) with respect to filings required to be made with the Trading Market and (ii) in compliance with applicable state securities or “Blue Sky”   17

6. Indemnification. 


(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its Affiliates and each of their respective direct and indirect partners (including partners of partners and stockholders and members of partners), members, stockholders, officers, directors, employees and any agent thereof (collectively, “Holder Indemnified Persons”), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, costs (including reasonable costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys’ fees of a single counsel representing all the Holder Indemnified Persons or, if the representation of all the Holder Indemnified Persons by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, then as many counsel as may be needed under such standards of professional conduct to represent all the Holder Indemnified Persons) and expenses, judgments, taxes, fines, penalties, diminution in value, interest, settlements or other amounts of any kind or nature whatsoever (including all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of the foregoing and consequential damages) arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which any Holder Indemnified Person may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, under the Securities Act or otherwise (collectively, “Losses”), as incurred, arising out of or relating to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which any Registrable Securities were registered, or included in any preliminary prospectus (if the Company authorized the use of such preliminary prospectus prior to the Effective Date), or in any summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus (if such free writing prospectus was authorized for use by the Company) or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the period the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or alleged omission to state in any such Registration Statement a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading or in any such preliminary prospectus (if the Company authorized the use of such preliminary prospectus prior to the Effective Date), or in any summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus (if such free writing prospectus was authorized for use by the Company)   18








________________


or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the period the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement current) a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, that the Company shall not be liable to any Holder Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim arises out of, is based upon or results from an untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, such preliminary, summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder Indemnified Person specifically for use in the preparation thereof. The Company shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any Proceeding of which the Company is aware in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder Indemnified Person or any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 6 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely. 


(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder participates, such Holder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and any agent thereof, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all Losses as incurred, arising out of or relating to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any such Registration Statement, or included in any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the Effective Date of such Registration Statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the period the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or alleged omission to state in any such Registration Statement a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading or in any such preliminary prospectus (if the Company authorized the use of such preliminary prospectus prior to the Effective Date), or in any summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus (if such free writing prospectus was authorized for use by the Company) or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the period the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement current) a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but only to the extent that the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information relating to the Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder for use therein. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability such Holder may otherwise have and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any indemnified party. In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 


(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim or there may be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those   19








________________


available to the indemnifying party, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). Failure to give prompt written notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligations hereunder. 


(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any Losses referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Holders, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by a Holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder. 


7. Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144. To the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144), and shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the Holders to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144. Upon the request of any Holder in connection with that Holder’s sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. 


8. Miscellaneous. 


(a) Remedies. In the event of actual or potential breach by the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement, each Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.   20








________________


(b) Discontinued Disposition. Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 3(e), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemental Prospectus or amended Registration Statement as contemplated by Section 3(j) or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement (a “Suspension Period”). The Company may provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the provisions of this Section 8(b). 


(c) Amendments and Waivers. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended except in a written instrument signed by the Company and Holders that hold a majority of the Registrable Securities as of the date of such waiver or amendment; provided, that (i) any waiver or amendment that would have a disproportionate adverse effect on a Holder relative to the other Holders shall require the consent of such Holder and (ii) any waiver or amendment that eliminates or modifies any specific rights granted to a Holder that is an Affiliate of either Kiko or Lanai shall require the consent of such Holder. The Company shall provide prior notice to all Holders of any proposed waiver or amendment. No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of any Party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right. 


(d) Notices. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (i) the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via electronic mail with confirmation of receipt as specified in this Section 8(d) prior to 5:00 p.m. in the time zone of the receiving party on a Business Day, (ii) the Business Day after the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via electronic mail with confirmation of receipt as specified in this Agreement later than 5:00 p.m. in the time zone of the receiving party on any date, (iii) the Business Day following the date of mailing, if sent by nationally recognized overnight courier service or (iv) upon actual receipt by the Party to whom such notice is required to be given.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the rights of a Holder pursuant to this Agreement with respect to all or any portion of its Registrable Securities may be assigned without such consent (but only with all related obligations) with respect to such Registrable Securities (and any Registrable Securities issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect to, in exchange for or in replacement of such Registrable Securities) by such Holder to a transferee of such Registrable Securities; provided, that (i) the Company is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the Registrable Securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned, (ii) either (A) the transferee of such Registrable Securities is an Affiliate of the transferring Holder or (B) the amount of Registrable Securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned is equal to at least one percent (1%) of all shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the consummation of such transfer and (iii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Company may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Holders. 


(f) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to give any Person, other than the Parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns, and the Persons entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 6, who are each hereby made an express third party beneficiary thereof, with the right to enforce their respective rights to indemnification pursuant thereto under this Agreement, any legal or equitable right, remedy, claim or benefit under or in respect of this Agreement. 


(g) Execution and Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. In the event that any signature is delivered by electronic mail transmission, such signature shall create a valid binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) the same with the same force and effect as if such signature delivered by facsimile or electronic mail transmission were the original thereof.   22

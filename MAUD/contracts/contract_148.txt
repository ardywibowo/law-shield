AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 


This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 15, 2021 (this “Agreement”), is by and between Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation (“Parent”), and Weingarten Realty Investors, a Texas real estate investment trust (the “Company”).  Parent and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.” 


WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a business combination through the merger of the Company with and into Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation of the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law, as it may be amended from time to time (the “MGCL”), and the Texas Business Organizations Code, as it may be amended from time to time (the “TBOC”); 


WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Trust Managers of the Company has unanimously approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and declared them to be advisable and in the best interests of Parent and the Company, respectively, and with respect to the Board of Trust Managers of the Company, the Company’s shareholders, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 


WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition to Parent’s willingness to enter into this Agreement, Andrew M. Alexander and Stanford J.

As a result of the Merger, the separate existence of the Company shall cease, and Parent shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”).  The Merger will have the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the MGCL and the TBOC.








________________


(b)          Effective Time.

Section 1.5          Tax Consequences.  It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and applicable state and local tax purposes), the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code. 


ARTICLE II TREATMENT OF SECURITIES 


Section 2.1          Treatment of Securities. 


(a)          Treatment of Company Common Shares.  At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company, each common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.03 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Company Restricted Share Awards but excluding (x) Company Common Shares owned directly by the Company or Parent (such excluded shares, the “Excluded Shares”) and (y) Dissenting Shares (all such outstanding shares, including Company Restricted Share Awards but excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, the “Eligible Shares”), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the following consideration on a per share basis, without interest: (i) $2.89 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”) and (ii) 1.408 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) (including such cash in lieu of fractional shares, the “Stock Consideration” and together with the Cash Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). -2-








________________


(b)          Effect of Conversion on Company Common Shares.  In addition to the effects described in Section 2.1(a) above, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company, as of the Effective Time, all of the Eligible Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each evidence of shares in book-entry form previously evidencing any of the Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate previously representing any Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company Certificates”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and the right, if any, to receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 5.11(d). 


(c)          Cancellation of Excluded Shares.  At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company, each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 


(d)          Treatment of Dissenting Shares.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of record who has complied with the applicable provisions of Subchapter H, Chapter 10 of the TBOC prior to the Effective Time (“Dissenting Shareholder Statute” and any such shares meeting the requirement of this sentence, “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with the Dissenting Shareholder Statute (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with the Dissenting Shareholder Statute); provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares under the Dissenting Shareholder Statute, then the right of such holder to any such payments shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration.  The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any written demands, notices or instruments received by the Company pursuant to the Dissenting Shareholder Statute and/or relating to the Dissenting Shareholder Statute or any alleged dissenter’s or similar rights, and any withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parent’s expense, to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, provided that Parent shall consult with the Company with respect to such negotiations and proceedings.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. -3-








________________


(e)          Parent Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger. 


Section 2.2          Exchange of Certificates. 


(a)          Exchange Agent.  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with an exchange agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (it being agreed and understood that Equiniti Trust Company is reasonably acceptable to the Company to serve as the exchange agent) (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, (i) an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in uncertificated or book-entry form comprising the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash comprising the aggregate Cash Consideration and approximately the amount required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case for the sole benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares.  In addition, in the event that the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) or any dividends or distributions, if any, to which the holders of Eligible Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), Parent shall promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment.  Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make delivery of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the cash in lieu of any fractional shares payment pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c), out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement.  Such Merger Consideration, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and the amount of any dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the “Exchange Fund.”  The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose provided for in this Agreement. 


(b)          Exchange Procedures. 


(i)          Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including (A) appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates or the Company Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificates, as provided in Section 2.7) or transfer of the Company Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an “agent’s message” with respect to the Company Book-Entry Shares) (the “Letter of Transmittal”), and (B) instructions for surrendering the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificates, as provided in Section 2.7) or transferring the Company Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or other distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  With respect to holders of the Company Book-Entry Shares, the Parties shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent to allow the Exchange Agent to promptly transmit, following the Effective Time, to such holders or their nominees, upon surrender of Eligible Shares, the Merger Consideration, including cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or other distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. -4-








________________


(ii)          Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Shares that are represented by the Company Certificates, by physical surrender of such Company Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Certificate, as provided in Section 2.7) or that are Company Book-Entry Shares, by book-receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent in connection with the transfer of Company Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with respect to Company Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with customary procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent and the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and (B) an amount (if any) in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(h)) of (1) the Cash Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a), plus (2) any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) plus (3) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 5.11(d). 


(iii)          No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Company Certificate or ledger entry relating to Company Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Company Common Shares that have been so surrendered shall be canceled by the Exchange Agent. 


(iv)          In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with an amount (if any) in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(h)) or cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Company Certificate and any dividends or other distributions in respect thereof, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the Company Certificate formerly representing such Eligible Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and Parent.  Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Company Book- Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Company Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Company Certificate and Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time at or after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II, including any amount payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e), and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(c) or Section 5.11(d), in each case without interest. -5-








________________


(c)          Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement.  No dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible Share until the Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Company Certificate as provided in Section 2.7) or the Company Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II.  Subject to applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with this Article II, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. 


(d)          Transfers.  From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.  If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Parent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 


(e)          No Fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement.  Any holder of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 2.2(e) shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of the applicable Eligible Shares, a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of any such fractional share, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all Eligible Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the VWAP of Parent Common Shares.  No holder of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock described in this Section 2.2(e) to any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock.  The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange. -6-








________________


(f)          Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Eligible Shares for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon the Surviving Corporation’s demand, and any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for delivery of any Merger Consideration and any payment of cash and any dividends and other distributions in respect thereof payable or issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.2(c), Section 2.2(e) and Section 5.11(d), in each case, without any interest thereon. 


(g)          No Liability.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(h)          Withholding.  Each of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 


Section 2.3          Further Assurances.  If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of the Company, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of any Party, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of any such Person, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or proper, in the sole discretion of the Surviving Corporation, to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporation’s right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of the Company and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. -7-








________________


Section 2.4          Treatment of Company Equity Awards. 


(a)          Restricted Share Awards.  Each award of restricted Company Common Shares that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will become vested at the Effective Time either by its terms or the terms of any Company Benefit Plan as a result of the occurrence of the Effective Time (each, a “Company Restricted Share Award”), with any applicable performance goals deemed satisfied at the target level, and as of the Effective Time, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each Company Common Share subject to the Company Restricted Share Award as of no later than the first regular payroll date of the Company or the Surviving Corporation that occurs at least ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date (or any later date required by Section 409A of the Code). 


(b)          Company ESPP.  As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Trust Managers of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required so that (i) participation in the Company ESPP shall be limited to those employees who are participants as of immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, (ii) participants may not increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions from those in effect as of immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement or make any separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement, (iii) no offering period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, and (iv) the Company ESPP shall terminate effective as of the Effective Time (and, if the Effective Time occurs in the middle of a purchase period, all payroll deductions or contributions to the Company ESPP in respect of such purchase period shall be returned to the participants and not used to purchase Company Common Shares). 


(c)          Company Actions.  Except as set forth in Section 2.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as are necessary or appropriate to provide for the treatment of the Company Restricted Share Awards and the Company ESPP as contemplated by this Section 2.4. 


Section 2.5          Effect on Operating Partnership Units. 


(a)          At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of Parent, the Company, the Raleigh Limited Partnership or the holders of Raleigh Limited Partnership Units, the Conversion Factor (as defined in the Raleigh Limited Partnership Agreement) shall equal (i) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Raleigh Limited Partnership Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Unit Exchange Ratio. 


(b)          At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of Parent, the Company, the Madison Village Limited Partnership or the holders of Madison Village Limited Partnership Units, the Equity Adjustment (as defined in the Madison Village Limited Partnership Agreement) for the outstanding Madison Village Limited Partnership Units shall equal (i) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Madison Village Limited Partnership Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Unit Exchange Ratio. -8-

Section 2.6          Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.  If, at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a change in the number of issued and outstanding Company Common Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into Company Common Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case, as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Eligible Shares and Parent with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event (provided that there shall not be more than one such adjustment for any single action, including if the Merger Consideration has been adjusted pursuant to its definition). 


Section 2.7          Lost Certificates.

(a)          As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and, in any event, within 45 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials which shall constitute the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the matters to be submitted to the Company shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting and to the Parent common stockholders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting (such joint proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus”), and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) with respect to the Parent Stock Issuance (such Form S-4, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Form S-4”).  Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information required to be disclosed in the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to the other, including all information necessary for the preparation of pro forma financial statements, and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  Prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or filing or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, and each Party will provide the other Party with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.  Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.  Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other Party with copies of any written comments and advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC.  Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger, and each Party shall furnish all information concerning it, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to either of the Parties, or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either Party, and such information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company. -61-

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(b), if, on the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Common Shares to obtain the Company Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to (and at the request of Parent shall) make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholders Meeting; provided that the Company Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law).  Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligation to submit the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.  The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, its obligations to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or its Board of Trust Managers of any Acquisition Proposal, by any Change in Recommendation or by any development, fact, circumstance or change that would give rise to a right to make a Change in Recommendation. -62-

Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the Merger to its common stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.  Parent agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, its obligations to hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting and to take the Parent Recommendation Actions pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent or its Board of Directors of any Acquisition Proposal.

Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.  The Parties will cooperate in good faith to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  No such investigation by any Party shall affect the representations and warranties of any other Party.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent or the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification or advancement pursuant to this Section 5.10, the provisions of this Section 5.10 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

In lieu of Parent’s purchase of the D&O Insurance as contemplated in the immediately foregoing sentence, the Company may purchase, prior to (but effective as of) the Effective Time, the D&O Insurance, in which event Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section 5.9(c); provided, however, that the aggregate premium for such D&O Insurance shall not exceed the Base Amount.  After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the D&O Insurance to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored.

For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be permitted to declare and pay dividends in respect of shares of Parent’s 5.125% Class L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and shares of Parent’s 5.25% Class M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, in each case pursuant to the terms thereof. 


(b)          If the Company (in consultation with Parent) determines that it is necessary to declare a Special Company Distribution in accordance with Section 4.1(b)(iv), the Company shall notify Parent in writing at least 10 Business Days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and the Merger Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to such Special Company Distribution, which shall be effected by reducing the Cash Consideration by an amount equal to the per share amount of the Special Company Distribution (it being understood that if the amount of the Special Company Distribution exceeds the amount of the Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration shall also be appropriately reduced to reflect the full effect of the portion of the Special Company Distribution that exceeds the amount of the Cash Consideration).  The record date and payment date for any dividend payable pursuant to this Section 5.11(b) shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

The record date and payment date for any dividend payable pursuant to this Section 5.11(c) shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date. 


(d)          In the event that a dividend or other distribution with respect to the Company Common Shares permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (i) a record date prior to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of the Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Shares shall be entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.2. -73-

Subject to the receipt of the opinions described in Sections 6.2(c) and 6.3(c), the parties shall treat the Merger as a tax-free “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Code and no party shall take any position for tax purposes inconsistent therewith, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

(c)          by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been consummated by 5:00 p.m., New York time, on January 15, 2022 (the “Outside Date”); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be consummated before such date;

(f)          by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (other than with respect to a material breach of Section 5.4, as to which Section 7.1(d) will apply), or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, which breach or failure to perform or to be true (i) would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) to be satisfied and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured by the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) 30 days after the giving of written notice by Parent to the Company of such breach, failure to perform or failure to be true; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) if Parent is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement such that it would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b);

Section 7.2          Effect of Termination. 


(a)          In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company or Parent or their respective trust managers or directors or Representatives or Affiliates, except as provided under Section 7.2(b), Section 7.2(e) and Section 7.2(f) and except with respect to Section 5.8, Section 5.12, the expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent in Section 5.14, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII and except for the Confidentiality Agreement, each of which shall survive such termination; provided that no Party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement. 


(b)          Company Termination Fee. 


(i)          If (A) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) or (B) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent the Company Termination Fee within two Business Days after the date of such termination. -82-








________________


(ii)          In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (A) either by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(g) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(f) and, in any case, prior to the date of termination the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal or a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and (B) within 12 months of the date of any termination referred to in clause (A) the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this Section 7.2(b)(ii), the references to “15%” in the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” will be deemed to be references to “50%”), then the Company shall, within two Business Days of the earlier of the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated or any such Acquisition Agreement is entered into, pay to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent the Company Termination Fee. 


(c)          In no event shall this Section 7.2 require the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 


(d)          If Parent decides to apply for a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the receipt of the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance (if any) requested by Parent with respect thereto. 


(e)          The payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be compensation and liquidated damages for the loss suffered by Parent as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances and neither Party shall have any other liability to the other after the payment of the Company Termination Fee, except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company Termination Fee shall become due and payable in connection with this Section 7.2, from and after such termination and payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.2 and except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach, the Company shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the termination of this Agreement, other than as provided in this Section 7.2.  Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.  Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay all amounts due to Parent under this Section 7.2 on the dates specified, then the Company shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in The Wall Street Journal, from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by Parent. -83-








________________


(f)          The “Company Termination Fee” shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $115,000,000 (the “Company Base Amount”) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the “REIT Requirements”) for such year determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined in good faith by independent accountants to Parent (taking into account any known or anticipated income of Parent which is not Qualifying Income and any appropriate “cushion” as determined by such accountants).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that Parent’s receipt of the Company Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Company Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Company Base Amount and the Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Company Base Amount within five Business Days.  In the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Company Base Amount due to the above limitations, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that Parent’s receipt of the unpaid Company’s Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, in which event the Company shall pay to Parent the unpaid Company Base Amount within five Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof.  The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Company Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five years from the date of this Agreement.  Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee terminates shall be released to the Company.  “Qualifying Income” shall mean income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)–(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)–(I) of the Code.  “Tax Guidance” shall mean a reasoned opinion from counsel or other tax advisor or a ruling from the IRS.

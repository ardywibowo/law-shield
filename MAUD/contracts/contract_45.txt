Section 2.6 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a) the Effective Time and (b) any termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, the outstanding shares of Company Stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Stock) shall have been changed into a different number of shares or securities or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company Stock (including Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Stock) the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.6 shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

At or immediately prior to the Effective Time on the Closing Date, (i) Parent and the Company shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the Paying Agent the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 2.12 and the Escrow Agreement and (ii) Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in an aggregate amount that, when taken together with the Escrow Amount, is sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company Stock in accordance with this Article II (together, the “Payment Fund”). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5 out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this Section 2.8.

(b) Payment Procedures. (i) Certificates. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. (ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form or such other information or procedures as may be required by the Paying Agent (it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such shares of Company Stock upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such “agent’s message” or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Book-Entry Shares.   26








________________


(iii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than shares of Company Stock canceled pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and Appraisal Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (together, in the case of a Certificate, with a letter of transmittal in customary form, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent pursuant to such instructions) the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II. 


(c) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form, in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 


(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Stock after the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of any Merger Consideration payable to such holder. 


(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as provided in this Article II.   27








________________


(g) The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment income or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this Article II. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent promptly upon its request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Stock; provided, further, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this Article II. If at any time following the Effective Time for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations. 


Section 2.9 Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect.

(d) Company DSUs. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Company DSUs (whether vested or unvested) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and each such Company DSU shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash, without interest and subject to any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with Section 2.11, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company DSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

(f) Non-U.S. Employees. Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held by Employees subject to non-U.S. Law in a manner other than that contemplated above in this Section 2.10 to the extent necessary to take into account applicable non-U.S. Law or Tax considerations.   29

Section 6.2 Director and Officer Indemnification. 


(a) For a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless each former and present director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, a “Company Indemnified Party”) to the extent permitted by Law and as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any indemnification agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is legally as in effect on the date of this Agreement bound, as in and made available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. All rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in effect as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the Company Indemnified Parties shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all the terms thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Company Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.2, the provisions of this Section 6.2 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims relating thereto 


(b) For a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws and comparable organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of the Company (or in such documents of any successor thereto) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, during such six year period, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who immediately before the Effective Time was a Company Indemnified Party, except as required by applicable Law or Order. 


(c) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) continue to maintain in effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time the Company’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies (the “D&O Insurance”) in place as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) purchase comparable D&O Insurance (from a carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s D&O Insurance carrier) for such six-year period, in each case, with coverage for the persons who are covered by the Company’s existing D&O Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Company’s existing D&O Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the Company’s current aggregate annual premium amount as set forth in Section 6.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the “Premium Cap”); provided, further, that if the amount necessary to procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Premium Cap, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase the most advantageous policy available for an amount not to exceed the Premium Cap. At the option of either Parent or the Company, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid “tail policy” for a period of 6 years after the Effective Time with coverage for the persons who are covered by the Company’s existing D&O Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Company’s existing D&O Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, in which event Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section 6.2(b); provided that the aggregate premium for such “tail policy” and any policy maintained or purchased by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.2(c) shall not exceed the Premium Cap. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a “tail policy,” the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail policy” in full force and effect for the period of such “tail policy” (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be no less than six years after the Effective Time) and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.   65








________________


(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to succeed to or assume the applicable obligations of such Party set forth in this Section 6.2. 


(e) The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall survive consummation of the Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise. 


Section 6.3 Employee Matters. 


(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter for two years (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, Continuing Employees with (i) wage or base salary levels that are not less than those provided to such Continuing Employees by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus opportunities provided to such Continuing Employees by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing Employee with employee benefits that are at least as favorable (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) the value of any equity or other long-term incentive opportunities or (y) any retention or change in control compensation) to those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing; provided that during the Continuation Period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree to keep in effect all severance plans, agreements, practices and policies that are applicable to Employees and set forth in Section 6.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and agree that each Continuing Employee shall, during the Continuation Period, be provided with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided under such plans, agreements, practices and policies (or such greater benefits as are required after giving effect to the acknowledgment in Section 6.3(d)). Except as set forth in Section 6.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or a CBA, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the right of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or any of their respective Affiliates to (A) terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time, (B) change or modify the terms or conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee to the extent such change is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 6.3 or (C) change or modify any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with its terms; provided that such change or modification does not otherwise violate the requirements of this Section 6.3. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to obligate Parent to provide non-qualified deferred compensation or defined benefit compensation (other than as required by Law) in the same form as provided prior to the Closing Date so long as the value thereof as in effect prior to the Effective Time is replaced during the Continuation Period in some other manner to the extent provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation and benefits treatment and terms and conditions of employment provided to all non-union Continuing Employees in Canada shall be at sufficient levels to avoid constructive dismissal.   66








________________


(b) For all purposes (exclusive of purposes of defined benefit pension accrual or other plans providing for post-employment benefits including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to any deferred compensation plan, for Employees who are not entitled to such benefits immediately prior to the Closing or pursuant to a CBA) under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Parent and its respective Affiliates in which Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing (the “New Benefit Plans”), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with the same amount of service as was credited by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under similar or comparable Company Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (except (x) to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or the funding thereof or (y) with respect to new benefit or compensation arrangements that are not a replacement for a Company Plan and past service is not required to be credited). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) with respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing, Parent or its respective Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each Continuing Employee will immediately be eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately before such commencement of participation and (ii) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company Plan ending on the Closing Date to be taken into account under such New Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit Plan (except to the extent such payment would result in a duplication of benefits or the funding thereof).   67

(c) In furtherance of Section 6.3(a)(ii), if the Closing Date occurs prior to the payment of any outstanding amounts under each Company Plan that is a fiscal 2021 cash-based short-term bonus plan, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to (A) pay, at the time that the Company and its Subsidiaries would have customarily made such bonus payments, a bonus to each Continuing Employee who participates in a Company Plan that is a fiscal 2021 cash-based short-term bonus plan that is no less than the amount earned (but not paid) for such Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date under each such plan, as determined and paid in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the conditions of, the applicable Company Plan, and (B) to the extent the Effective Time occurs in calendar year 2021, maintain the short-term cash incentive plans in effect for the remainder of calendar year 2021 on the same terms and conditions, and with respect to the same targets and performance measures, as were in effect for such year. In furtherance of Section 6.3(a)(ii), to the extent the Company has adopted a Company Plan that is a fiscal 2022 cash-based short-term bonus plan, as permitted under Section 5.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to pay, at the time that the Company and its Subsidiaries would have customarily made such bonus payments, a bonus to each Continuing Employee who participates in each such Company Plan that is no less than the amount earned (but not paid) for such Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date under each such plan, as determined and paid in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the conditions of, the applicable Company Plan. 


(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.3(a), the compensation and benefits treatment and terms and conditions of employment afforded to all Continuing Employees who are covered by a CBA shall be provided in accordance with the applicable CBA. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to assume, the obligations of the CBAs until their respective expiration dates and treat the bargaining unit employees covered by such CBAs in accordance with the terms of the CBAs, as may be amended from time to time by the parties thereto. Each of the unions set forth on Section 6.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be a third-party beneficiary of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.3(d) only, as required under the applicable CBA. 


(e) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger will constitute a “change in control” or “change of control” (or other similar phrase) for purposes of any Company Plan that contains a definition of “change in control” or “change of control” (or similar phrase), as applicable. 


(f) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall honor all Company Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall limit the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to provide compensation and benefits to Continuing Employees in accordance with this Agreement through plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time. 


(g) Following the Closing Date, Parent, in consultation with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, shall adopt a long-term incentive program for key employees that provides for long-term incentives comparable to those offered to such key employees prior to the Closing Date.   68

(c) If, at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.2 and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) such Company Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (ii) that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, then the Company may (A) at the request of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal, furnish nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group (or any of their Representatives) making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) engage in, enter into or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group and their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that (w) prior to or concurrently with furnishing any nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or group or their respective Representatives, the Company enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group making such Company Acquisition Proposal, (x) prior to or concurrently with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously made available to Parent or its Representatives) and (y) the Company shall not pay, agree to pay or cause to be paid, or reimburse, agree to reimburse or cause to be reimbursed, the expenses of any such Person or group or their Representatives in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals or offers or other efforts or attempts that may lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal), in each case, without the prior written consent of Parent and (z) any competitively sensitive information or data provided to any such Person or group or their Representatives will be provided in a separate “clean data room” and subject to customary “clean team” arrangements regarding access to such information or data, as reasonably determined by the Company upon the advice from its outside legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company’s Representatives may in any event inform a Person or group that has made a Company Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this Section 7.2.   73








________________


(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) notify Parent of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or would reasonably be expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the name of such Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request and include unredacted copies of any written documents or materials delivered to the Company in connection with such proposal or offer (including any materials related to such Person’s proposed financing sources) (or where no such copies are available, a reasonably detailed written description thereof). The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt), regarding any changes or developments to the status and terms of any such proposal or offer (including any material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Company’s intentions as previously notified to Parent and (ii) provide to Parent unredacted copies of any written documents or materials delivered to the Company in connection with such changes or developments. 


(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to Section 7.2(f), prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.2, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) and concurrently pay the fees required by Section 9.3 in order to enter into a definitive agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal) if: (i) (A) a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.2 and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn prior to such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) there has been an Intervening Event; (ii) in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; and (iii) in the case of an Intervening Event, the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.   74

(f) Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement: (i) the Company Board shall provide Parent at least four Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, in the case of a Superior Proposal, all required information under Section 7.2(d) and, in the case of an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event; (ii) during the four Business Days following such written notice, the Company Board shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent requested by Parent) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable; and (iii) at the end of the four Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking into account any legally binding (if accepted by the Company) adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable (A) the Company Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) the Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws (it being understood and agreed that any material amendments or other material revisions to any Company Acquisition Proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder will be deemed to be a new Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but, with respect to any subsequent notice, references herein to “four Business Days” shall be deemed references to “two Business Days”). 


(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that this Section 7.2(g) shall not permit the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent otherwise specifically permitted by this Section 7.2; provided, further, that, if such disclosure does not reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation or has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 9.1(c)(i). For the avoidance of doubt, any “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.   75

Section 7.3 Financing. 


(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt Financing (including, if applicable, any Substitute Debt Financing) on or prior to the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) (A) maintain in effect the Debt Letters and comply with all of their respective covenants and obligations thereunder, (B) negotiate and, assuming all conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing reflecting the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Letters (including any “flex” provisions), so that such agreements are in effect no later than the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2, and (C) enforce their rights under the Debt Letters and (ii) satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis all the conditions to the Debt Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto that are in Parent’s (or its Affiliates’) control. In the event that all conditions set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived, and the Closing should otherwise occur pursuant to Section 2.2, Parent and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons providing the Debt Financing (the “Debt Financing Parties”) to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Letters and the definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing.   76








________________


(b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the Debt Financing and material developments with respect thereto as may reasonably be requested by the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) after obtaining Knowledge thereof, give the Company written notice of any (i) material breach or material default by Parent, its Affiliates, any Debt Financing Party or any other party to the Debt Letters or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing (or any event or circumstance, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would give rise to any such breach or default), (ii) receipt by Parent of any written notice of any threatened or actual withdrawal, repudiation, expiration or termination of the Debt Letters or the Debt Financing, (iii) material dispute or material disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Letters or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing (other than ordinary course negotiations related to the Debt Financing) that Parent in good faith believes may lead to a Financing Failure or (iv) if for any reason Parent in good faith no longer believes it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to consummate the Merger at the Effective Time. Parent may amend, supplement, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt Letters without the prior written approval of the Company; provided that Parent shall not, without the Company’s prior written consent, permit any such amendment, supplement, modification, termination, assignment or waiver to be made to, or consent to or agree to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the Debt Letters which would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount but excluding the exercise of any “flex” contemplated by the Debt Letters as in effect on the date hereof and any termination or reduction of the commitments in respect of any bridge facility pursuant to the express terms of the Debt Letters as in effect on the date hereof to the extent the amounts so terminated or reduced are replaced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the issuance of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in lieu thereof), (B) impose new or additional conditions to the Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Debt Financing or (C) otherwise expand, amend, supplement, modify, terminate, assign or waive any provision of the Debt Letters or Debt Financing, in a manner that in the case of clause (B) or clause (C) would reasonably be expected to (I) delay, prevent or make less likely the consummation of the Merger or the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) at the Closing, (II) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (III) adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to pay the Merger Amounts and provided, further, that the Debt Letters may be amended to add additional Debt Financing Parties who are not parties to the Debt Letters as of the date hereof. Parent shall not, without Company’s prior written consent, permit any such amendment, supplement, modification, termination, assignment or waiver to be made to, or consent to or agree to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the Equity Commitment Letter. In the event that new commitment letters or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, supplement, other modification, termination, replacement, assignment or waiver of the Financing Commitment Letters permitted pursuant to this Section 7.3, such new commitment letters or fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the “Equity Financing” or “Debt Financing”, as applicable, and deemed to be the “Equity Commitment Letter”, “Debt Commitment Letter”, “Fee Letter” and “Financing Commitment Letters”, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly after execution thereof (and in any event no later than one Business Day thereafter) deliver to the Company true, correct and complete copies of any amendment, supplement, other modification, termination, replacement, assignment or waiver of the Financing Commitment Letters. If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates, including any applicable financing affiliates, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event to, (x) notify the Company in writing thereof, (y) use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are not less favorable to Parent, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions as set forth in the Debt Letters, taking into account any “market flex” provisions thereof), including from alternative sources, in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Debt Financing that is available, to enable Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to pay the Merger Amounts (the “Substitute Debt Financing”) and (z) use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides for such Substitute Debt Financing and, promptly after execution thereof (and, in any event, no later than one Business Day thereafter), deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters (redacted in the same manner as permitted under Section 4.6(a)) and related Financing Documents with respect to such Substitute Debt Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute Debt Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the “Debt Financing” and any commitment letter and related fee letters for such Substitute Debt Financing shall be deemed the “Debt Commitment Letter”, “Fee Letter” and “Debt Letters”, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement. 


(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parent’s nor Merger Sub’s obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Equity Financing, Debt Financing, any Substitute Debt Financing or any other financing and (ii) the Company acknowledges and agrees that a breach of the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) shall not result in the failure of a condition precedent to the Company’s obligations under this Agreement if (notwithstanding such breach) Parent and Merger Sub are willing and able to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date.   77

________________


(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or Parent pursuant to (A) Section 9.1(b)(i) and at such time, (x) the only conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 that shall not have been satisfied or waived as of such time (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and are capable of being satisfied) are (1) the condition set forth in Section 8.1(b), or Section 8.1(c), (2) those conditions that shall not have been satisfied as a result of (I) any failure to obtain any clearance, approval or consent from any Governmental Authority of the PRC, in each case that is necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (II) any Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of any Governmental Authority of the PRC prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or (y) the Company could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(iii) or (B) Section 9.1(b)(ii) (with respect to (x) any Law or Order of any Governmental Authority of the PRC or (y) any Law or Order arising under any Competition Law), or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(iii), then, in each such case, Parent and the Company shall instruct the Escrow Agent, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to (x) pay to the Company, or Parent shall otherwise pay to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a fee in the amount of $171,100,000 (the “Parent Termination Fee”) as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days) following such termination and (y) return to Parent the remainder of the Escrow Amount (including any interest or income earned thereon) less any amount of monetary damages that the Company is seeking, and is permitted under this Agreement to seek, due to a Willful Breach of this Agreement by Parent.

No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by the Company of any Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the Company Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the Company’s representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

Section 10.8 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments referred to herein), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Escrow Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between Parent and the Company and among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof (provided that (x) any provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement conflicting with this Agreement shall be superseded by this Agreement and (y) all standstill or similar provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and no longer be in effect upon execution and delivery hereof) and (b) are not intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for the rights of the Company to pursue, on behalf of the holders of Company Stock and Company Awards, damages (including damages incurred or suffered by the holders of Company Stock and Company Awards in the event such holders would not receive the benefit of the bargain negotiated by the Company on their behalf as set forth in this Agreement) in the event of Parent’s, Shareholder’s or Merger Sub’s breach of this Agreement, the rights of the holders of Company Stock to, following the Effective Time, receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article II and the rights of the holders of Company Awards, following the Effective Time, to receive the consideration payable in accordance with Article II; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Effective Time, the provisions of Section 6.2 shall be enforceable by each Company Indemnified Party hereunder and his or her heirs or representatives; provided, further, that the Company shall be an express third-party beneficiary with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter; provided, further, that the Debt Financing Parties and each of their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees or representatives (each, a “Debt Financing Source Party”, collectively, the “Debt Financing Source Parties”) shall be express third-party beneficiaries with respect to Section 9.3(f)(ii), Section 10.2, this Section 10.8, Section 10.10 (third sentence), Section 10.12, Section 10.13(d), Section 10.14 and Section 10.15. 


Section 10.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 


Section 10.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub may collaterally assign their respective rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, (i) to any Debt Financing Party or (ii) assign their respective rights under this Agreement in connection with the mitigation of any withholding or deduction pursuant to Section 2.11; provided that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder.   95

Section 10.11 Guarantee. 


(a) Pearl 1 and Pearl 2 (the “Guarantors”) hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee, as primary obligors and not as surety, the due, prompt and full performance, payment and discharge when due of all of the covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement (including any payment obligations hereunder) in accordance with its express terms (such obligations, the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The Guaranteed Obligations are primary, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and such obligations shall continue in full force and effect until the payment and performance, as applicable, of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and are not conditioned upon any event or contingency or upon any attempt first to obtain payment or performance from Parent under this Agreement, or pursuit of any other right or remedy against Parent through the commencement of a Proceeding or otherwise. With respect to its obligations hereunder, the Guarantors expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent, and all suretyship defenses generally. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect, without notice from any other party in the event the obligations of Parent or the Guarantors under this Agreement are amended or in any way modified, and that the Guaranteed Obligations shall continue and shall apply in full to such amended obligations of Parent or the Guarantors as though the amended terms had been part of this Agreement from the original date of execution thereof. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the part of Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement; (iii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent; (iv) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent; (v) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which the Guarantors may have at any time against Parent, whether in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; or (vi) the adequacy of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment or performance related to the Guaranteed Obligations. 


Section 10.12 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise set forth in the Debt Letters as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, all matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Source Parties in any way relating to the Debt Letters or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing or in any definitive documentation related to the Debt Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.   96

Section 10.13 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction. 


(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the limitations in Section 9.3(f), the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the obligations to consummate the Merger, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if both the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal courts located in the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (including monetary damages). The Parties’ rights in this Section 10.13 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 10.13. 


(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 9.3(f), the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter and to make the payment of the Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts and to cause the Effective Time to occur and to consummate the Closing if, and only if, (i) the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or waived at the time when the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2 and (ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to the Parent that is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing; provided that the Company shall not be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to make the payment of the Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts and to cause the Effective Time to occur and to consummate the Closing if (A) the Marketing Period has ended, (B) the failure by Parent to make the payment of the Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts and to cause the Effective Time to occur and to consummate the Closing results from a Financing Failure and (C) Parent and Merger Sub are not in material breach of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. 


(c) In addition, each of the Parties (i) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if both the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal courts located in the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, (ii) consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (iv) consents to service of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 10.6.   97








________________


(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party agrees (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Source Parties in any way relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of the Debt Letters or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the County of New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom). 


Section 10.14 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE DEBT LETTERS, THE DEBT FINANCING, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT THERETO). 


Section 10.15 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any Party or any of their successors or permitted assigns or any direct or indirect director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general or limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative, successor or permitted assign of any of the foregoing (each, a “Non-Recourse Party”), shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any Party under this Agreement or for any claim or Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be an express third-party beneficiary with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter entitled to enforce its rights against the parties thereto in accordance with the terms thereof. Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce its rights, make any claims for breach, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates agrees that none of the Debt Financing Source Parties will have any liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates (in each case, other than Parent and Merger Sub), and hereby waives any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source Parties, in each case, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Letters, the Debt Financing, any of the agreements entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.15 shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of the Parent Parties and Merger Sub under this Agreement or any Debt Financing Source Party’s obligations to Parent, Merger Sub and, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under the Debt Letters, the Debt Financing or any of the agreements entered into in connection with the Debt Financing.

(b) Cancellation of Excluded Shares. Each TRMT Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time that is held by any wholly owned TRMT Subsidiary, by RMRM or by any wholly owned RMRM Subsidiary (such TRMT Common Shares, collectively, the “Excluded Shares”) shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time on the Closing Date, RMRM shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with a nationally recognized financial institution or trust company selected by RMRM and reasonably acceptable to TRMT to serve as the exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, (i) an aggregate number of duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable RMRM Common Shares to be issued in uncertificated or book-entry form comprising the number of RMRM Common Shares required to be issued pursuant to Section 3.1(a), and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash comprising a good faith estimate of the amount required to be delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(e).

Such RMRM Common Shares, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section








________________


3.2(e) and the amount of any dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the “Exchange Fund.” The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose provided for in this Agreement and shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, subject to Section 3.2(f). In the event that the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this Section 3.2, RMRM shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount sufficient to make such payments. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by RMRM or the Surviving Entity. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of RMRM and the Surviving Entity and shall be paid to RMRM or the Surviving Entity as RMRM directs. No investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall relieve RMRM, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this ARTICLE 3, and, following any losses from any such investment, RMRM shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy RMRM’s obligations hereunder for the benefit of each holder of record of Eligible Shares at the Merger Effective Time, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

(b) Exchange Procedures. (i) Promptly after the Merger Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail a notice to each holder of record of Eligible Shares that are evidenced by a TRMT Certificate advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including (A) appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to TRMT Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of TRMT Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of TRMT Certificates, as provided in Section 3.6) to the Exchange Agent, and (B) instructions for surrendering TRMT Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of TRMT Certificates, as provided in Section 3.6) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional RMRM Common Shares, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends or other distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional RMRM Common Shares, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions, in each case to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement with respect to TRMT Book-Entry Shares, shall be made promptly following the Merger Effective Time without any action on the part of the Person in whose name such TRMT Book-Entry Shares are registered. (ii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Eligible Shares, and any TRMT Certificate or ledger entry relating to TRMT Book-Entry Shares formerly representing TRMT Common Shares that have been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent. (iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of TRMT, the number of whole RMRM Common Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a), together with an amount (if any) of cash in immediately available funds or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after deducting any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.3 in lieu of fractional shares to be paid upon due surrender of the TRMT Certificate pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions in respect thereof in accordance with Section 3.2(c), may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the TRMT Certificate formerly representing such Eligible Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer and other similar Taxes have been paid, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Entity. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(b), each TRMT Certificate and TRMT Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time at or after the Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, any amount payable in cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.2(e), and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.2(c), in each case without interest. 


17 


(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is authorized by the RMRM Board and declared by RMRM in respect of RMRM Common Shares, the record date for which is after the Merger Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all RMRM Common Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. With respect to Eligible Shares represented by a TRMT Certificate, no dividends or other distributions in respect of RMRM Common Shares shall be paid to any holder of any such Eligible Share until the TRMT Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the TRMT Certificate as provided in Section 3.6) is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 3. Subject to applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole RMRM Common Shares issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Merger Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole RMRM Common Shares and not paid, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole RMRM Common Shares with a record date after the Merger Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. (d) Transfers. From and after the Merger Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the share transfer books of TRMT of the TRMT Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the holders of TRMT Certificates or TRMT Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such TRMT Common Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Merger Effective Time, TRMT Certificates or TRMT Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. (e) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional RMRM Common Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Any holder of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional RMRM Common Share but for this Section 3.2(e) shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of the applicable Eligible Shares, a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of any fractional share, in an amount rounded to the nearest whole cent equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which such holder (after taking into account all TRMT Common Shares held at the Merger Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the average of the closing price on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), as reported in The Wall Street Journal, for an RMRM Common Share for the five (5) consecutive full trading days ending on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. No holder of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional RMRM Common Shares described in this Section 3.2(e) to any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional RMRM Common Share. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional RMRM Common Shares is not a separately bargained- for consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Eligible Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to RMRM, upon demand, and any former holders of the TRMT Common Shares who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE 3 shall thereafter look only to RMRM for delivery of any RMRM Common Shares and any payment of cash and any dividends and other distributions in respect thereof payable or issuable pursuant to Section 3.1(a), Section 3.2(c) or Section 3.2(e), in each case, without any interest thereon and subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of TRMT Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of RMRM, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Section 3.3 Withholding Rights. Each Person making any payment or vesting any property pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts or property otherwise paid, distributed or vested (or portions thereof) as it determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or distribution, or vesting of such property, under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable Law. In the case of any noncash payment or distribution or the vesting of any property, the applicable withholding party may collect the amount required to be withheld by reducing to cash for remittance to the appropriate Governmental Authority a sufficient portion of the property that the recipient would otherwise receive or own (or already owns), if the cash portion of any such payment or distribution is not sufficient to cover the withholding liability, all on behalf of the recipient Person, and the recipient Person will bear any brokerage or other costs for this withholding procedure. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by any Person, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been distributed, paid or otherwise included in income to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. To the extent shares are reduced to cash to satisfy any withholding obligation, only a whole number of shares will be reduced to cash, and the Person in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made shall receive as of the Merger Effective Time the excess cash over the withholding obligation as a cash payment, without interest.

Section 3.4 Treatment of TRMT Equity Awards. To the extent not previously obtained, TRMT shall obtain (as soon as practicable following the date hereof and in any event prior to the Merger Effective Time) from each of TRMT’s executive officers and the other individuals set forth in Section 3.4 of the TRMT Disclosure Letter a waiver of such individual’s right to accelerated vesting of any unvested or partially vested TRMT Equity Awards held by such individual in connection with the Merger, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the “Waiver Form”) and shall, following the date hereof, use reasonable efforts to cause the vesting of any other unvested or partially vested TRMT Equity Awards held by each other holder thereof not to accelerate in connection with the consummation of the Merger by having the holder thereof execute the Waiver Form. At the Merger Effective Time, each unvested or partially vested TRMT Equity Award shall be converted into an award with respect to a number of RMRM Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (a) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (b) the number of TRMT Common Shares subject to such unvested or partially vested TRMT Equity Award at the Merger Effective Time. Such award shall continue to be subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, except as specifically set forth in the Waiver Form or as otherwise amended.

RMRM shall advise TRMT, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the registration or qualification of the RMRM Common Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and RMRM shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the TRMT Shareholder Approval or the RMRM Shareholder Approval, any information relating to TRMT or RMRM, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by TRMT or RMRM which, in the reasonable judgment of TRMT or RMRM, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party hereto, and TRMT and RMRM shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to holders of the TRMT Common Shares and holders of the RMRM Common Shares.

Nothing contained in this Agreement (absent termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms) shall be deemed to relieve TRMT of its obligation to submit the Merger and the other Transactions to which TRMT is a party to holders of the TRMT Common Shares for a vote on the approval thereof. TRMT agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, its obligations to hold the TRMT Shareholder Meeting pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall not be affected by an Adverse Recommendation Change or by any development, fact, circumstance or change that would give rise to a right of the TRMT Board or the RMRM Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change.

62 


(b) Each of the Parties will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.2, in confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the form of confidentiality agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A as if such Party was a “Recipient” as defined therein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 7.3(a), upon the unsolicited request of a third party, the Party receiving such request (the “Request Recipient”) may grant a waiver of a standstill, confidentiality, or similar obligation for the purpose of allowing a third party to make a confidential unsolicited Competing Proposal to the Request Recipient’s board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof) if contemporaneously with granting such waiver, the Request Recipient notifies the other Party of such waiver, such notice to be made orally and confirmed in writing, and of the identity of the Person(s) receiving such waiver. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.3(a) by any Representative of RMRM or TRMT or any of the RMRM Subsidiaries or the TRMT Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.3(a) by RMRM or TRMT, as applicable. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.3(b), if a Party or any RMRM Subsidiary or TRMT Subsidiary, as applicable, receives a written Competing Proposal (such Party, the “Proposal Recipient”) from any Person or group of Persons at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the RMRM Shareholder Approval or the TRMT Shareholder Approval, as applicable, that the Proposal Recipient’s board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Proposal Recipient’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, which Competing Proposal was received in circumstances not otherwise involving a material breach by the Proposal Recipient of this Section 7.3, the Proposal Recipient may, or may cause its Representatives to, in response to such Competing Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 7.3(c), (i) contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the Proposal Recipient and the RMRM Subsidiaries or the TRMT Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Competing Proposal, provided that the Proposal Recipient shall, prior to or concurrently with the time such information is provided to such Person or group of Persons, provide to the other Party any non-public information concerning the Proposal Recipient or any of the RMRM Subsidiaries or the TRMT Subsidiaries, as applicable, that is provided to any such Person or group of Persons which was not previously provided to the other Party or its Representatives, and (iii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal regarding such Competing Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.3(b) by any Representative of the Proposal Recipient, or any RMRM Subsidiary or TRMT Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.3(b) by the Proposal Recipient. 


63 


(c) The Proposal Recipient shall (i) promptly, and in any event no later than forty eight (48) hours after receipt of any Competing Proposal or request for non-public information in connection therewith, as applicable, advise the other Party in writing of the receipt of such Competing Proposal and any request for confidential information in connection with such Competing Proposal, the material terms of such Competing Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal or request for confidential information, and (ii) keep the other Party reasonably advised of all material developments affecting the terms (including all changes to the material terms) and status of such Competing Proposal, including the status of discussions or negotiations regarding such Competing Proposal.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.3(d), neither the RMRM Board (or an authorized committee thereof) nor the TRMT Board (or an authorized committee thereof) shall (i) (A) in the case of the RMRM Board (or an authorized committee thereof), fail to recommend to the holders of the RMRM Common Shares that the RMRM Shareholder Approval be given or fail to include the RMRM Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and, in the case of the TRMT Board (or an authorized committee thereof), fail to recommend to the holders of the TRMT Common Shares that the TRMT Shareholder Approval be given or fail to include the TRMT Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify the RMRM Board Recommendation (or the RMRM Special Committee’s recommendation to the RMRM Board with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions) or the TRMT Board Recommendation (or the TRMT Special Committee’s recommendation to the TRMT Board with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions), as applicable, in each case in a manner adverse to the other Party, or (C) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, a Competing Proposal (actions described in this clause (i) being referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit RMRM or TRMT, as applicable, or any of the RMRM Subsidiaries or the TRMT Subsidiaries, as applicable, to enter into any Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the RMRM Shareholder Approval, in the case of RMRM, or the TRMT Shareholder Approval, in the case of TRMT, is obtained, and subject to material compliance with this Section 7.3(d) and Sections 7.3(a)-(c), the RMRM Board (or an authorized committee thereof) or the TRMT Board (or an authorized committee thereof), as applicable, may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii), in the case of RMRM, if (A) (1) a written Competing Proposal is received by it and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn, and (2) prior to taking such action, the Proposal Recipient’s board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof), has determined in good faith after consultation with the Proposal Recipient’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, or (B) an Intervening Event occurs with respect to RMRM or TRMT and the RMRM Board (or an authorized committee thereof) or the TRMT Board (or an authorized committee thereof), as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with their trustees’ duties under applicable Law of the State of Maryland; provided, however, that the RMRM Board (or an authorized committee thereof) or the TRMT Board (or an authorized committee thereof), as applicable, may not take any action contemplated by clause (A) or (B) of this sentence unless: 


64 


(1) if such action is taken in connection with any such Competing Proposal, (a) the Proposal Recipient has given the other Party at least three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall include the information with respect to such Competing Proposal that is specified in Section 7.3(c) as well as a copy of any proposal and any then existing drafts of the definitive agreement and other material documentation providing for such Competing Proposal), (b) the Proposal Recipient has negotiated in good faith with the other Party, to the extent the other Party wishes to negotiate, during such notice period to enable the other Party to propose in writing revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute (in the good faith determination of the board of trustees of the Proposal Recipient (or an authorized committee thereof) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors) a Superior Proposal, (c) following the end of such notice period, the Proposal Recipient’s board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof) shall have considered in good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by the other Party and shall have determined that, after consultation with the Proposal Recipient’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect, and (d) in the event of any change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Proposal Recipient shall, in each case, have delivered to the other Party an additional notice consistent with that described in subclause (a) above and the notice period shall have recommenced, except that the notice period shall be at least one (1) Business Day; and (2) if such action is taken in connection with any such Intervening Event, (x) RMRM or TRMT, as applicable, has given the other Party at least three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall include in reasonable detail the basis for such action), (y) such Party has negotiated in good faith with the other Party, to the extent the other Party wishes to negotiate, during such notice period to enable the other Party to propose in writing revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with their trustees’ duties under applicable Law of the State of Maryland, and (z) following the end of such notice period, the RMRM Board (or an authorized committee thereof) or the TRMT Board (or an authorized committee thereof), as applicable, shall have considered in good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by the other Party and shall have determined that, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with their trustees’ duties under applicable Law of the State of Maryland if such revisions were to be given effect. 


65 


(e) Except to the extent provided in Section 7.3(c) or Section 7.3(d), nothing in this Section 7.3 shall prohibit the RMRM Board (or an authorized committee thereof) or the TRMT Board (or an authorized committee thereof) from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or otherwise complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to a Competing Proposal; provided that, if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the RMRM Board Recommendation or the TRMT Board Recommendation, as applicable, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the RMRM Board shall not be required to submit this Agreement to the holders of the RMRM Common Shares if the RMRM Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change permitted by this Section 7.3, and the RMRM Board may submit to the holders of RMRM Common Shares, any Competing Proposal. (f) As used in this Agreement, a “Competing Proposal” means any proposal or offer from any Person (other than any Party) or “group”, within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, to a Party relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any direct or indirect (i) acquisition or purchase of twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries) of such Party (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the board of trustees of such Party (or an authorized committee thereof) as applicable, after consultation with such Party’s outside financial advisors and independent accountants), as applicable, or assets comprising twenty percent (20%) or more of the revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis of such Party, (ii) acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding equity securities of such Party or any class of equity securities of such Party, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity securities of such Party, (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving such Party or any RMRM Subsidiary or TRMT Subsidiary, as applicable, that comprise twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets, revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis of such Party, as applicable, or (v) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions, if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and any class of equity securities of such Party involved is twenty percent (20%) or more.

(g) As used in this Agreement, a “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Competing Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of “Competing Proposal” to “twenty percent (20%)” shall be replaced by “seventy-five percent (75%)”) made by a Person or “group”, within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, on terms that the Proposal Recipient’s board of trustees (or an authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Proposal Recipient’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account all relevant financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of such proposal that the Proposal Recipient’s board of trustees (or such committee) deems relevant, including the identity of the Person making such proposal, financing terms and conditions to consummation, as well as any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Party in response to such proposal or otherwise, (i) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the holders of the Proposal Recipient’s equity interests (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) for which the third party has demonstrated that the financing for such offer is fully committed or is reasonably likely to be obtained, and (iii) is reasonably likely to receive all required approvals from any Governmental Authority and otherwise reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed. Section 7.4 Public Announcements. The initial press releases and initial investor presentations with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be reasonably agreed upon by RMRM and TRMT. Except with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance with Section 7.3, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the Parties hereto shall, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances, consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions and provide such Party with an opportunity to review and comment upon such press release or other public announcement or filing, which comments the other Party shall consider in good faith; provided, that a Party may, without consulting with or pursuing the other Party’s review, issue such press release or make such public statement or filing with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of Nasdaq. Section 7.5 Indemnification; Trustees’, Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. (a) From and after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall honor and comply with, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law, the obligations of TRMT with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation and related matters, under the TRMT Governing Documents in effect on the date hereof and under any indemnification or other similar agreements in effect on the date hereof (the “Indemnification Agreements”) to individuals who at or prior to the Merger Effective Time were officers, trustees, directors or agents of TRMT or a TRMT Subsidiary and covered by such TRMT Governing Documents or Indemnification Agreements (the “Covered Persons”) arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, including, but not limited to, in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions. 


67 


(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 7.5(a), for a period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Covered Person’s capacity as such, or (B) this Agreement, the Merger and any of the other Transactions; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) of any Covered Person upon receipt of an undertaking, substantially in the form of that required under the Indemnification Agreements or in such other form as may be required by applicable Law as in effect at such time, by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined by order of a court, regulatory authority or authorized adjudicating body that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement, (x) the Surviving Entity shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit or proceeding against or investigation of a Covered Person for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 7.5(b) without the Covered Person’s prior written consent unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such Covered Person from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (y) the Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, and (z) the Surviving Entity shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Covered Person to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Covered Person shall promptly refund to the Surviving Entity the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto. (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, (i) the declaration of trust and bylaws of the Surviving Entity shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior to and including the Merger Effective Time than are currently set forth in the TRMT Governing Documents; and (ii) the Surviving Entity shall (A) except to the extent such agreement provides for an earlier termination, cause to be maintained in effect the provisions regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses in any other agreements of TRMT or the TRMT Subsidiaries with any Covered Persons that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and (B) not amend, modify or repeal such provisions in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Covered Person in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Merger Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions). (d) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, TRMT shall, in consultation with RMRM, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancelable extension of coverage afforded by TRMT’s existing directors and officers liability insurance policies (the “D&O Insurance”), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Merger Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Merger Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as TRMT’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions and retentions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under TRMT’s existing policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have been provided to RMRM prior to the date hereof) and with limits of liability that are no lower than the limits on TRMT’s existing policies so long as the premium in the aggregate does not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual aggregate premium(s) under TRMT’s existing policies; provided, that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, TRMT, in consultation with RMRM, shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to facts, acts, events or omissions occurring prior to the Merger Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. 


68 


(e) In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the

continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity, as applicable, or such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Section 9.2, (i) if RMRM receives the TRMT Termination Fee from TRMT pursuant to this Section 9.3, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of RMRM against TRMT and the TRMT Subsidiaries, and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, trustees, partners, shareholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, the “TRMT Parties”) and no TRMT Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if TRMT receives the RMRM Termination Fee from RMRM pursuant to this Section 9.3, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of TRMT against RMRM and the RMRM Subsidiaries, and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, trustees, partners, shareholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, the “RMRM Parties”) and no RMRM Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) If TRMT becomes obligated to pay the TRMT Termination Fee under this Section 9.3, then, if requested by RMRM, TRMT shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the TRMT Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by RMRM that is reasonably acceptable to RMRM pursuant to a written escrow agreement (the “RMRM Escrow Agreement”) reflecting the terms set forth in this Section 9.3(d) and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the escrow agent. The RMRM Escrow Agreement shall provide that the TRMT Termination Fee in escrow or the applicable portion thereof shall be released to RMRM on an annual basis based upon the delivery by RMRM to the escrow agent of any one (or a combination) of the following: (i) a letter from RMRM’s independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to RMRM without causing RMRM to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable taxable year of RMRM, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(I) or 856(c)(3) (A)-(I) of the Code (such income, “Qualifying REIT Income”), in which case the escrow agent shall release to RMRM such maximum amount stated in the accountants’ letter; (ii) a letter from RMRM’s counsel indicating that RMRM received a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by RMRM of the TRMT Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to RMRM the remainder of the TRMT Termination Fee; or (iii) a letter from RMRM’s counsel indicating that RMRM has received a tax opinion from RMRM REIT Tax Counsel to the effect that the receipt by RMRM of the TRMT Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to RMRM the remainder of the TRMT Termination Fee. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to amend this Section 9.3(d) at the reasonable request of RMRM in order to (A) maximize the portion of the applicable TRMT Termination Fee that may be distributed to RMRM hereunder without causing RMRM to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B) improve RMRM’s chances of securing the favorable private letter ruling from the IRS described in this Section 9.3(d) or (C) assist RMRM in obtaining the favorable tax opinion from RMRM REIT Tax Counsel described in this Section 9.3(d), provided that any such amendment shall not cause any cash to be released from escrow without satisfaction of condition (i), (ii) or (iii) in the preceding sentence. The RMRM Escrow Agreement shall provide that RMRM shall bear all costs and expenses under the RMRM Escrow Agreement. TRMT shall not be a party to the RMRM Escrow Agreement and shall not bear any liability, cost or expense resulting directly or indirectly from the Escrow Agreement. (e) If RMRM becomes obligated to pay the RMRM Termination Fee under this Section 9.3, then, if requested by TRMT, RMRM shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the RMRM Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by TRMT that is reasonably acceptable to TRMT pursuant to a written escrow agreement (the “TRMT Escrow Agreement”) reflecting the terms set forth in this Section 9.3(e) and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the escrow agent. The TRMT Escrow Agreement shall provide that the RMRM Termination Fee in escrow or the applicable portion thereof shall be released to TRMT on an annual basis based upon the delivery by TRMT to the escrow agent of any one (or a combination) of the following: (i) a letter from TRMT’s independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to TRMT without causing TRMT to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable taxable year of TRMT, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying REIT Income, in which case the escrow agent shall release to TRMT such maximum amount stated in the accountants’ letter; (ii) a letter from TRMT’s counsel indicating that TRMT received a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by TRMT of the RMRM Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income

Section 10.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that jurisdiction, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger or the other Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party, and (d) such terms or other provisions shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger or the other Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Section 10.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall be deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered (by electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other Party. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in .pdf format, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature. Section 10.5 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. (a) This Agreement (including the TRMT Disclosure Letter, the RMRM Disclosure Letter, the exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein), together with the TRA Letter Agreement, the TRA Voting Agreement and the DP Voting Agreement, constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. (b) This Agreement is intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for Section 7.5 (which, from and after the Merger Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Covered Persons). The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties other than as described in this Section 10.5. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 10.7 without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of RMRM or Knowledge of TRMT, as applicable. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 10.6 Amendment and Modification. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any respect by mutual written agreement of the Parties at any time before or after receipt of the TRMT Shareholder Approval or the RMRM Shareholder Approval and prior to the Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that after the TRMT Shareholder Approval or the RMRM Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment, modification or supplement of this Agreement, which by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq requires the further approval of the holders of the TRMT Common Shares or the holders of the RMRM Common Shares, without such further approval of such shareholders. Section 10.7 Extension and Waiver. At any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, any Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by TRMT or RMRM in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Section 10.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. (a) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law principles (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland. (b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Maryland state or federal court. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Maryland state or federal court, for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party, (ii) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (iii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any Maryland state or federal court, (iv) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding, and (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

Section 10.9 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE OTHER AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 10.9. Section 10.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party and any attempt to

make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. Section 10.11 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE 9, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereby waives (a) any defense in an Action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate, and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a security as prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Each Party agrees that the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the Merger and the other Transactions, and without that right, neither TRMT, on the one hand, nor RMRM, on the other hand, would have entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other equitable remedies to the extent permitted by this Section 10.11 and the payment of damages, but shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of damages if specific performance or other equitable remedies are awarded and consummation of the Merger occurs and shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of specific performance or other equitable remedies if damages are awarded. Section 10.12 Non-liability of Trustees of TRMT and RMRM. The TRMT Charter, the RMRM Charter, and the RMRM Post-Merger Charter provide that no trustee, officer, shareholder, employee or agent of TRMT or RMRM, respectively, shall be held to any personal liability, jointly or severally, for any obligation of, or claim against, TRMT or RMRM, respectively. All Persons dealing with TRMT or RMRM in any way shall look only to the assets of TRMT or RMRM, respectively, for the payment of any sum or the performance of any obligation.

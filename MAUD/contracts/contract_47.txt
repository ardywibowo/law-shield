  1.6           Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the By-laws. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the By-laws.   ARTICLE II   Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock   2.1           Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company:   (a)           Merger Consideration. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (a “Share” or, collectively, the “Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $48.25 per Share in cash (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), without any interest thereon. At the Effective Time, each Share converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration without interest thereon shall automatically cease to exist and the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time not represented by certificates (“Book-Entry Shares”) and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represent Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (the “Certificates”) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2(a), the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such Share held by them. The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Shares exchanged theretofore and represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.   (b)           Cancellation of Excluded Shares.

  (d)           Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who has demanded and perfected such holder’s right to appraisal of such Shares in accordance with Section262 of the DGCL (the “ Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but such holder will be entitled to such rights as afforded under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section262 with respect to such Dissenting Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to retain any of the Per Share Merger Consideration not paid on account of the Dissenting Shares pending resolution of the claims of such holders, and the remaining holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to any portion thereof. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal right with respect to such Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration for such Shares, and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly provide cash to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares at the Effective Time in an amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be deemed Dissenting Shares under this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of receiving any written demands for appraisal of Shares, withdrawals or such demands, or any other instruments served on the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by Law, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, offer to settle or settle, any such written demands.   2.2           Exchange of Certificates.   (a)           Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer& Trust Company, as paying agent hereunder (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) at the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 2.1(a)(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that such investments shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 2.1(a)shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any of the holders of Shares at the Effective Time to receive the payments as provided herein. To the extent that there are losses with respect to any such investments or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment under Section 2.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace, restore or increase the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments under Section 2.1(a).

  (b)          Exchange Procedures.   (i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or electronically provide to each holder of record, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i)a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration.   (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such duly executed letter of transmittal the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to (x)the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book- Entry Shares multiplied by (y)the Per Share Merger Consideration, and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

The parties will cooperate in good faith to obtain any available exemption or reduction of such withholding.   2.6           Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest in the Surviving Corporation the full right and title of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.   ARTICLE III   Representations and Warranties

Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, as of the date of this Agreement, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Except as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments, other than the Financing Commitments, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no written agreements or side letters relating to the conditionality, funding or investing, as applicable, of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing, and the Financing Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent or Merger Sub (as applicable) on the terms therein. No event has occurred as of the date of this Agreement which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (i) constitute a default or breach of Parent or Merger Sub, or to the Knowledge of Parent, of any other party thereto, under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments; or (ii)to the knowledge of Parent, otherwise result in or would reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the Financing not being available by the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Investors nor any Lender has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate any of the Financing Commitments or not to provide the Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it with respect to the Financing Commitments or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available as of the Closing. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments (or any related fee letter or engagement letter) to be paid as of the date of this Agreement. None of the Financing Commitments (or any related fee letter or engagement letter) contains any commitment fee or other fee payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates prior to Closing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing required to be provided by Parent to pay the aggregate Merger consideration contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2), all costs, fees and expenses and all other amounts (including refinancing or repayment of any debt) required to be paid by Parent on the Closing Date to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the “Required Financing Amount”). As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has been withdrawn and, assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, Parent does not know of any facts or circumstances that would result in or would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied or any portion of the Financing not being available. Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that, except as set forth in Section 7.6, its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereunder is not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to financing.

  (f)            Capitalization of Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 100shares of common stock, par value $0.01per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (g)           Brokers and Finders. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finder’s fees in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement, except that Parent has employed Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as its financial advisor.

  (h)           Solvency. Assuming (i)satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and payment of all related fees and expenses and (ii) the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Solvent” when used with respect any Person means that, immediately following the Effective Time, (i)(A)the fair value of the assets of such Person will exceed the amount of all liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of such Person, and (B)the amount of the Present Fair Salable Value of its assets will, as of such time, exceed the probable value of all of its debts and liabilities on a consolidated basis, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured, (ii)the Person will not have, as of such time, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged and (iii)the Person will be able to pay its Debts as they become absolute and mature. The term “Solvency” shall have its correlative meaning. For purposes of the definition of “Solvent”: (A) “Debt” means liability on a Claim; and (B)“ Claim” means any right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. “Present Fair Salable Value” means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the Person (including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises. For purposes of this definition, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged” and “able to pay its Debts as they become absolute and mature” means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. No transfer is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.   (i)            Ownership of Company Capital Stock. Other than as a result of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is, or at any time during the last three (3)years has been, an “interested stockholder” (as defined in Section203 of the DGCL) of the Company. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates beneficially owns (as such term is used under Rule13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or has at any time during the last three (3)years beneficially owned, any Shares or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Shares or other securities of, or any economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company.   (j)            Proxy Statement. None of the information to be supplied in writing by Parent, Merger Sub or any Representative of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, if any, will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties in this Section5.05 do not apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based upon information supplied by the Company or any of its Representatives in writing specifically for use or incorporation by reference therein.   


36    


  (k)           Stockholder and Management Arrangements. As of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates has entered into any Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or other understanding (whether or not binding) with any stockholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in their capacities as such) (i)relating to (A)this Agreement; (B)the Company or (C)the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment) from and after the Effective Time; or (ii)pursuant to which (A)any holder of shares of Common Stock of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of such holder’s shares of Common Stock of the Company; or (B)any holder of shares of Common Stock of the Company has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote against any Superior Proposal, in each case, that is currently in effect or that would become effective in the future (upon consummation of the Merger or otherwise) and that has not been disclosed.   (l)            Investment Intention. Parent, through Merger Sub, is acquiring through the Merger the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view of the distribution (as such term is used in Section2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof in violation of the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub understand that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have not been registered under the Securities Act or any “blue sky” Laws and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act, any applicable “blue sky” Laws or pursuant to an exemption from any such registration.   (m)          Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Guarantor has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantee. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default on the part of Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.   ARTICLE IV   Covenants   4.1           Interim Operations. (a)The Company covenants and agrees as to itself and its Subsidiaries that, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VI (except: (i)if Parent shall otherwise approve in writing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii)as otherwise expressly required by this Agreement, (iii)as expressly set forth in Section 4.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (iv)as required by applicable Laws or any Governmental Entity or (v)with respect to any COVID-19 Measures to the extent reasonably necessary for the operation of the Company), the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be conducted, in all material respects, in the ordinary course of business (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consistent with recent past practice in light of COVID-19) and applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in furtherance thereof, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VI, except (A) as otherwise contemplated or required by this Agreement, (B) as Parent may approve in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (C)as required by applicable Laws or any Governmental Entity or (D) as set forth in Section 4.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company will not, and will not permit its Subsidiaries, to:   (i) adopt any amendments to its charter or by-laws or other applicable governing instruments;

in a separate “clean data room” and subject to customary “clean team” arrangements regarding access to such information or data, (ii)contact a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or (iii)engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, in each case if and only to the extent that, prior to taking any action described in clause (c)(i) or (c)(iii)above, (A)the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Financial Advisor, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B)the Company Board has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means an executed confidentiality agreement with terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to and not less restrictive in any material respect than in the Confidentiality Agreement which agreement shall not restrict the Company from complying with its obligations under this Agreement.   (d)           Except as provided in Sections 4.2(e)and 4.2(g), the Company Board shall not (i)withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal (a “Change of Recommendation”), (ii)cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to result in, any Acquisition Proposal (each, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”), (iii)adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (iv)fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (v)fail to expressly reaffirm publicly the Company Recommendation within ten (10)Business Days following Parent’s written request to do so if an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or disclosed.

  (e)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (including Section 4.2(d)) , at any time prior to the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after the date of this Agreement that is not preceded by a breach of Section 4.2, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Financial Advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may (i)make a Change of Recommendation and/or (ii)terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement) with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided that prior to taking any such action, (x)the Company has given Parent five (5)Business Days’ notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall state that it has received a Superior Proposal, include the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, the consideration offered therein, the identity of the Person or group (as defined in or under Section13(d)of the Exchange Act) making the Superior Proposal and, a copy of the definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all related material documentation relating to such Superior Proposal and, subject to customary redactions (to the extent provided to the Company in redacted form), a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto), (y)the Company and its Representatives has negotiated in good faith (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) with Parent during such notice period to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that the Company Board would no longer determine that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3(a), as applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (z)following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby proposed in writing by Parent and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Financial Advisor, that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect and that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3(a), as applicable, would continue to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (provided further that any material amendment to the financial terms of the Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and shall require the Company to further comply with the requirements of the proviso of this Section 4.2(d), except that the notice period shall be three (3) Business Days, not five (5) Business Days).   (f)            The Company agrees that it will promptly, and in any event within twenty-four hours, notify Parent in writing if any inquiries, proposals, offers or indications of interest with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of such Person and the material terms and conditions thereof and a copy of any such inquiry, proposal or offer or indication of interest and any draft agreement or other material documents provided in connection therewith. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such inquiry, request for information, proposal, offer or indication of interest (including by notifying Parent in writing of any amendments or material changes to the terms thereto within twenty- four hours) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Company’s intentions as previously notified.

  (g)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company Board may make a Change of Recommendation for a reason unrelated to a Superior Proposal if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, (I)an Intervening Event occurred and (II)the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law as a result of the Intervening Event; provided that prior to taking any such action, (x)the Company has given Parent four (4)Business Days’ notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonably detailed description of such circumstances giving rise to such Intervening Event that serves as the basis of the Change of Recommendation, (y)the Company has negotiated in good faith (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) with Parent during such notice period to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby such that it would obviate the need for making such Change of Recommendation as the failure to do so would no longer be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (z)following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby proposed in writing by Parent and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law if the proposed revisions were to be given effect (provided further that any material amendment to facts and circumstances relating to the Intervening Event shall require a new notice and shall require the Company to further comply with the requirements of the proviso of this Section 4.2(f), except that the notice period shall be three (3) Business Days, not five (5) Business Days).   (h)           Nothing contained in this Section 4.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i)complying with its

Further for the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 7.6, if all or any portion of the Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained, Parent shall continue to be obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and effect the Closing on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2.   (d)           If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under Section 4.15(a), any of the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason, or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and subject to the conditions (including any “flex” provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall (i)promptly notify the Company of such unavailability, expiration or termination and the reasons therefor, (ii)as promptly as practicable use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for alternative debt financing (the “Alternative Financing”) (which alternative debt financing shall be in an amount sufficient, when added with the Equity Financing, to pay the Required Financing Amount at Closing and shall not include any conditions that are more onerous than or in addition to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement), to be consummated no later than the day on which the Closing shall occur pursuant to Section 1.2, (iii)provide to the Company copies of all documents (including all fee letters and engagement letters but excluding provisions thereof related to fees, pricing, market flex provisions, customary threshold amounts and any other provisions as reasonably required by the lenders party thereto, which may be redacted so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the aggregate principal amount committed thereunder) relating to any alternative financing to replace the Debt Financing and (iv)keep the Company reasonably informed of material developments in respect of the process of obtaining any alternative financing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.15(a)through Section 4.15(d), it is understood and agreed that in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent and its Affiliates be deemed or construed to require Parent or any of its Affiliates to pay any fees materially in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including market flex provisions set forth therein) as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or agree to any market flex provision materially less favorable to the Buyer than the market flex provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise). None of such Sections 4.15(a)through Section 4.15(d)shall require Parent or its Affiliates to provide, or cause to be provided, any information or take, or cause to be taken, any action to the extent it would result in a material violation of material, applicable Law, or provide any information to any Person that would result in (x)a violation of any confidentiality obligation contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or (y) loss of any attorney-client privilege.

The Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parent shall not need to prove damages to receive the Company Termination Fee when it is payable under this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably waives any right to challenge the amount of actual damages represented by the Company Termination Fee. In no event shall Parent be entitled to the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b) The REIT Merger shall be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement shall be, and hereby is, adopted as a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

If Parent provides such written notice, the following changes to the transactions contemplated in this Article II to occur at the Closing will be made: 


(a) In lieu of the merger of the REIT Surviving Entity with and into the Company LP, in the “Partnership Merger” Parent OP will merge with and into Company LP, and Company LP shall be the surviving entity and shall be considered the “Partnership Surviving Entity”.

Company Share Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Share Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.9) or transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Company Share Certificates or the transfer of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the REIT Per Share Merger Consideration. 


(f) Upon surrender of a Company Share Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.9) or transfer of any Book-Entry Share for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a Company Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and in respect of each share represented by such Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the REIT Per Share Merger Consideration into which each such share has been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any dividends or other distributions to which such Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share become entitled in accordance with Section 3.7(g) or Section 3.10, and the Company Share Certificate so surrendered and Book-Entry Share so transferred shall be cancelled.

No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

Parent’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent’s disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation.

Mercury and each Mercury Party is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing (or the equivalent thereof, if applicable with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction where the character of any of its properties or other assets owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except, in each case, for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. There are no current dissolution, revocation or forfeiture proceedings against Mercury. 


Section 6.2 Authority. Mercury has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Mercury and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which any Mercury Party is a party have been duly and validly authorized by Mercury and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Mercury are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Mergers or to consummate the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to (i) with respect to the REIT Merger, the filing of the REIT Certificate of Merger with the Delaware SOS, and (ii) with respect to the Partnership Merger, the filing of the Partnership Merger Certificate of Merger with the Delaware SOS.

instrument, indenture, contract, agreement, ground lease, license, permit or other legally binding obligation to which any Mercury Party is a party, except, as to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 


(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Mercury does not, and the performance of this Agreement by Mercury will not, require any consent, approval, waiting period expiration or termination, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority by any Mercury Party except (i) the filing with the SEC of such reports under, and other compliance with, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any filings required by any state securities or “blue sky” Laws, (iii) any filings required under the rules and regulations of the NYSE, (iv) the Gaming Approvals and (v) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

outcome to any finding of suitability proceedings currently pending, or any application or proceeding for the Gaming Approvals necessary for the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except where such negative outcome would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the ability of Mercury and the Mercury Parties to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Mercury Licensed Party or, to the Mercury Licensed Parties’ knowledge, Mercury Related Parties, has received notice of any proceeding or review by any Governmental Authority under any Gaming Law with respect to any Mercury Licensed Party or, to the Mercury Licensed Parties’ knowledge, any other Mercury Related Party that would reasonably be expected to result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability proceedings currently pending, or any application or proceeding for the Gaming Approvals necessary for the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the Mercury Licensed Parties’ knowledge, with respect to the Mercury Licensed Parties and the Mercury Related Parties only, there are no facts, which if known to the Gaming Authorities, will or would reasonably be expected to (i) result in the denial, revocation, limitation or suspension of any license currently held under the Gaming Laws, or (ii) result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability proceedings currently pending, or any application or proceeding for the Gaming Approvals necessary for the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), where such denial, revocation, limitation or suspension or negative outcome would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the ability of the Mercury Licensed Parties to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Mercury Licensed Parties nor any Mercury Related Party has suffered a suspension or revocation of any license held under the Gaming Laws necessary to conduct the business and operations of the Mercury Licensed Parties in each of the jurisdictions in which the Mercury Licensed Parties own or operate gaming facilities.

(a) From the REIT Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the REIT Merger Effective Time, without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, employee, or agent may have under any indemnification agreement or under the Company Organizational Documents or the organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof, the Parent Parties shall, jointly and severally: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or during the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date, serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company Parties or any of their Subsidiaries and acting in such capacity (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such Claim; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of, or, after any request for advancement, advance, to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to the Parent Parties’ receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified; provided, that the Parent Parties shall not be liable for any amounts paid in settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably   105

conditioned, withheld or delayed) and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim (except to the extent the Indemnified Party is advised by counsel that such Indemnified Party has conflicting interests with one or more other Indemnified Parties in the outcome of such action (in which event such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to engage separate counsel, the fees and expenses for which the Parent Parties shall be liable)). The indemnification and advancement obligations of the Parent Parties pursuant to this Section 8.7(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Closing and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company Parties or their Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such Person’s heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this Section 8.7(a), (A) the term “Claim” means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, whether instituted by any Party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to, or that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any Action arising out of or pertaining to (x) matters that relate to such Indemnified Party’s duties or service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company Parties and their Subsidiaries or, to the extent such Person is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of the Company Parties and their Subsidiaries, any other entity or any Company Benefit Plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Closing, and (y) this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (B) the term “Claim Expenses” means reasonable attorneys’ fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts’ fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section 8.7(a), including any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. The Parent Parties shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 


(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each Parent Party agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in Company Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements of the Company Parties and their Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, the organizational documents of the REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving Entity shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and limitations on liability of trustees, directors, officers or agents than as set forth in the Company Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries.   106

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Parent Parties shall maintain in effect the Company Parties’ and their Subsidiaries’ current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to and through the Closing; provided, that in lieu of such obligation, (i) the Parent Parties may substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the same or better rating as the Company Parties’ or its Subsidiaries’ insurance carrier the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than the Company Parties’ or their Subsidiaries’ existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) the Company may obtain (at Parent’s sole cost and expense) extended reporting period coverage under the Company Parties’ or the Company’s Subsidiaries’ existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Closing) or purchase a “tail” policy for a period of six (6) years after the Closing; provided further, that in no event shall the Parent Parties be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this Section 8.7(c) in excess of 300% of the most recent annual premiums paid by the Company Party or its Subsidiary, as applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement for such purpose, it being understood that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Parent Party or its Subsidiary, as applicable, shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount. 


(d) If a Parent Party or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Parent Party, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.7. 


(e) The Parent Parties shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 8.7; provided, that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law. 


(f) The provisions of this Section 8.7 are intended to be for the express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.7), his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company Parties and the Parent Parties and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this Section 8.7 shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.   107

intentional breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination of this Agreement, in which case the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity. For purposes of this Agreement, “willful and intentional breach” means a material breach that is a consequence of an act knowingly undertaken by the breaching Party with the intent of causing a breach of this Agreement (it being understood that the failure of the Company or the Company LP, on the one hand, or Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Parent OP, on the other hand, to consummate the Mergers when required under the terms of this Agreement will constitute a willful and intentional breach).

Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 10.3(c)(ii). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the case of fraud or intentional and willful misconduct as expressly provided below, in the event that the Parent Termination Fee becomes payable, then payment to the Company of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages of any nature against the Parent Parties or Parent Subsidiaries and each of their respective former, current and future trustees, directors, officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future trustee, director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, shareholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Collective Parent Parties”) in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Mergers to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such Parent Termination Fee no Collective Parent Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that none of Parent, REIT Merger Sub, or Parent OP shall be relieved from any liability or damages resulting from any fraud in connection with this Agreement or any willful and intentional breach (as defined in Section 10.2 above) of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination of this Agreement. 


(d) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other Party would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to this Section 10.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company or Parent for the amounts set forth in this Section 10.3, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, as applicable, its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 10.3 from the date of termination of this Agreement at the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 1%. 


(e) The “Company Termination Fee” shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $421,000,000 (the “Company Base Amount”) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (“Qualifying Income), and (b) Parent has 1% of its gross income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of Parent which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants engaged by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that Parent’s receipt of the Company Base Amount should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Company Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Company Base Amount and the Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent has received   136

the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Company Base Amount within five (5) Business Days. In the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Company Base Amount due to the above limitations, subject to Parent’s prior delivery to the Company of the Parent Tax Accrual Opinion (as defined below) with respect to such escrow, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow (the “Company Termination Fee Escrow”) by wire transfer within three (3) days of the date when the Company Termination Fee would otherwise be due but for the above limitations and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives either one or a combination of the following once or more often: (i) a letter from Parent’s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events the Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Company Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in clause (i) above within five (5) Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof. The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Company Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years from the date the Company Termination Fee first becomes payable under Section 10.3(b). Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee terminates shall be released to the Company. The “Parent Tax Accrual Opinion” means an opinion of nationally recognized federal income tax counsel experienced in REIT Tax matters based on then applicable law and complying with the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.856-7(c)(2) to the effect that the deposit into the Company Termination Fee Escrow, as applicable, should not cause Parent to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any Parent taxable year in excess of the amount released from such escrow to Parent in such taxable year. 


(f) The “Parent Termination Fee” shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $709,000,000 (the “Parent Base Amount”) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the “REIT Requirements”) for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (b) the Company has 1% of its gross income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of the Company which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants engaged by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company receives Tax Guidance providing that the Company’s receipt of the Parent Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Parent Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Parent Base Amount and Parent shall, upon receiving notice that the Company has received the Tax Guidance, pay to the Company the unpaid Parent Base Amount within five (5) Business Days. In the event that the Company is not able to receive the full Parent Base Amount due to the above limitations, Parent shall place the unpaid amount in escrow (the “Parent Termination Fee Escrow”) by wire transfer within three (3) days of the date when the Parent Termination Fee would otherwise be due but for the above limitations and shall not release any portion thereof to the Company unless and until the Company receives either one or a combination of the following once or more often: (i) subject to the Company’s prior delivery to Parent of the Company Tax Accrual Opinion (as defined below) with respect to such escrow, a letter from the Company’s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events   137

Parent shall pay to the Company the lesser of the unpaid Parent Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in clause (i) above within five (5) Business Days after Parent has been notified thereof. The obligation of Parent to pay any unpaid portion of the Parent Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years from the date the Parent Termination Fee first becomes payable under Section 10.3(c).

Section 11.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that jurisdiction, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party, and (d) such terms or other provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 


Section 11.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall be deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered (by electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in .pdf format, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for the provisions of Article III (which, from and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time and REIT Merger Effective Time, as applicable, shall be for the benefit of holders of the Company Partnership Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time or the holders of the   140

Company Class A Shares immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, as applicable), and Section 8.7 (which, from and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time and the REIT Merger Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties); provided that the Debt Financing Sources are intended third party beneficiaries as set forth in Section 11.12. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties other than as described in this Section 11.5. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 11.6 without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 


Section 11.6 Amendment; Waiver. 


(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Closing if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, that, prior to the Closing, the Company Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it has been first approved by the Conflicts Committee; and provided further that after the Parent Shareholder Approval or Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the further approval of the stockholders of Parent or the Company under applicable Law, as applicable, without such approval having first been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may this Section 11.6 or Section 11.5 or Section 11.12 (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent that an amendment of such provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) be amended in any manner adverse to the Debt Financing Sources with respect to any Debt Financing without the prior written consent of any Debt Financing Source adversely affected. 


(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law. 


Section 11.7 Governing Law. 


(a) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.   141

Section 11.8 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each Party irrevocably agrees and consents (a) to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any Action (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement, (b) that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware), and (d) that a final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. 


Section 11.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided that, prior to the Closing, the Company Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it has been first approved by the Conflicts Committee. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 


Section 11.10 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including the obligation of Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Parent OP to consummate, as applicable, the REIT Merger and the Partnership Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement), and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of damages or otherwise (including the Parties’ obligations to consummate the Mergers and the obligation of the Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Parent OP to pay, and the right of the holders of Company Common Shares and the holders of Company Partnership Units to receive, the REIT Merger Consideration and Redemption Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to the Mergers, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby waives (i) any defense in an Action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a security as prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Each Party agrees that the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right neither the Company nor the Company LP, on the one hand, nor Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Parent OP, on the other hand, would have entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other equitable remedies to the extent permitted by this Section 11.10 and the payment of damages, but shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of damages if specific performance or other equitable remedies are awarded and consummation of the Mergers occurs and shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of specific performance or other equitable remedies if damages are awarded.   142

(a) none of the Debt Financing Sources in respect of the Debt Financing shall have any liability hereunder or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby to the Company or its Affiliates (and the Company on behalf of itself and the Company Subsidiaries waives any rights or claims) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute related to, or arising from, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof; 


(b) the Company Parties shall not commence, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Affiliates not to commence (and if commenced agree to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not to assist) any action against any Debt Financing Source in respect of the Debt Financing in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, or the transactions contemplated hereby; 


(c) all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources in respect of the Debt Financing in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction;   143

(d) no Company Party will bring or purposely support any Person in any action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in respect of the Debt Financing in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York;

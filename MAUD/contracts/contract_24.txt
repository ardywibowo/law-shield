Sub, Golden, or any holder of any securities of Labrador, Merger Sub or Golden:   (a)            Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall represent one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time.   (b)            Capital Stock of Golden.   (i)            Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Golden (“Golden Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares, Converted Shares, or shares of Golden Common Stock subject to a Golden Restricted Share Award) (collectively, the “ Eligible Shares”) shall be converted into the right to receive from Labrador that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Labrador Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Merger Consideration”). As used in this Agreement, “Exchange Ratio” means 4.0146.   (ii)           All such Eligible Shares, when so converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i), shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each holder of a share of Golden Common Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Converted Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A)the Merger Consideration, (B)any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(g)and (C)any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the exchange of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.3(a).     7           (iii)          Each share of Golden Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as of and following the Effective Time. Without any action on the part of the holders of the Golden Preferred Stock, all outstanding certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of Golden Preferred Stock and book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of Golden Preferred Stock shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue to represent such shares of Golden Preferred Stock.   (iv)          All shares of Golden Common Stock held by Golden as treasury shares or by Labrador or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, “Excluded Shares”) shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Golden Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Golden or Labrador (other than Merger Sub) (“Converted Shares”) shall automatically be converted into a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Labrador Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.1(c)).   (c)            Impact of Stock Splits, Etc. Without limiting the parties’ respective obligations under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, in the event of any change in (i)the number of Eligible Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Eligible Shares or (ii)the number of shares of Labrador Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Labrador Common Stock (including options to purchase Labrador Common Stock), in each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.1(c). Nothing in this Section 3.1(c)shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement.     8           3.2            Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards.   (a)            Golden Restricted Share Awards.   (i)            At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of shares of Golden Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted pursuant to Golden’s Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Golden 2019 Incentive Plan”), 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, or any predecessor plan (collectively, the “Golden Equity Plans”) (a “Golden Restricted Share Award ”) that was granted prior to the date hereof and/or that is held by a non-employee member of the Golden Board shall (A)if subject solely to time-based vesting, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such Golden Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1 (less required withholdings as provided in Section 3.3(i)), and (B)if subject to performance-based vesting, become vested at the greater of the target level of performance and the level determined or certified by the Golden Board or the Compensation Committee of the Golden Board based on the results achieved during the applicable performance period, which period shall be deemed to end on the latest practicable date prior to the Effective Time, and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each vested share of Golden Common Stock subject to such Golden Restricted Share Award (without interest and less applicable Tax withholding); provided that for each Golden Restricted Share Award subject to performance-based vesting that was granted in 2020, if the level of vesting determined in accordance with this Section 3.2(a)(i)(B) is greater than the target level, then each vested share of Golden Common Stock that is in excess of the target number of shares of Golden Common Stock subject to such Golden Restricted Share Award shall instead be converted into the right to receive the Cash Equivalent Merger Consideration.

Prior to the Effective Time, the Golden Board or the Compensation Committee of the Golden Board shall adopt such resolutions as are required to effectuate the treatment of the Golden Restricted Share Awards, the Golden DSU Awards and the Golden Option Awards (collectively, the “Golden Equity Awards ”) pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.2.

Prior to the Effective Time, Labrador shall enter into, or cause Merger Sub to enter into, an agreement with Labrador’s or Golden’s transfer agent, or another firm reasonably acceptable to Golden and Labrador, to act as agent for the holders of Eligible Shares (the “Exchange Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Article III. On the Closing Date and prior to the Effective Time, Labrador shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for distribution in accordance with this Article III through the Exchange Agent, a number of shares of Labrador Common Stock constituting at least the amount necessary to satisfy the payment of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Article III. Labrador agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund to the holders of Eligible Shares (after taking into account all Eligible Shares then held by such holder). Except as contemplated by this Section 3.3(a)and Sections 3.3(g)and 3.3(h), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Labrador Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.3(h)and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(g)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” Labrador or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement.   (b)            Payment Procedures.   (i)            Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two Business Days after the Closing Date, Labrador shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Eligible Shares (“Certificates”), a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal” ) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration, which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Labrador and Golden prior to the Closing. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Labrador, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A)one or more shares of Labrador Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Labrador Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all shares of Golden Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B)a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g).     11

    (ii)             Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two Business Days after the Closing Date, Labrador shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Eligible Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) not held through DTC, (A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a statement reflecting the number of shares of Labrador Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Labrador Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all shares of Golden Common Stock then held by such holder) and (C)a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g).   (iii)            DTC Book-Entry Shares. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Labrador and Golden shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III.   (iv)            No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Article III.   (v)            With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g)and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)) is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g)and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)), to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Labrador that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g)and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)), shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of Golden as of the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b)(v), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, payable in respect of such shares, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h)and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g).     12           (c)          Termination of Rights . All Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g)and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)), paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Golden Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Golden Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Eligible Shares previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing Excluded Shares or Converted Shares), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h)and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g), without any interest thereon.   (d)          Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of Golden on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Labrador, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of Golden who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h)and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Labrador Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g), in each case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Labrador for payment of their claim for such amounts.   (e)           No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Labrador, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Golden Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration, properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration, in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Labrador, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (f)            Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing Excluded Shares or Converted Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent) and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Golden Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g).     13           (g)            Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Labrador Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Labrador Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the whole shares of Labrador Common Stock, that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book- Entry Shares and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 3.3. Following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Labrador Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)promptly after the time of such surrender,

the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Labrador Common Stock, and (ii)at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but with a subsequent payment date with respect to such whole shares of Labrador Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Labrador Common Stock, all whole shares of Labrador Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Labrador Common Stock, were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.   (h)            No Fractional Shares of Labrador Common Stock. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Labrador Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Labrador or a holder of shares of Labrador Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Labrador Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i)the aggregate net cash proceeds as determined below and (ii)a fraction, the numerator of which is such fractional part of a share of Labrador Common Stock, and the denominator is the number of shares of Labrador Common Stock constituting a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents the aggregate of all fractional entitlements of all holders of Golden Common Stock. As promptly as possible following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall sell at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE such number of shares of Labrador Common Stock constituting a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents the aggregate of all fractional entitlements of all holders of Golden Common Stock, with the cash proceeds (net of all commissions, transfer taxes and otherout-of-pocketcosts and expenses of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sales) of such sales to be used by the Exchange Agent to fund the foregoing payments in lieu of fractional shares (and if the proceeds of such share sales by the Exchange Agent are insufficient for such purpose, then Labrador shall promptly deliver to the Exchange Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the deficiency required to make all such payments in lieu of fractional shares).     14           (i)            Withholding Taxes . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Labrador, Golden, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law and shall pay the amount deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law. Labrador, Golden, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall cooperate in good faith to minimize any such deduction or withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Labrador, Golden, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.   3.4           No Appraisal Rights. In accordance with the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Transactions.   ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GOLDEN   Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered by Golden to Labrador and Merger Sub on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Golden Disclosure Letter”) and except as disclosed in the Golden SEC Documents (including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) filed with or furnished to the SEC and publicly available on EDGAR since December31, 2020 and at least two days prior to the date of this Agreement (without giving effect to any amendment to any such Golden SEC Document filed on or after the date that is two days prior to the date hereof) (excluding any disclosures set forth or referenced in any risk factor section or in any other section, in each case, to the extent they are forward- looking statements or cautionary, predictive, non-specific or forward-looking in nature), Golden represents and warrants to Labrador and Merger Sub as follows:   4.1          Organization, Standing and Power.

Each of Golden and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its assets and properties, makes such qualification or license necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify, license or be in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Golden Material Adverse Effect.

For purposes of the foregoing sentence, “good and defensible title” means that Golden’s or one or more of its Subsidiaries’, as applicable, record or beneficial title (as of the date hereof and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them) (1)entitles Golden (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest share shown in the Golden Reserve Reports of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties, (2)obligates Golden (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on the Golden Reserve Reports for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any increases in such percentage that are accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil and Gas Properties) and (3)is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).     27           (b)            Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Golden Material Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by or on behalf of Golden and its Subsidiaries to the Golden Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the Golden interests referred to in the Golden Reserve Reports, that was material to such firm’s estimates of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of Golden and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Golden Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided, accurate in all material respects.

Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Golden Reserve Reports that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Golden Material Adverse Effect.   (c)            Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Golden Material Adverse Effect, (i)all rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person under (or otherwise with respect to) any Oil and Gas Leases owned or held by Golden or any of its Subsidiaries have been properly and timely paid, (ii)all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Golden or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely and properly paid and (iii)none of Golden or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to Golden’s knowledge, no third-party operator) has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Golden or any of its Subsidiaries.   (d)            Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Golden Material Adverse Effect, all proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties of Golden and its Subsidiaries are being received by them in a timely manner and are not being held in suspense (by Golden, any of its Subsidiaries, any third-party operator thereof or any other Person) for any reason other than awaiting preparation and approval of division order title opinions for recently drilled Wells. Neither Golden nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated by virtue of a take-or-pay payment, advance payment, or similar payment (other than royalties, overriding royalties, deliveries required to resolve imbalances and similar arrangements established in the Oil and Gas Leases owned or held by Golden or its Subsidiaries) to deliver Hydrocarbons or proceeds from the sale thereof, attributable to such Person’s interest in its Oil and Gas Properties at some future time without receiving payment therefor at the time of delivery, except, in each case, as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Golden Material Adverse Effect.   (e)            All of the Wells and all water, CO2, injection or other wells (i)located on the Oil and Gas Properties of Golden and its Subsidiaries or on the Units included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Golden or its Subsidiaries or (ii)otherwise associated with an Oil and Gas Property of Golden or its Subsidiaries, have in each case been drilled, completed and operated within the limits permitted by the applicable contracts and Oil and Gas Leases entered into b y Golden or any of its Subsidiaries (or their respective predecessor in interest) related to such wells and applicable Law, and all drilling and completion (and plugging and abandonment) of such wells and all related development, production and other operations have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Law except, in each case, as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Golden Material Adverse Effect.     28           (f)            Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Golden Material Adverse Effect, none of the material Oil and Gas Properties of Golden or its Subsidiaries is subject to any preferential purchase, Consent or similar right that would become

and   (E)            at the end of the four Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect a Labrador Change of Recommendation, the Labrador Board takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Golden in writing and any other information offered by Golden in response to the notice, and determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Labrador Change of Recommendation in response to such Labrador Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Labrador Board to the stockholders of Labrador under applicable Law; provided that in the event of any material changes regarding any Labrador Intervening Event, Labrador shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Golden and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.4(e)(v)with respect to such new written notice, except that the advance written notice obligation set forth in this Section 6.4(e)(v)shall be reduced to two Business Days; provided, further, that any such new written notice shall in no event shorten the original four Business Day notice period.

  (f)            During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, Labrador shall not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, “standstill” or similar agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and Labrador shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary or Subsidiaries to, enforce the standstill provisions of any such agreement; provided that, notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6.4, prior to, but not after, the time the Labrador Stockholder Issuance Approval is obtained, if, in response to an unsolicited request from a third party to waive any “standstill” or similar provision, the Labrador Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties owed by the Labrador Board to the stockholders of Labrador under applicable Law, Labrador may waive any such “standstill” or similar provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a Labrador Competing Proposal to the Labrador Board and communicate such waiver to the applicable third party; provided, however, that Labrador shall advise Golden at least three Business Days prior to taking such action. Labrador represents and warrants to Golden that it has not taken any action that (i)would be prohibited by this Section 6.4(f)or (ii)but for the ability to avoid actions inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Labrador Board to the stockholders of Labrador under applicable Law, would have been prohibited by this Section 6.4(f), in each case, during the 30 days prior to the date of this Agreement.     73           (g)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, any action, or failure to take action, that is taken by a director or officer of Labrador or by any Representative of Labrador acting at Labrador’s direction or on its behalf, in each case, in violation of this Section 6.4, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.4 by Labrador.   6.5            Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement.   (a)            Labrador shall promptly furnish to Golden such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the holders of its capital stock, as Golden may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto used by Golden to obtain the adoption by its stockholders of this Agreement. Golden shall promptly furnish to Labrador such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the holders of its capital stock, as Labrador may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto.   (b)            Promptly following the date hereof, Golden and Labrador shall cooperate in preparing and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed with the SEC within 30 days of the date of this Agreement, (i)a mutually acceptable Joint Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the holders of Golden Common Stock at the Golden Stockholders Meeting and the holders of Labrador Common Stock at the Labrador Stockholders Meeting and (ii) the Registration Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a part). Golden and Labrador shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the rulesand regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Labrador and Golden shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as reasonably practicable and Labrador shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of Golden and Labrador will advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information. Each of Golden and Labrador shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of Golden and Labrador will (i)provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii)shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other and (iii)shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.     74           (c)            Labrador and Golden shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable “blue sky” laws and the rulesand regulations thereunder. Each Party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Labrador Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of Golden and Labrador will use reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.   (d)            If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Labrador or Golden, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Labrador or Golden that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Golden and Labrador.     75           6.6            Stockholders Meetings.   (a)            Golden shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of Golden to duly give notice of, convene and hold (in person or virtually, in accordance with applicable Law) a meeting of the holders of Golden Common Stock for the purpose of obtaining the Golden Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (and in any event will use reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting within 45 days thereof). Except as permitted by Section 6.3, the Golden Board shall recommend that the holders of Golden Common Stock vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Golden Stockholders Meeting and the Golden Board shall solicit from the holders of Golden Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the Golden Board Recommendation.

In addition, the Parties agree that, (A)for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, each Golden Employee and each Labrador Employee shall be provided with (1)a total target cash compensation opportunity (consisting of base salary or wages, as applicable, and annual cash incentive opportunity) that is no less favorable than that provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing; provided that a Golden Employee’s or a Labrador Employee’s base compensation (salary or wages, as applicable) shall not be reduced below the level in effect for such employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date; (2)target long-term incentive compensation opportunity that is no less favorable than that provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, which opportunities shall be provided in the manner specified in Schedule 6.9(a)of the Golden Disclosure Letter and otherwise so that no Golden Employee or Labrador Employee will be deprived of annual long-term incentive compensation awards for any calendar year as a result of differences in grant timing of long-term incentive awards by Golden and Labrador prior to the Closing Date; and (3)employee benefits (including retirement plan participation but excluding severance benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than that in effect for such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (B)for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, each Golden Employee and each Labrador Employee shall be provided with eligibility for severance benefits as set forth on Schedule 6.9(a)of the Golden Disclosure Letter (for Golden Employees) or Schedule 6.9(a) of the Labrador Disclosure Letter (for Labrador Employees).   (b)            From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, for all purposes under the New Plans, each Golden Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Golden and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and each Labrador Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Labrador and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, to the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any corresponding Golden Plan or Labrador Plan, as applicable, except for benefit accrual under any New Plan that is a “defined benefit plan” as defined in Section3(35) of ERISA, for purposes of eligibility for any retiree medical, dental or life benefits or disability benefits, or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service.   (c)            From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, the Parties shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) cause each Golden Employee and Labrador Employee and his or her eligible dependents to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Golden Plan or Labrador Plan in which such employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”); (ii)for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Golden Employee or Labrador Employee, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents; and (iii)use commercially reasonable efforts to give each Golden Employee and Labrador Employee credit under the applicable New Plans for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out-of- pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date under the corresponding Old Plans for which payment has been made, in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan provider.     81           (d)            From and after the Effective Time, Golden and Labrador shall honor, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to honor, all Golden Plans and Labrador Plans in accordance with their terms. The Parties agree that the Merger shall constitute a “change in control,” “change of control,” or term of similar import under each applicable Golden Plan and under each change in control agreement between Labrador and an officer thereof that is listed in Schedule 5.10(i) of the Labrador Disclosure Letter.   (e)            Labrador Performance-Based RSU Awards . At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit granted pursuant to a Labrador Equity Plan (a “Labrador Performance-Based RSU Award ”) prior to the date hereof to an officer of Labrador who is a party to a change in control agreement with Labrador listed in Schedule 5.10(i) of the Labrador Disclosure Letter shall be amended so that it will become vested at the Effective Time at the greater of the target level of performance and the level determined or certified by the Labrador Board or the Compensation Committee of the Labrador Board based on the results achieved during the applicable performance period, which period shall be deemed to end on the latest practicable date prior to the Effective Time, and be settled in Labrador Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement.   (f)            Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Golden, Labrador or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 6.9 are for the sole benefit of the Parties, and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Golden Employee, any Labrador Employee or any other service provider (who is a natural person) of Golden, Labrador or any of their respective Subsidiaries), other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any third-party beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.9) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.10 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such Party’s position with respect to such claims). With respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by Labrador or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.10, such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by Labrador or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services for Labrador, the Surviving Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last three years.   (b)            From and after the Effective Time, Labrador and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would) adversely the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement, except to the extent required by applicable Law.

Labrador and the Surviving Corporation shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render Labrador or Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy their obligations under this Section 6.10. The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this Section 6.10, and his heirs and Representatives. The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.10 are in addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of Golden or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Law.   6.11            Transaction Litigation.

The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by the Parties.

Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this Section 9.11, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party accordingly agrees (a)the non-breaching Party will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, (b)the alleged breaching Party will not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or Threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.11, and (c)the alleged breaching Party will not plead in defense thereto that there would be an adequate remedy at Law. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

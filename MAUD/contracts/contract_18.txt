AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 12, 2021 (this “Agreement”), by and between BancorpSouth Bank, a Mississippi-chartered bank (“BancorpSouth”), and Cadence Bancorporation, a Delaware corporation (“Cadence”).   RECITALS                  A.     The Boards of Directors of BancorpSouth and Cadence have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement, pursuant to which Cadence will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into BancorpSouth (the “Merger”), so that BancorpSouth is the surviving entity (in such capacity, the “Surviving Entity”) in the Merger.                  B.     In furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of BancorpSouth and Cadence have approved the Merger and adopted this Agreement and have resolved to submit this Agreement to their respective shareholders for approval and to recommend that their respective shareholders approve this Agreement.                  C.     For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.                  D.     Simultaneous with entering into this Agreement, BancorpSouth has entered into an agreement with each of James D. Rollins III, Paul B. Murphy Jr., Chris A. Bagley, Rudolph H. Holmes, IV and Valerie C. Toalson with respect to their ongoing employment and services to BancorpSouth from and after the Effective Time.                  E.      Immediately following the Merger, and subject to it occurring, Cadence Bank, N.A. (“Cadence Bank”) will merge with and into the Surviving Entity (the “Bank Merger” ) so that the Surviving Entity is the surviving entity in the Bank Merger.                  F.      In this Agreement, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

                NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I 




THE MERGER   1.1       The Merger and Bank Merger.   (a)       Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Mississippi Business Corporation Act (the “MBCA”), the Mississippi Code of 1972 (the “MS Code”) and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time, Cadence shall merge with and into BancorpSouth pursuant to this Agreement. BancorpSouth shall be the Surviving Entity, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Mississippi. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Cadence shall terminate.   (b)       At the Bank Merger Effective Time, Cadence Bank will merge with and into the Surviving Entity. The Surviving Entity shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Cadence Bank shall cease. The Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to that certain agreement and plan of merger between BancorpSouth and Cadence Bank, dated as of the date hereof, a form of which is attached as Exhibit B (the “Bank Merger Agreement”). Each of BancorpSouth and Cadence shall, and Cadence shall cause Cadence Bank to, execute certificates or articles of merger and such other agreements, documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (“Bank Merger Certificates”) at the Bank Merger Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall become effective immediately following the Effective Time in accordance with applicable law (the “Bank Merger Effective Time”).   1 . 2       Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) and the Bank Merger will take place by electronic exchange of documents at 10:00 a.m., Central time, on a date which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Cadence and BancorpSouth. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the “Closing Date.”   1.3       Effective Time. On or (if agreed by Cadence and BancorpSouth) prior to the Closing Date, BancorpSouth and Cadence, respectively, shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi (the “Mississippi Secretary”) in accordance with the MBCA and with the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance (the “Mississippi Department” ) in accordance with the MS Code and a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Secretary”) (collectively, the “Certificates of Merger”). The Merger shall become effective at such time as specified in the Certificates of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MBCA, MS Code and DGCL, or at such other time as shall be provided by applicable law (such time hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”).

 1 .4            Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the MBCA, the Code, the DGCL and this Agreement.   1 . 5           Conversion of Cadence Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of BancorpSouth, Cadence or the holder of any securities of BancorpSouth or Cadence:   (a)         Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Cadence Class A Common Stock”), of Cadence issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of the Class B Non-Voting Common Stock (the “ Cadence Class B Common Stock”), par value $0.01 per share, of Cadence issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “Cadence Common Stock”), except for shares of Cadence Common Stock owned by Cadence or BancorpSouth (in each case, other than shares of Cadence Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Cadence or BancorpSouth in respect of debts previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.70 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”; and such shares, the “Merger Consideration”) of the common stock, par value $2.50, of BancorpSouth (the “BancorpSouth Common Stock”); it being understood that at and after the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.6, the BancorpSouth Common Stock, including the shares issued to former holders of Cadence Common Stock, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Entity.   (b)          All of the shares of Cadence Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an “Old Certificate”; it being understood that any reference herein to “Old Certificate” shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Cadence Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of Cadence Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) a New Certificate representing the number of whole shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock that such shares of Cadence Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Cadence Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2, in each case, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock or Cadence Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to give BancorpSouth and the holders of Cadence Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to permit Cadence or BancorpSouth to take any action with respect to its securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 (c)           Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Cadence Common Stock that are owned by Cadence or BancorpSouth (in each case, other than shares of Cadence Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Cadence or BancorpSouth in respect of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no BancorpSouth Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   1 . 6         BancorpSouth Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of BancorpSouth Common Stock and each share of BancorpSouth Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock or preferred stock, as applicable, of the Surviving Entity and shall not be affected by the Merger.   1.7         Treatment of Cadence Equity Awards.   (a)         Each option to purchase shares of Cadence Common Stock (a “Cadence Stock Option”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be equitably adjusted immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the applicable Cadence plan and award agreement by reducing the exercise price thereof by an amount equal to the Special Dividend, contingent on the consummation of the Merger. At the Effective Time, each Cadence Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option (a “BancorpSouth Converted Stock Option”) to purchase (i) that number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Cadence Common Stock subject to such Cadence Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio (as adjusted if necessary pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.5(b)), (ii) at an exercise price per share of BancorpSouth Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per share of Cadence Common Stock of such Cadence Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio (as adjusted if necessary pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.5(b)); provided, however, that the exercise price and the number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the BancorpSouth Converted Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code; provided, further, that in the case of any BancorpSouth Converted Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.7(a), each such BancorpSouth Converted Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including exercisability and forfeiture terms), after giving effect to any “change in control” provisions under the applicable Cadence equity incentive plan or award agreement, as applied to the corresponding Cadence Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 (b)          At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Cadence Common Stock (a “Cadence RSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive (A) a restricted stock unit award (each, a “BancorpSouth Converted RSU Award ”) in respect of that number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Cadence Common Stock subject to the Cadence RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (as it may be adjusted if necessary pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.5(b)) and (B) the Special Dividend with respect to the number of shares of Cadence Common Stock subject to the Cadence RSU Award, which will be credited in cash to a dividend equivalent account (“DEU Account”) for the benefit of the award holder, with the BancorpSouth Converted RSU Award and the amount credited to the DEU Account in respect thereof to be subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting and settlement, as apply to the corresponding Cadence RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.7(b), each such BancorpSouth Converted RSU Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) as applied to the corresponding Cadence RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (c)          At the Effective Time, each performance stock unit (a “Cadence PSU Award ”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive (A) a BancorpSouth Converted RSU Award in respect of that number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) total number of shares of Cadence Common Stock subject to the Cadence PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Cadence Common Stock determined based on the higher of target performance and actual performance through the latest practicable date prior to the Effective Time as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the Cadence Board of Directors in consultation with BancorpSouth (the “Cadence Compensation Committee”), multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (as it may be adjusted if necessary pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.5(b)) and (B) the Special Dividend with respect to the number of shares of Cadence Common Stock subject to such Cadence PSU Award that is determined to be earned as provided herein, which will be credited in cash to a DEU Account for the benefit of the award holder, with the BancorpSouth Converted RSU Award and the amount credited to such DEU Account to be subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting and settlement, as applied with respect to the corresponding Cadence PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except as specifically provided in this Section 1.7(c), each such BancorpSouth Converted RSU Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including service-based vesting terms but not performance goals) as applied to the corresponding Cadence PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (d)          As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, Cadence shall take all actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of Cadence’s board of directors or a committee thereof and, if appropriate, amending the terms of Cadence’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) that may be necessary or required under the ESPP and applicable laws to (A) ensure that, except for the three month offering period under the ESPP that commenced on April 1, 2021 (the “Final Offering”), no offering period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (B) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the Final Offering, each individual participating in the Final Offering shall receive notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement no later than ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date and shall have an opportunity to terminate his or her outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP, (C) the Final Offering shall end no later than the Closing Date, (D) each ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Cadence Common Stock in accordance with the ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering, (E) the applicable purchase price for shares of Cadence Common Stock shall not be decreased below the levels set forth in the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement and (F) the ESPP shall terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time and no further rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

 (e )        At or prior to the Effective Time, Cadence, the Board of Directors of Cadence and the Cadence Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.7 and provide for the deduction, withholding and remittance of any Taxes or amounts required under applicable law.   (f)       As of the Effective Time, the number and kind of shares available for issuance under each Cadence equity or equity-based incentive plan shall be adjusted to reflect BancorpSouth Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable plan.

(b )        Prior to the Effective Time, BancorpSouth, the Board of Directors of BancorpSouth and the BancorpSouth Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.8.   1.9       Charter of Surviving Entity.

EXCHANGE OF SHARES   2 . 1       BancorpSouth to Make Consideration Available .  At or prior to the Effective Time, BancorpSouth shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent mutually agreed upon by BancorpSouth and Cadence (the “Exchange Agent”), for exchange in accordance with this Article II for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, certificates or, at BancorpSouth’s option, evidence in book-entry form, representing shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 (collectively, referred to herein as “New Certificates”), and cash in lieu of any fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such cash and New Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b), being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).   2.2          Exchange of Shares.   (a)         As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, BancorpSouth shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Cadence Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive BancorpSouth Common Stock pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates representing the number of whole shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, which the shares of Cadence Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock to which such holder of Cadence Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and (ii) a check representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and (y) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock which the shares of Cadence Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 (b)          No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to BancorpSouth Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock that the shares of Cadence Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.   (c)          If any New Certificate representing shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d)          After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Cadence of the shares of Cadence Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates representing shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2, as applicable.   (e)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to BancorpSouth Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of BancorpSouth. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, BancorpSouth shall pay to each former holder of Cadence Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of BancorpSouth Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the consecutive period of five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Cadence Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of BancorpSouth Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

 (f)           Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Cadence for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity. Any former holders of Cadence Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of the shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the BancorpSouth Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Cadence Common Stock such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of BancorpSouth, Cadence, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Cadence Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (g)          BancorpSouth shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Cadence Common Stock or Cadence Equity Awards, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by BancorpSouth or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Cadence Common Stock, Cadence Equity Awards in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by BancorpSouth or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.   (h)           In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by BancorpSouth or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as BancorpSouth or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and dividends or distributions, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(c)          The records, systems, controls, data and information of Cadence and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership of, or leased or provided as a service to, Cadence or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cadence. Cadence (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) to ensure that material information relating to Cadence, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Cadence by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Cadence’s outside auditors and the audit committee of Cadence’s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Cadence’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of Cadence, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Cadence’s internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of Cadence, any such disclosures were made in writing by management to Cadence’s auditors and audit committee. To the knowledge of Cadence, there is no reason to believe that Cadence’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.   (d)          Since January 1, 2019, (i) neither Cadence nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Cadence, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no employee of or attorney representing Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws or banking laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Cadence or any committee thereof or the Board of Directors or similar governing body of any Cadence Subsidiary or any committee thereof, or to the knowledge of Cadence, to any director or officer of Cadence or any Cadence Subsidiary.

 6 . 4          Shareholders’ Approvals. Each of BancorpSouth and Cadence shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the “BancorpSouth Meeting” and the “Cadence Meeting,” respectively) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Joint Proxy Statement is filed by BancorpSouth with the FDIC and Joint Proxy Statement is filed by Cadence with the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining (a) the Requisite BancorpSouth Vote and the Requisite Cadence Vote, respectively, required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and (b) if so desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of shareholders in connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and each of Cadence and BancorpSouth shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date and at the same time, and to set the same record date for each such meeting. Each of BancorpSouth and Cadence and their respective Boards of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of BancorpSouth and Cadence, respectively, the Requisite BancorpSouth Vote and the Requisite Cadence Vote, respectively, including by communicating to the respective shareholders of BancorpSouth and Cadence its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that, in the case of BancorpSouth, the shareholders of BancorpSouth approve this Agreement (the “BancorpSouth Board Recommendation”), and in the case of Cadence, that the shareholders of Cadence approve this Agreement (the “Cadence Board Recommendation”), BancorpSouth and each of BancorpSouth and Cadence and their respective Boards of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the other party the BancorpSouth Board Recommendation, in the case of BancorpSouth, or the Cadence Board Recommendation, in the case of Cadence, (ii) fail to make the BancorpSouth Board Recommendation, in the case of BancorpSouth, or the Cadence Board Recommendation, in the case of Cadence, in the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly and without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal, or (B) reaffirm the BancorpSouth Board Recommendation, in the case of BancorpSouth, or the Cadence Board Recommendation, in the case of Cadence, in each case, within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the BancorpSouth Meeting or the Cadence Meeting, as applicable) after an Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by the other party to do so, or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing a “Recommendation Change”). However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of BancorpSouth or Cadence, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the BancorpSouth Board Recommendation or the Cadence Board Recommendation, as applicable, such Board of Directors may, in the case of BancorpSouth, prior to the receipt of the Requisite BancorpSouth Vote, and in the case of Cadence, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Cadence Vote, submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event such Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided, that such Board of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless it (A) gives the other party at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to a n Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances), and (B) at the end of such notice period, takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the BancorpSouth Board Recommendation or Cadence Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.4 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.4. BancorpSouth or Cadence shall adjourn or postpone the BancorpSouth Meeting or the Cadence Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock or Cadence Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Cadence or BancorpSouth, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Cadence Vote or the Requisite BancorpSouth Vote, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cadence or BancorpSouth, as applicable, shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from its shareholders in order to obtain the Requisite Cadence Vote or Requisite BancorpSouth Vote, respectively. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the obligation to adjourn or postpone such meeting as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) the BancorpSouth Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of BancorpSouth at the BancorpSouth Meeting, and (y) the Cadence Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Cadence at the Cadence Meeting, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve either BancorpSouth or Cadence of such obligation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, BancorpSouth and Cadence agree that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the eighteen (18)-month anniversary thereof, any Continuing Employee or continuing employee of BancorpSouth and its Subsidiaries (in each case, other than those employees who are party to individual agreements that provide for severance benefits) who is involuntarily terminated during such eighteen (18)-month period will be provided with severance as described in Schedule 6.7(a) of the Cadence and BancorpSouth Disclosure Schedules.   (b )        For purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual (except not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or any purpose under the BancorpSouth Retirement Plan and Trust Agreement or to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of benefits) under the BancorpSouth Benefit Plans and the Cadence Benefit Plans, service with or credited by BancorpSouth, Cadence or any of their respective Subsidiaries or predecessors for Continuing Employees or continuing employees of BancorpSouth or its Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with BancorpSouth to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Cadence Benefit Plan or BancorpSouth Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Continuing Employees (i) shall receive service credit with respect to the BancorpSouth 401(k) plan and (ii) shall not receive service credit with respect to the BancorpSouth Retirement Plan and Trust Agreement. With respect to any Cadence Benefit Plan or BancorpSouth Benefit Plan in which any employees of BancorpSouth or Cadence (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which such employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time, BancorpSouth, Cadence and the Surviving Entity shall: (A) waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous BancorpSouth Benefit Plan or Cadence Benefit Plan, as the case may be, and (B) provide each such employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a BancorpSouth Benefit Plan or Cadence Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Cadence or BancorpSouth Benefit Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Cadence Benefit Plan or BancorpSouth Benefit Plan in which such employee first become eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

 6.8         Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.   (a)        From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall indemnify and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Cadence Articles, the Cadence Bylaws and the governing or organizational documents of any Cadence Subsidiary, each present and former director, officer or employee of Cadence and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Cadence Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses, any Cadence Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Cadence Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. The Surviving Entity shall reasonably cooperate with the Cadence Indemnified Parties, and the Cadence Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving Entity, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Without limiting the indemnification and other rights provided in this clause (a), all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of the Cadence Indemnified Parties as provided in any indemnification agreement in existence on the date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law, and shall be honored by the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries or their respective successors as if they were the indemnifying party thereunder, without any amendment thereto.   (b)          For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Cadence (provided, that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Cadence or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the Surviving Entity shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Cadence for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Entity’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, BancorpSouth or Cadence, in consultation with, but only upon the consent, of BancorpSouth, may (and at the request of BancorpSouth, Cadence shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year “tail” policy under Cadence’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

 (c)          The obligations of the Surviving Entity, BancorpSouth or Cadence under this Section 6.8 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Cadence Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.8 without the prior written consent of the affected Cadence Indemnified Party or affected person.   (d)          The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Cadence Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in each such case, the Surviving Entity will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.   6.9         Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of BancorpSouth, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Cadence, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Entity with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger or the Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by BancorpSouth.   6 . 1 0       Advice of Changes. BancorpSouth and Cadence shall each promptly advise the other party of any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on such first party, or (ii) that such first party believes would or would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.10 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

 6.14       Acquisition Proposals.   (a)         Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal (except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of such party, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.14), or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 6.14) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite BancorpSouth Vote, in the case or BancorpSouth, or the Requisite Cadence Vote, in the case of Cadence, a party receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions with the person making the Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that, prior to furnishing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, such party shall have provided such information to the other party to this Agreement and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement (“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”), which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with such party. Each party will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Cadence or BancorpSouth, as applicable, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each party will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise the other party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will provide the other party with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the other party reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. As used in this Agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” shall mean, with respect to BancorpSouth or Cadence, as applicable, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of a party and its Subsidiaries or twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party.

(b)      Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to such party’s shareholders; provided, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.   6.1 5    Public Announcements. Cadence and BancorpSouth agree that the initial press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a release mutually agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the parties agrees that no public release or announcement or statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental Entity or stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, or (ii) for such releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with other such releases, announcement or statements made after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this Section 6.15.   6 . 1 6    Change of Method.  Cadence and BancorpSouth shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the combination of Cadence and BancorpSouth (including the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock received by holders of Cadence Common Stock in exchange for each share of Cadence Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Cadence’s shareholders or BancorpSouth’s shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Cadence or BancorpSouth pursuant to this Agreement, or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 9.1.   6 . 1 7    Restructuring Efforts.  I f either Cadence or BancorpSouth shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Cadence Vote or the Requisite BancorpSouth Vote at the duly convened Cadence Meeting or BancorpSouth Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions provided for in this Agreement (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of Cadence as provided for in this Agreement, or any term that would adversely affect the tax treatment of the transactions contemplated hereby, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.17) to its respective shareholders for approval.

 6 . 1 8     Takeover Statutes .  None of Cadence, BancorpSouth or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.   6.19     Treatment of Cadence Indebtedness.  At and after the Effective Time, BancorpSouth shall assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be performed by Cadence under the indentures set forth on Section 6.19 of the Cadence Disclosure Schedule, and the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on, the notes governed thereby. In connection therewith, prior to the Effective Time, BancorpSouth and Cadence shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any supplemental indentures, officer’s certificates or other documents, and the parties hereto shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to provide any opinion of counsel to the trustee thereof, required to make such assumption effective as of the Effective Time.   6.20      Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b).  Cadence and BancorpSouth agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Cadence Insiders, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Cadence Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Cadence Common Stock into shares of BancorpSouth Common Stock in the Merger and the conversion of Cadence Equity Awards into corresponding BancorpSouth Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.20. Cadence shall deliver to BancorpSouth in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding those officers and directors of Cadence subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the “Cadence Insiders”), and the Board of Directors of BancorpSouth and of Cadence, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of Cadence) any dispositions of Cadence Common Stock or Cadence Equity Awards by the Cadence Insiders, and (in the case of BancorpSouth) any acquisitions of BancorpSouth Common Stock or BancorpSouth Equity Awards by any Cadence Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Entity subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

(e)       Each of BancorpSouth and Cadence acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if BancorpSouth or Cadence, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if BancorpSouth or Cadence, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” published in the Wall Street Journal on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full.

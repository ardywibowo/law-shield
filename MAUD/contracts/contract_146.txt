 ( i )            Cancellation of Treasury and Certain Other Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) that is owned by the Company as treasury stock, if any, each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, if any, and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof;   (ii)           Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.01(b) and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(a)(i) and the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Merger Consideration, payable as provided in Section 2.02, and, when so converted, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist; and   (iii)          Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock.

( b )         Adjustments to Merger Consideration. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (or any other securities convertible therefor or exchangeable thereto) shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, stock dividend or stock distribution, or any similar event, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to provide to Parent, Merger Sub and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 (b)           Payment Procedures.   (i)            Certificates. Promptly (but no later than two (2) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (a “Certificate”) and whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii): (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to Certificates held by such holder will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (ii) with respect to such shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the provisions of this Article II in respect of each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.   ( i i )           Book-Entry Shares. No holder of non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Book-Entry Shares”) and whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii) shall be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal in respect of such Book-Entry Shares or surrender such Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the provisions of this Article II in respect of each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.   (iii)          Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b). The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and make such payments and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices.   -5-

 (iv)          From and after the Effective Time, no further transfers may be made on the records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation, its transfer agent, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer following the Effective Time, such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as provided in Section 2.01(a)(ii).   (v)           If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book- Entry Share is registered, it will be a condition precedent of payment that:   (A)        either (1) the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed or is otherwise in proper form for transfer or (2) the Book- Entry Share is properly transferred; and   (B)         the Person requesting such payment shall have (1) paid any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share or (2) established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (vi)          At any time after the Effective Time and until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in each case as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as contemplated by Section 2.01(a)(ii) (subject to Section 2.04 in respect of Dissenting Shares). No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable hereunder in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.   ( c )           Termination of Payment Fund . The Paying Agent will deliver to the Surviving Corporation, upon the Surviving Corporation’s demand, any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all such funds) which remains undistributed to the former holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon expiration of the period ending one (1) year after the Effective Time. Thereafter, any former holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares prior to the Merger who has not complied with this Section 2.02 prior to such time may look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of his, her or its claim for Merger Consideration to which such holder may be entitled.   -6-

 ( d )           Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; provided that such investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United States, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers’ acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any of the Company’s stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall reasonably and promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund, so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.   (e)           No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official as required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   ( f )            Withholding Taxes . Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts for Taxes that Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so deducted and withheld shall be timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority and shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.   (g )           Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate, Parent will cause the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation to deliver and pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   SECTION 2.03       Equity Awards.   (a)          Company Options and Company SARs. At the Effective Time, each Company Option and Company SAR that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than three (3) Business Days) following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Company SAR as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Company SAR as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option or Company SAR which has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.   -7-

 ( b )           Company RSU Awards and Company Performance Share Awards . At the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award and each Company Performance Share Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by virtue of the Merger pursuant to Section 15(b) of the applicable Company Stock Plan and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, converted into the right to receive a cash payment (without interest) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award or Company Performance Share Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the “Company RSU Consideration”). For each Company Performance Share Award outstanding at the Effective Time, the actual Company RSU Consideration that will become payable will be determined based on (A) for Company Performance Share Awards issued in 2019, actual performance (measured consistent with the terms of the Company Performance Share Award represented by the Company RSU Consideration) through the end of the applicable performance period and (B) for Company Performance Share Awards issued in 2020 or 2021, target performance. The Company RSU Consideration shall remain subject to Vesting and Other Terms, in each case to the Company RSU Award or Company Performance Share Award to which such Vesting and Other Terms relate, and will be paid in accordance with the Vesting and Other Terms. For purposes of this Agreement and the Company RSU Consideration, the term “Vesting and Other Terms” shall mean all definitions, retirement vesting provisions, tax withholding and payment timing provisions, and employment termination protections set forth in Section 15(b) of the applicable Company Stock Plan, except that for Company RSU Consideration that represents Company RSU Awards or Company Performance Share Awards that would otherwise vest beyond the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the service-vesting schedule shall be accelerated to the business day that most immediately precedes the second anniversary of the Closing Date. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and/or the appropriate committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.03.   (c)           Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and/or the appropriate committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.03.   SECTION 2.04      Appraisal Rights.   (a)           Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and who are entitled to demand and have properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 o f the DGCL (a “Dissenting Share”) shall not be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01 and Section 2.02, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided that if, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise effectively waives, withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into, and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in accordance with Section 2.01 and Section 2.02, without any interest thereon.   -8-

 SECTION 4.06           Financing.   (a)           Parent is a party to and has accepted a fully executed debt commitment letter dated April 26, 2021 (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the “Debt Commitment Letter”) from the Lenders, pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the amounts set forth therein. The debt financing committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Debt Financing.”   (b)           Parent is a party to and has accepted a fully executed commitment letter dated April 26, 2021 (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the “Equity Commitment Letter” and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the “Commitment Letters”), from Standard Industries Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Equity Investor”), pursuant to which the Equity Investor has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the amounts set forth therein. The cash equity committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter is referred to in this Agreement as the “Cash Equity.” The Cash Equity and the Debt Financing are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Financing.” The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third-party beneficiary of, and is entitled to specifically enforce, the Equity Commitment Letter.   (c)           Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters and any fee letters related thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee amounts, pricing caps, market flex and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with transactions of this type and that could not in any event affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or amount of the Debt Financing.   (d)           Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders and the Equity Investor to provide the Debt Financing or the Cash Equity, as applicable, or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing or the Equity Investor to reduce the total amount of the Cash Equity, including any condition or other contingency relating to the amount or availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to any “flex” provision. Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have Knowledge that any of the Lenders or the Equity Investor will not perform its obligations thereunder. There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment Letters that could affect the availability, enforceability, conditionality or amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters.   (e)           Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 3.03, 3.06 and 3.17 and the performance by the Company of its obligations under Section 5.01, in each case in all material respects, the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters, when added together with Available Cash and marketable securities of the Company, will be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement and under the Commitment Letters, including to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration, to pay any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date, and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of Parent, the Company, and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or the Commitment Letters (such amounts, collectively, the “Merger Amounts”).   -30-

 (f)            The Commitment Letters constitute the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, all of the other parties thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions, and are in full force and effect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters, and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III and the performance by the Company, in all material respects, of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent at the Closing. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. The Commitment Letters have not been modified, amended or altered and none of the respective commitments thereunder has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated. No modification or amendment to the Commitment Letters is currently contemplated.   (g)           In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing be a condition to any of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement.   SECTION 4.07           Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Guarantor has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the Guaranty. The Guaranty is in full force and effect, has not been amended, modified, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantor, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. No event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) could constitute a default or breach on the part of the Guarantor under the Guaranty.   SECTION 4.08           Brokers’ Fees and Expenses . Except for Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial advisor’s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.   SECTION 4.09           Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. All outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Parent owns all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has been incorporated solely for the purpose of merging with and into the Company and taking action incident to the Merger and this Agreement. Merger Sub has no assets, liabilities or obligations and has not, since the date of its formation, carried on any business or conducted any operations, except, in each case, as arising from the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its covenants and agreements hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.   -31-

The vote or consent of Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, is the only vote or consent of the shareholders of Merger Sub or the holders of any other securities of Merger Sub (equity or otherwise) required in order for Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.   SECTION 4.11           Ownership of Company Common Stock; Interested Stockholder.

Assuming the accuracy of the Company Reports with respect to the Company Common Stock, neither Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent nor any of their respective Affiliates or associates is, or has been at any time during the period commencing three (3) years prior to the date hereof, an “interested stockholder” (as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company.   SECTION 4.12          Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the Effective Time and immediately after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts, assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III (as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedule), (ii) the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants and agreements set forth in Article V (as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedule) in all material respects, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 4.12, the term “Solvent” means, with respect to any Person as of a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of such Person exceeds its debts, (b) such Person has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature and (c) such Person does not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this Section 4.12, “debt” means any liability whether or not reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. For purposes of this Section 4.12, the amount of any unliquidated or contingent liabilities at any time shall be the maximum amount which, in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, could reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.   SECTION 4.13          Certain Arrangements. Except as disclosed in the Schedule 13D, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates is a party to any binding commitment (1) with any director or officer of the Company relating to the Company or any of its businesses or Subsidiaries (including those businesses and Subsidiaries following the Closing) or the transactions contemplated hereby (including as to continuing employment or equity roll-over); or (2) with any other stockholder of the Company.   -32-

(c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) if the Company receives a bona fide, written Company Takeover Proposal that does not result from a material breach of Section 5.02(a) and the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during the five (5) Business Day period referred to in clause (iii) below) that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) unless (i) the Company Board has provided five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) in response to a Superior Company Proposal, which written notice shall include the material terms and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal, (ii) if requested by Parent, during the five (5) Business Day period after delivery of such written notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent and (iii) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period and taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent (it being understood and agreed that if there has been any subsequent amendment to any material term of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company Board shall provide a new written notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period from the date of such written notice shall apply), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) as a result of such Superior Company Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In determining whether to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i), the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such a written notice.   -39-

 (d)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) a Company Intervening Event has occurred or (ii) the Company has received a Superior Company Proposal that does not result from a material breach of Section 5.02(a) and, in each case, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during the five (5) Business Day period referred to in clause (iii) below) that the failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the occurrence of such Company Intervening Event or in response to the receipt of such Superior Company Proposal, as the case may be, would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (i) the Company Board has provided five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the occurrence of a Company Intervening Event or the receipt of a Superior Company Proposal, which written notice shall, in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of a Company Intervening Event, describe such Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail and, in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the receipt of a Superior Company Proposal, include the material terms and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal, (ii) if requested by Parent, during the five (5) Business Day period after delivery of such written notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding revisions to this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent and (iii) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period and taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent (it being understood and agreed that if there has been any subsequent amendment to any material term of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company Board shall provide a new written notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period from the date of such notice shall apply), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the Parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect.   (e)           The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Company Takeover Proposal, any request outside the ordinary course of business for material non-public information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party (other than by any Governmental Entity or in connection with obtaining the Required Statutory Approvals) which request could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal or request (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or request, and (ii) any Company Intervening Event or any facts and circumstances that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Intervening Event. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all material respects on a reasonably current basis of the material terms and status (including any change to the material terms thereof) of any Company Takeover Proposal or request and, in the case of a Company Intervening Event, keep Parent informed in all material respects on a current basis of the facts and circumstances related to such Company Intervening Event.   -40-

The Company shall in no event be deemed to violate this Section 5.02 as a result of responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the Person making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section 5.02.

( i i )         “Superior Company Proposal” means a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal (provided that for purposes of this definition, the applicable percentage in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be “50%” rather than “15%”), that did not result from, or arise in connection with, any material breach of this Section 5.02, that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal, the conditionality of and contingencies related to such proposal, the expected timing and risk of completion, the identity of the Person making such proposal and such other factors that are deemed relevant by the Company Board, is (A) reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed and (B) is more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any proposed revisions to the terms of this Agreement that are committed to in writing by Parent).   -41-

The foregoing notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 6.03 that would: (A) require the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors, officers or employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing or execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement, in each case that would be effective prior to the Closing (provided that in no event will any officer or director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries be so required to take any such action if such Person is not going to continue to hold such offices and positions from and after the Closing and in no event will the Company Board be required to pass resolutions or consents related to the Financing (it being understood that members of the Company Board who will continue as directors of the Company after the Closing may be required to pass resolutions or consents relating to the Financing provided that such resolutions or consents will not be effective until the Closing)), (B) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (C) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing or have any obligation under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective prior to the Closing, in each case that would not be reimbursed or indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.03, (D) cause any director, officer, Representative or employee or stockholder of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (E) reasonably be expected to conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any covenant or agreement in or any contract to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or the Organizational Documents of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any Laws, (F) provide access to or require the disclosure of any information that the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or is restricted by Contract or applicable Law or could result in the disclosure of any trade secrets, (G) require the preparation of any financial statements or information that are not available to it and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice (except for the Required Information), any pro forma financial information or projections, or any financial information with respect to a fiscal period that has not yet ended, (H) require the Company’s or any of the Company Subsidiaries’ internal or external legal counsel to deliver any legal opinion in connection with the Debt Financing or (I) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective if the Closing does not occur. Nothing contained in this Section 6.03 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable, documented and invoiced out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this Section 6.03 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financing, any action taken by them pursuant to this Section 6.03 and the provision of any information used in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.03), except to the extent such losses arise out of the gross negligence, bad faith, fraud or wilful misconduct of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives.   -50-

In connection with the Existing Notes Refinancing, Parent may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents in consultation with the Company to provide assistance in connection therewith and their fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid directly by Parent. The consummation of any or all of the Consent Solicitations and/or the Existing Notes Refinancing shall not be a condition to Closing.   -51-

In no event shall the aggregate cost for the D&O Insurance during the Tail Period exceed the amount set forth in Section 6.08(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, that if the aggregate of such D&O Insurance exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain policies which, in its good faith determination, provide the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such other Person or the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to its obligations set forth in this Section 6.08.   -55-

 (ii)           In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (A) Section 8.01(c)(ii) (Parent Breach) or (B) Section 8.01(c)(iii) (Parent Failure to Close ), then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $281,000,000 in cash (the “Parent Termination Fee”) no later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the date of such termination by wire transfer of same day funds; provided, that any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.01(b)(i) (End Date) shall be deemed to be a termination under Section 8.01(c)(ii) (Parent Breach) or Section 8.01(c)(iii) (Parent Failure to Close) if, at the time of such termination, the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii) (Parent Breach) or Section 8.01(c)(iii) (Parent Failure to Close) (ignoring, for this purpose, the three (3) Business Day period referred to in Section 1.03).   (c)           Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that (i) the fees and other agreements contained in Section 8.02(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Company Termination Fee nor Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the other Party in the circumstances in which such fee is payable, and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either Party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.02(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, the payee Party brings a Claim that results in a judgment against the payor Party for the amount set forth in Section 8.02(b) or any portion thereof, the payor Party will pay to the payee Party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Claim, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (the “Enforcement Expenses”). The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company or Parent, as applicable, be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion. All payments under this Section 8.02 shall be made by the payor Party to the payee Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the payee Party.

(d)           Sole and Exclusive Remedy.   (i)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing or otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder, then, except for an order of specific performance as permitted by Section 9.10, the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy against (1) Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor and the Equity Investor, (2) the former, current and future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or assignees of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any Equity Investor, and (3) any future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Parent Group” ) and the Lender Entities in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, including the Commitment Letters and the Guaranty, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be (without limiting the proviso set forth in Section 8.02(b)(ii) or the Company’s right to collect the Parent Termination Fee in the event of a termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) in accordance with such proviso) to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Article VIII and collect, if due, the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.02(b) (including any Enforcement Expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.02(c)) and, as applicable, the reimbursements contemplated by Section 6.02(a), Section 6.03 and Section 6.07. If the Parent Termination Fee is due pursuant to Section 8.02(b), (A) the Company’s right to receive the Parent Termination Fee (including any Enforcement Expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.02(c)) and, as applicable, the reimbursements contemplated by Section 6.02(a), Section 6.03 and Section 6.07 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of each and any member of the Company Group for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement or the failure of the Closing to be consummated and (B) upon due payment of such amounts, no member of the Parent Group or Lender Entity shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, the Commitment Letters or the Guaranty, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub and the Lender Entities together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates related to the failure of the Closing to occur, or a breach of this Agreement or failure to perform hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise, shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to: (i) the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (plus any Enforcement Expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.02(c)) plus (ii) the amount of the reimbursements contemplated by Section 6.02(a), Section 6.03 and Section 6.07, and in no event shall the Company, its Subsidiaries, or its Affiliates seek any amount in excess of such aggregate amount in connection with th is Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing in this Section 8.02(d)(i) limits Parent’s or its Affiliates’ liability under the Confidentiality Agreement or the Company’s right to pursue specific performance as provided in Section 9.10.   -65-

 (ii)           If this Agreement is terminated in circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is due and payable pursuant to Section 8.02(b)(i)(A) o r Section 8.02(b)(i)(B), then (A) Parent’s right to receive the Company Termination Fee (including any Enforcement Expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.02(c)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Group for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement or the failure of the Closing to be consummated, and (B) no member of the Company Group shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. “Company Group” means, collectively, (1) the Company and its Subsidiaries, (2) the former, current and future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or assignees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (3) any future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or assignees of any of the foregoing.

If this Agreement is terminated in circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is due and payable pursuant to Section 8.02(b)(i)(C), the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Group for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement or the failure of the Closing to be consummated shall be, as elected by Parent in accordance with Section 8.02(b)(i)(C), either (x) Parent’s right to receive the Company Termination Fee (including any Enforcement Expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.02(c)), in which case no member of the Company Group shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (y) Parent’s right to seek monetary damages from the Company in respect of the Company’s Willful Breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement (it being understood that the remedies set forth in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) are mutually exclusive as set forth in Section 8.02(b)(i)(C)). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing in this Section 8.01(d)(ii) limits the Company’s or its Affiliates’ liability under the Confidentiality Agreement or Parent and Merger Sub’s right to pursue specific performance as provided in Section 9.10.   -66-

SECTION 9.09           Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.   SECTION 9.10           Specific Enforcement.   (a)           The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any Party does not perform any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach or threaten to breach any such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, subject to the limitations in Section 8.02(d)(i), Section 8.02(d)(ii) and Section 9.10(b), the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause each other Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 9.11 without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable or not appropriate for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. The Parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 9.10(b), the Company shall be entitled to specific performance (or any other equitable relief) to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Closing on the terms set forth herein.   (b)           Notwithstanding Section 9.10(a), it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to obtain specific performance (or any other equitable relief) of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the requirements that:   (i)            Parent has failed to consummate the Closing in accordance with Section 1.03;   -72-

Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of Claim arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in such court and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Claim brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.02 shall be effective service of process for any Claim brought against such Party in any such court.   (b)           Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to submit itself, and hereby irrevocably submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) irrevocably agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) irrevocably agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, and (iv) irrevocably consents to service of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.02.   SECTION 9.12           Waiver of Jury Trial .

EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES (A) THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS AND (C) THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.   -73-

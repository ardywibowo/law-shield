THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  (this “Agreement”), dated as of February 9, 2021, is by and among Tyler Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tyler”), Topos Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly owned by Tyler (“ Merger Sub”) (Tyler and Merger Sub are sometimes collectively referred to as the “Tyler Entities” and individually as a “Tyler Entity”), and NIC Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NIC”). Tyler, Merger Sub, and NIC are sometimes referred to collectively herein as the “Parties” and individually as a “Party.” 


RECITALS 


A.          It is proposed that Merger Sub shall merge with and into NIC, with NIC surviving the merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Tyler (the “Merger”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), pursuant to which each share of NIC Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 


B.          The board of directors of NIC (the “NIC Board of Directors”) unanimously (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Transactions”), including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, NIC and its stockholders (the “NIC Stockholders”), (ii) approved the execution and delivery by NIC of this Agreement, the performance by NIC of its covenants and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the NIC Stockholders adopt this Agreement (the “NIC Board Recommendation”). 


C.          The boards of directors of each of Tyler and Merger Sub have determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, Tyler, Merger Sub, and their respective stockholders and approved this Agreement, and Tyler as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub has adopted this Agreement. 


D.          The Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in connection with the Transactions and also to prescribe various conditions to the Transactions. 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE II THE MERGER 


2 . 1          The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into NIC at the Effective Time.  Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and NIC shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”). 


2.2          Closing.  The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place by means of a virtual closing through electronic exchange of documents and signatures at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by Tyler and NIC. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date.” 


2.3          Effective Time.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the Tyler Entities and NIC shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the “Merger Filing”), and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the DGCL.  The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Merger Filing is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.  The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the “Effective Time.” 


2 . 4          Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein, in the Merger Filing and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses, and authority of NIC and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and duties of each of NIC and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 


2.5          Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. 


(a)          At the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.8, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof; provided, however, that the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub shall be amended at the Effective Time to change the name of the corporation set forth therein from “Topos Acquisition, Inc.” to “NIC Inc.” 


(b)          At the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.8, the Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with terms thereof; provided, however, that the Bylaws of Merger Sub shall be amended at the Effective Time to change the name of the corporation set forth therein from “Topos Acquisition, Inc.” to “NIC Inc.” 


2 . 6          Directors and Officers.  The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE III EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT COMPANIES 


3 . 1          Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the holder of any shares of NIC Common Stock or any capital stock of Merger Sub: 


( a )          Cancellation of Cancelled Shares.  Each share of NIC Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by either Tyler Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries and each share of NIC Common Stock that is owned by NIC or any NIC Subsidiary, including shares of NIC Common Stock held as treasury stock (collectively, the “Cancelled Shares”), shall automatically be canceled at the Effective Time and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 


(b )          Conversion of NIC Common Stock.  Each share of NIC Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled Shares, (B) such shares that are Dissenting Shares, and (C) shares of NIC Common Stock subject to the Assumed RSAs) shall be converted into the right to receive $34.00 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”), without interest thereon, which shall be payable in accordance with Section 3.3.  At the Effective Time, all such shares of NIC Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of NIC Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration. 


(c)          Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock.  Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 


( d )          Adjustments.  The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into NIC Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of NIC Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 3.1(d) shall be construed to permit NIC to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 


3 . 2          Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 3.1, shares of NIC Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to and has properly demanded appraisal of such shares of NIC Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of NIC Common Stock being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws, or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares of NIC Common Stock) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such consideration as may be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however,  that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws, or loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of NIC Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, without interest thereon, and such shares of NIC Common Stock shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares.  NIC shall provide Tyler (a) prompt written notice of any demands received by NIC for appraisal of shares of NIC Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to NIC prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and (b) the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood that, subject to good-faith consultation with Tyler, NIC will have the right to direct and control any such negotiations and proceedings).  NIC shall not, except with the prior written consent of Tyler, (i) make any payment with respect to any such demand, (ii) offer to settle or settle any such demand or (iii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

3.3          Payment; Stock Certificates. 


(a)          Payment Fund; Paying Agent.  Prior to the Effective Time, Tyler shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to NIC to act as its paying agent in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”).  At or immediately after the Effective Time, Tyler shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1 (the “Exchange Fund”) in trust for the sole benefit of the holders of NIC Common Stock. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1, Tyler shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional cash with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the shortfall that is required to make such payment. Tyler shall cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Section 3.3. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Tyler; provided, however, that any such investment (i) shall not relieve Tyler from making any payments required by this Agreement, (ii) shall not have a maturity that could prevent or delay any payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A‑1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and (iv) no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this ARTICLE III. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Tyler. Tyler shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of NIC Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. 


(b)          Payment Procedures. 


( i )          NIC Common Stock Certificates.  Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event later than four Business Days after the Closing Date), Tyler shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Stock Certificate and whose shares of NIC Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Stock Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Tyler, an indemnity bond) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Tyler may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Stock Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Tyler, an indemnity bond) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into which such shares of NIC Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1.  Upon surrender of a Stock Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Tyler, an indemnity bond) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Tyler shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Merger Consideration therefor pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE III for each share of NIC Common Stock formerly represented by such Stock Certificate, and the Stock Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Tyler, an indemnity bond) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Stock Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Tyler, an indemnity bond) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Stock Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Tyler that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid.

________________


(ii)          Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of any Book-Entry Shares and whose shares of NIC Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a Stock Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Tyler shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days following the Effective Time), the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE III for each share of NIC Common Stock formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith cancelled. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, Tyler and NIC shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and DTC to ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days following the Effective Time), upon surrender of shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration for each such share.  In the event that the transfer of a Book-Entry Share is not registered in the transfer or stock records of NIC or payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Person requesting such payment shall have (A) provided the Paying Agent the Book- Entry Share formerly representing such shares of NIC Common Stock, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and (B) paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Tyler that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. 


( c )          No Interest.  No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Stock Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or in respect of any Book-Entry Share. 


( d )          Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in NIC Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of NIC shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of NIC Common Stock on the records of NIC. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of NIC Common Stock formerly represented by such Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as contemplated by this ARTICLE III. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Tyler for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 


(e)          Lost Stock Certificates.  If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1. 


(f )          Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Tyler shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed to holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, other than any such funds for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent’s routine administrative procedures, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Tyler (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Stock Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), if applicable, and compliance with the procedures in Section 3.3(b), without any interest thereon, and Tyler shall remain liable for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Stock Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), if applicable, and compliance with the procedures in Section 3.3(b).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Tyler, NIC, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

3.4          Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards; ESPP. 


(a)          Immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each outstanding NIC Restricted Stock Award that is fully vested and not subject to any restrictions (or that, pursuant to its terms as in effect as of the date hereof or the terms of this Agreement, will accelerate in full and no longer be subject to any further vesting as a result of or in connection with the consummation of the Transactions), shall be released to the holder thereof, to the extent not previously released, and shall be converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive, with respect to each share of NIC Common Stock subject to such NIC Restricted Stock Award (as determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement relating thereto), the Merger Consideration, less all applicable withholding and other authorized deductions. 


(b)          At the Effective Time, each NIC Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that vests solely based on the achievement of performance goals shall automatically vest in full and be cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive, with respect to each share of NIC Common Stock subject to such NIC Restricted Stock Award (as determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement relating thereto), the Merger Consideration, less all applicable withholding and other authorized deductions. 


(c)          At the Effective Time, each outstanding NIC Restricted Stock Award that vests solely based on the passage of time (other than any NIC Restricted Stock Award or portion thereof covered b y Section 3.4(a)) held by an individual who, immediately after the Effective Time, will constitute an “employee” of Tyler within the meaning of SEC Form S-8 (each, an “Assumed RSA”), shall, without any action on the part of Tyler, NIC, or the holder thereof, be assumed and converted automatically into a Tyler Restricted Stock Award on the same terms and conditions (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Effective Time) as applicable to such Assumed RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the number of shares of restricted Tyler Common Stock subject to such Assumed RSA shall equal the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of NIC Common Stock subject to the Assumed RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time (as determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement relating thereto) by (ii) the Restricted Stock Conversion Ratio, with such product rounded up to the nearest whole share.  Each Assumed RSA shall otherwise be subject to the Tyler Stock Plan. 


( d )          To the extent not covered by an effective registration statement on SEC Form S-8 with respect to shares of Tyler Common Stock issuable under the Tyler Stock Plan, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (but in no event more than five Business Days following the Closing Date), Tyler shall file a registration statement on SEC Form S‑8 (or any successor form) with respect to the issuance of the shares of Tyler Common Stock subject to the Assumed RSAs and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Assumed RSAs remain outstanding. 


(e)          Prior to the Effective Time, NIC shall terminate the NIC Stock Plan effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the consummation of the Merger. 


(f)          As soon as practicable following the date hereof, NIC shall take all actions with respect to the NIC ESPP that are necessary to provide that:  (i) with respect to the offering period currently in progress as of the date hereof (the “Current ESPP Offering Period”), (A) no employee who is not a participant in the Current ESPP Offering Period as of the date hereof may become a participant in the Current ESPP Offering Period, (B) no participant may increase the percentage amount of the participant’s payroll deduction election form that is in effect on the date hereof for such Current ESPP Offering Period; (C) the Current ESPP Offering Period shall terminate at the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such Current ESPP Offering Period and (y) immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (D) each participant’s accumulated payroll deduction shall be used to purchase shares of NIC Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the NIC ESPP on the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase date for such Current ESPP Offering Period and (y) immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) no additional offering periods shall commence after the date hereof; and (iii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the NIC ESPP shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(g)          Prior to the Effective Time, NIC shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary so as to cause the treatment of NIC Restricted Stock Awards, the NIC Stock Plan, and the NIC ESPP as contemplated by this Section 3.4. 


3 . 5          Withholding. Each of NIC, Tyler, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Law.

NIC and its ERISA Affiliates have performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under each NIC Plan, and NIC is not in default or violation of, and has no Knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to, the terms of any NIC Plan.

Each NIC Plan may be terminated by NIC, or, if applicable, by an ERISA Affiliate in accordance with its terms and without any material liability, cost, or expense to NIC, other than costs and expenses that are customary in connection with the termination or amendment, as applicable, of a comparable employee benefit plan and benefits that are accrued under such NIC Plan as of the date of such amendment or termination. 


(b)          Each NIC Plan listed on Section 4.16(a) of the NIC Disclosure Letter is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and any other applicable Law.

Except as set forth on Section 4.16(b) of the NIC Disclosure Letter, each NIC Plan that is intended to be “qualified” within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (a “Qualified Plan”) is so qualified and, to NIC’s Knowledge, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Plan. With respect to each NIC Plan that is subject to Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code and similar state Law provisions, the applicable requirements thereof have been satisfied in all material respects by NIC and each ERISA Affiliate, including all requirements relating to eligibility waiting periods and the offer of or provision of minimum essential coverage that is compliant with Section 36B(c)(2)(C) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder to full-time employees as defined in Section 4980H(c)(4) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.

As of the date hereof, Tyler does not have reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition to the Initial Financing under the Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it at or prior to the Closing, or that any portion of the Initial Financing contemplated thereby will be unavailable to Tyler at the Closing. Tyler has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letter that are due and payable on or before the date of this Agreement.  Each of Tyler and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to the Merger or any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Tyler or Merger Sub obtain the Financing (including the Initial Financing) or any other financing for or related to any of the Transactions.

6.3          No Solicitation by NIC. 


(a)          Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.3, from and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, NIC agrees that it shall not, and shall cause the NIC Subsidiaries, and its and their respective officers and directors not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the NIC Subsidiaries’ other Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of providing information) any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission o r announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information relating to NIC or any NIC Subsidiary in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) adopt, approve, endorse, or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse, or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) withdraw, change, amend, modify, or qualify, or otherwise publicly propose to withdraw, change, amend, modify, or qualify, in each case, in a manner adverse to Tyler, the NIC Board Recommendation; (v) fail to include the NIC Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (vi) approve, authorize, or cause or permit NIC or any NIC Subsidiary to enter into, any merger agreement, acquisition agreement, reorganization agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or similar definitive agreement with respect to, or any other definitive agreement or commitment providing for, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 6.3) (a “NIC Acquisition Agreement”); or (vii) call or convene a meeting of the NIC Stockholders to consider a proposal that would reasonably be expected to materially impair, prevent, or delay the consummation of the Transactions (any act described in clauses (iii), (iv), or (v) that is taken, authorized, or, solely with respect to clause (v), permitted by the NIC Board of Directors, a “Change of Recommendation”). NIC shall, and shall cause the NIC Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and directors to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the NIC Subsidiaries’ other Representatives to, immediately cease any and all solicitation, encouragement, discussions, or negotiations with any persons (or provision of any information to any persons) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event within two Business Days following the date hereof), NIC shall (A) request in writing that each person (as defined below) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal promptly destroy or return to NIC all nonpublic information heretofore furnished by NIC or any of its Representatives to such person or any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement and (B) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to such person’s consideration of an Acquisition Proposal. NIC shall enforce, and not waive, terminate, or modify without Tyler’s prior written consent, any confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill, or other agreement entered into prior to the date hereof with any person in connection with such person’s consideration of an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that, if the NIC Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with NIC’s outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular standstill provision would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, NIC may, with prior written notice to Tyler, waive such standstill solely to the extent necessary to permit the applicable person (if it has not been solicited in violation of Section 6.3(a)(i) or (ii)) to make, on a confidential basis to the NIC Board of Directors, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Tyler, in each case, as contemplated by this Section 6.3. For purposes of this Section 6.3, the term “person” means any Person or “group,” as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to NIC, any NIC Subsidiary, Tyler, any Tyler Subsidiary, or any of their Representatives. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Section 6.3(a), if NIC receives, prior to the NIC Stockholder Approval being obtained, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry, proposal, or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.3(a)(i) or (ii), NIC, the NIC Subsidiaries, and NIC’s Representatives may contact the person or any of its Representatives who has made such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, or offer to (x) refer the inquiring, proposing or offering person to this Section 6.3, or (y) solely to clarify or ascertain facts regarding (and not to negotiate or engage in any discussions regarding or relating to) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, or offer and the person making it so that NIC may inform itself about such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, or offer and the person making it. For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3 by (x) a NIC Subsidiary, (y) a director or officer of NIC or any NIC Subsidiary, or (z) any other Representatives acting at the direction of NIC or any NIC Subsidiary shall be a breach of this Section 6.3 by NIC.

(b)          Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Agreement, if NIC or any of its Representatives receives, prior to the NIC Stockholder Approval being obtained, an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.3(a)(i) or (ii), which the NIC Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with NIC’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then in either event NIC may take the following actions: (A) furnish information with respect to NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, NIC receives from such person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and NIC also provides Tyler, prior to or substantially concurrently with (and in any event within 24 hours after) the time such information is provided or made available to such person, any nonpublic information furnished to such other person that was n o t previously furnished to Tyler, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with such person and its Representatives with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.  NIC shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after such determination) inform Tyler in writing if NIC determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this Section 6.3(b). 


(c)          NIC shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after, to the Knowledge of NIC or the knowledge of its financial advisor, its receipt) notify Tyler of NIC’s or any NIC Subsidiary’s or its or their respective Representatives’ receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiries, proposals or offers that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, or offer, and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, proposal or offer, or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry, including unredacted copies of any written proposals or offers, including proposed written agreements received by NIC or its Representatives relating to such Acquisition Proposal or, if such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a reasonably detailed written description of the material terms and conditions thereof. Without limiting NIC’s other obligations under this Section 6.3, NIC shall keep Tyler reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status (including any material developments related thereto) of any such Acquisition Proposal, and promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after) notify Tyler of any material amendments to the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after) provide to Tyler copies of all proposed written agreements relating to an Acquisition Proposal received by NIC or its Representatives. NIC agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement with any person which directly or indirectly prohibits NIC from providing any information to Tyler in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 6.3. 


(d)          Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the contrary, but subject to Section 6.3(e), at any time prior to the NIC Stockholder Approval being obtained, the NIC Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation (only of the type contemplated by Section 6.3(a)(iv) or Section 6.3(a)(v)) in response to an Intervening Event if the NIC Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with NIC’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) make a Change of Recommendation (of the type contemplated by Section 6.3(a)(iv) or Section 6.3(a)(v)) and cause NIC to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1(h) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal received after the date of this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, did not result from a breach of Section 6.3(a)(i) or (ii) and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn) if the NIC Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with NIC’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither NIC nor any NIC Subsidiary shall enter into any NIC Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1. “Intervening Event” means any Effect that is material to NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and was not known by or the material consequences of which (based on facts known to members of the NIC Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement) were not reasonably foreseeable to NIC or the NIC Board of Directors as of or prior to the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall the following events, changes, or developments constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence, or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or communications relating thereto or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (B) changes in the market price or trading volume of the NIC Common Stock (it being understood, however, in the case of this clause (B), that any underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred), (C) changes in general economic, political, or financial conditions or markets (including changes in interest rates, exchange rates, stock, bond, or debt prices), (D) changes in GAAP, other applicable accounting rules or applicable Law or, in any such case, changes in the interpretation thereof, or (E) natural disasters, epidemics, or pandemics (including the existence and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), provided that with respect to clauses (C)-(E), except if and to the extent that such Effect has a disproportionate effect on NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other companies in the industries in which NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries operate.

(e)          Prior to NIC taking any action permitted (i) under Section 6.3(d)(i), NIC shall provide Tyler with four Business Days’ prior written notice advising Tyler that the NIC Board of Directors intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and, during such four-Business Day period (which period shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the fourth Business Day), NIC shall cause its executive officers and direct its other Representatives to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Tyler desires to negotiate) any proposal by Tyler to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation, and at the end of such four-Business Day period (which period shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the fourth Business Day) the NIC Board of Directors again makes the determination under Section 6.3(d)(i) (after in good faith taking into account any amendments to this Agreement proposed by Tyler) or (ii) under Section 6.3(d)(ii), NIC shall provide Tyler with four-Business Days’ prior written notice advising Tyler that the NIC Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of any proposed definitive documentation, and, during such four-Business Day period (which period shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the fourth Business Day), NIC shall cause its executive officers and direct its other Representatives to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Tyler desires to negotiate) any proposal by Tyler to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and at the end of such four-Business Day period (which period shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the fourth Business Day) the NIC Board of Directors again makes the determination under Section 6.3(d)(ii) (after in good faith taking into account the amendments to this Agreement proposed by Tyler). With respect to Section 6.3(e)(ii), i f there are any material amendments, revisions, or changes to the material terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any revision to the amount, form, or mix of consideration NIC Stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal), NIC shall notify Tyler of each such amendment, revision, or change in compliance with Section 6.3(c) and the applicable four-Business Day period shall be extended until at least two Business Days after the time that Tyler receives notification from NIC of each such revision, and the NIC Board of Directors shall not take any such action permitted under Section 6.3(d)(ii) prior to the end of any such period (which period shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the applicable day) as so extended in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.3(e). 


(f)          Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit NIC or the NIC Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to NIC Stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to NIC Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to NIC Stockholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if the NIC Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with NIC’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, which actions, in the case of clauses (i)-(iii), shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute a Change of Recommendation so long as any such disclosure (x) with respect to clauses (i) and (iii) only, includes an express reaffirmation of the NIC Board Recommendation, without any amendment, withdrawal, alteration, modification, or qualification thereof and (y) does not include any statement that constitutes, and does not otherwise constitute, a Change of Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.3(f) shall not permit the NIC Board of Directors to make (or otherwise modify the definition of) a Change of Recommendation except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.3(d) and Section 6.3(e). 


6.4          Preparation of the Proxy Statement; NIC Stockholders Meeting. 


(a)          As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, NIC (with Tyler’s reasonable cooperation) shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare within 30 days following the execution of this Agreement a Proxy Statement. Each of the Tyler Entities shall furnish to NIC all information as may be reasonably requested by NIC in connection with the preparation, of the Proxy Statement and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by NIC. NIC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be filed and mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by NIC, in each case, without providing Tyler with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by NIC in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable, except, in each case, to the extent such disclosure relates to an Acquisition Proposal or a Change of Recommendation. If, at any time prior to the receipt of the NIC Stockholder Approval, any information relating to Tyler or NIC or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by Tyler or NIC which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that it would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable opportunity for the other Party to review and comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to NIC Stockholders. Subject to applicable Law, NIC shall notify Tyler promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between NIC or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger.

(b)          Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, NIC shall (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act for a record date for the NIC Stockholders Meeting and (ii) duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold a meeting of NIC Stockholders for the purpose of seeking the NIC Stockholder Approval (as it may be adjourned or postponed as provided below, the “NIC Stockholders Meeting”) as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which NIC learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC has no further comments thereon, and NIC shall submit such proposal to NIC Stockholders at the NIC Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to NIC Stockholders in connection with the NIC Stockholders Meeting (other than an advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding adjournment of the NIC Stockholders Meeting and, if the NIC Stockholders Meeting is also NIC’s annual stockholder meeting, proposals customarily brought in connection with NIC’s annual stockholder meeting) without the prior written consent of Tyler (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). NIC agrees to provide Tyler with reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested, promptly providing daily voting reports in the last seven days prior to the NIC Stockholders Meeting) and to give written notice (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be given via email) to Tyler one day prior to, and on the date of, the NIC Stockholders Meeting, indicating whether, as of such date, sufficient proxies representing the requisite vote of the NIC Stockholders have been obtained. 


(c)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, NIC shall not adjourn or postpone the NIC Stockholders Meeting without Tyler’s prior written consent; provided that without Tyler’s prior written consent, NIC may make one or more successive adjournments or postponements of the NIC Stockholders Meeting (i) after consultation with Tyler, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by Law is provided to the NIC Stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the NIC Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the NIC Stockholders Meeting or to obtain the NIC Stockholder Approval, to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining a quorum or the NIC Stockholder Approval; provided that, unless agreed to in writing by Tyler, each such adjournment or postponement shall be for a period of no more than ten Business Days; provided t h at no postponement contemplated by this clause (ii) shall be permitted if it would require a change to the record date for the NIC Stockholders Meeting. Unless the NIC Board of Directors has validly made a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.3, NIC shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from NIC Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (B) take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the NIC Stockholder Approval, including by including the NIC Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) the NIC Stockholders Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the NIC Stockholders for approval at the NIC Stockholders Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve NIC of such obligation and (y) all other obligations of the Parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure, or communication to NIC of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal), except as expressly set forth herein. 


6.5          Access to Information; Notification of Certain Matters. 


(a)          For purposes of furthering the Merger but subject to Section 6.5(b), NIC shall afford to Tyler, and to Tyler’s Representatives, upon NIC’s approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) of a reasonable request by Tyler to be provided reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to NIC’s properties, books and records, financial and operating data, other information, and to those officers of NIC to whom Tyler reasonably requests access; provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted during normal business hours under the supervision of NIC’s personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of NIC; and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not permit any Tyler Entity or any such Representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling. Without limiting the other provisions of this Section 6.5, the Tyler Entities will use reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the business of NIC that may result from the requests for access, data, or information hereunder.

(b)          Notwithstanding the foregoing, NIC shall not be required by this Section 6.5 to provide Tyler or Tyler’s Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i) that, in the reasonable good-faith judgment of NIC, is prohibited from being disclosed pursuant to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a Third Party entered into prior to the date hereof or after the date hereof in the ordinary course of business (provided, however, that, at Tyler’s written request, NIC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (x) to obtain the required consent of such Third Party to such access or disclosure or (y) to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in violation of such consent requirement), (ii) the disclosure of which, in the reasonable good-faith judgment of NIC, would violate applicable Law (provided, however, that NIC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Law), (iii) the disclosure of which, in the reasonable good-faith judgment of NIC, would cause the loss of any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (provided, however, that NIC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that such access or disclosure would not jeopardize attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege) or (iv) the disclosure of which, in the reasonable good-faith judgment of NIC, would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets or other competitively sensitive information of NIC or any of NIC Subsidiary or any third parties. 


(c)          Each of NIC and Tyler will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.5, in confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.6          Reasonable Best Efforts. 


(a)          Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing or otherwise providing, in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, and (ii) taking all actions as may be necessary, subject to the limitations in this Section 6.6, to obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders, and approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten Business Days after the execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed between the Parties) and shall request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the Transactions, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary materials that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Tyler, Merger Sub, or the other Tyler Subsidiaries shall be required to, and NIC may not and may not permit any NIC Subsidiary to, without the prior written consent of Tyler, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement, or order to (A) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of any assets, business, or portion of business of NIC, the Surviving Corporation, Tyler, Merger Sub, or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing, (B) conduct, restrict, operate, invest, or otherwise change the assets, the business or portion of the business of NIC, the Surviving Corporation, Tyler, Merger Sub, or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing in any manner or (C) impose any restriction, requirement, or limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of NIC, the Surviving Corporation, Tyler, Merger Sub, or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing, in the case of each of clauses (A), (B) and (C), if any such action would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, adversely impact Tyler, NIC, or their respective Subsidiaries in a manner or amount that is material relative to the value of NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided that if requested by Tyler, NIC or its Subsidiaries will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement, or order so long as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement, or order is only binding on NIC or its Subsidiaries in the event the Closing occurs. Additionally, each of Tyler, Merger Sub and NIC shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to not take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any such Governmental Authority necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing.

The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability, indemnification, and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the NIC Governing Documents or the organizational documents of the applicable NIC Subsidiary (as applicable) or in any indemnification agreement of NIC or a NIC Subsidiary with any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement as set forth on Section 6.8(a) of the NIC Disclosure Letter and made available to Tyler prior to the date of this Agreement or filed or furnished by NIC with the SEC and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement shall survive the Transactions, including the Merger, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof, and shall not be amended, repealed o r otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person intends in good faith to seek elimination of liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Section 6.8, the provisions of this Section 6.8 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all Proceedings relating thereto.

(b)          For six years after the Effective Time, Tyler shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) NIC Governing Documents and (ii) any indemnification agreement of NIC or a NIC Subsidiary with any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement and made available to Tyler prior to the date of this Agreement or filed or furnished by NIC with the SEC and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, except to the extent that such agreement provides for an earlier termination, in each case, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors, and employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date hereof, and no such provision shall be amended, modified, or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions). 


(c)          At or prior to the Effective Time, NIC shall purchase a six-year prepaid “tail” policy on terms and conditions providing coverage retentions, limits, and other material terms substantially equivalent to the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that NIC shall not commit or spend on such “tail” policy, in the aggregate, more than 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by NIC prior to the date hereof for NIC’s current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the “Base Amount”), and if the cost of such “tail” policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, NIC shall be permitted to purchase only as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Base Amount. NIC shall in good faith cooperate with Tyler prior to the Closing with respect to the procurement of such “tail” policy, including with respect to the selection of the broker, available policy price and coverage options. 


(d)          In the event Tyler or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Tyler or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. The rights and obligations under this Section 6.8 shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.

The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions. No Change of Recommendation shall change, or be deemed to change, or permit NIC or the NIC Board of Directors to change, in any manner or respect, the approval of the NIC Board of Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions.

Tyler shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of the obligations of Merger Sub under this Agreement shall also be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Tyler.  Between the date hereof and the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Merger Sub shall not, and Tyler shall not permit Merger Sub to, engage in any activity of any nature except as provided in, expressly contemplated by, or in furtherance of the Transactions.

(c)          For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits, but expressly not for the purpose of extending the period set forth in Section 6.11(b) or the items covered therein) under the employee benefit plans of Tyler and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Continuing Employee shall, subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with NIC and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar NIC Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time (other than any administrative delays in connection with any transition to any New Plan), in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the NIC Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii)(A) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Tyler or its applicable Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) Tyler and its applicable Subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 


(d)          Without limiting Section 6.11(c), if the NIC 401(k) plan is terminated after the Effective Time, then as soon as practicable following the termination date, Tyler shall permit all Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in the NIC 401(k) plan immediately prior to the termination date to participate in Tyler’s 401(k) plan. 


(e)          Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Tyler or any Affiliate of Tyler, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Tyler or any Affiliate of Tyler, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge o r terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Tyler, NIC or any Affiliate of Tyler and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit, or other applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.11 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any NIC Plan or employee benefit plan of Tyler or Merger Sub or (ii) create any Third Party rights in any current or former service provider of NIC or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

NIC shall give Tyler the opportunity to consult (at Tyler’s expense) with NIC with respect to the defense or settlement of any such litigation, and NIC agrees that it shall not settle any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed, without Tyler’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that Tyler may, in its sole discretion, withhold such consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of Tyler and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief on NIC, Tyler, or any of their Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries). In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this Section 6.12 and Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, the provisions of this Section 6.12 shall control.

(b)          Tyler shall indemnify and hold harmless NIC, the NIC Subsidiaries, and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, except in the event such liabilities or losses arose out of or result from (i) the willful misconduct, gross negligence, or bad faith of NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, or (ii) any intentional material misstatement or omission in information provided in writing hereunder by or on behalf of NIC, the NIC Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives for use in connection with the Financing (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the “Indemnity Exceptions”). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 for any reason, Tyler shall, promptly upon request by NIC, reimburse NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs actually incurred by NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries (including those of its Representatives) in connection with taking action required or requested by Tyler pursuant to this Section 6.15, other than those arising out of or resulting from the Indemnity Exceptions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 6.15 represent the sole obligation of NIC, the NIC Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and the NIC Disclosure Letter) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. 


(c)          To the extent that any of the “Bridge Loans”, “Takeout Securities”, or “Takeout Loans” (each as defined in the Commitment Letter) are not available to Tyler and/or Merger Sub at or prior to the Closing, each of Tyler and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange and obtain proceeds of the Initial Financing in an amount that when aggregated with cash and cash equivalents on hand that is available to Tyler will be sufficient to consummate the Transactions set forth in this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter (including the “flex” provisions contained in any fee letters) or on other terms and conditions agreed by Tyler and the Financing Sources, and consented to by NIC including by using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, subject to the modifications permitted hereunder; (ii) negotiate as promptly as possible, and enter into, definitive agreements relating to the Initial Financing at or prior to the Closing (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any fee letters); (iii) satisfy (or obtain a waiver thereof) and to cause their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Tyler, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in the Commitment Letter to the extent the failure to satisfy such conditions would adversely impact the timing of the Closing or the availability at Closing of sufficient aggregate proceeds of the Initial Financing to consummate the Transactions, in each case only to the extent within their respective control; (4) assuming that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter have been satisfied or waived, cause the Initial Financing to be consummated at or prior to the Closing; and (5) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter. Tyler shall respond promptly to any requests from NIC for information on the status of Tyler’s efforts to arrange the Financing. 


(d)          Tyler and Merger Sub shall not agree to, or permit, without the prior written consent of NIC, any assignment, amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, replacement, restatement or substitution of, or any waiver by Tyler or Merger Sub of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter (including with respect to any alternative financing intended to replace or be substituted for, in whole or in part, any portion of the Financing) if such assignment, amendment, supplement, modification, replacement, restatement, substitution or waiver (1) reduces the aggregate amount of the net cash proceeds of the Financing to be funded on the Closing Date, to an amount that, when aggregated with cash and cash equivalents on hand that is available to Tyler, would be insufficient to consummate the Transactions set forth in this Agreement, (2) imposes new or additional conditions precedent or otherwise materially expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions precedent to the receipt of the Financing, in each case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Financing, or (3) adversely and materially impacts the ability of Tyler to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter with respect to the Financing; provided, that Tyler may amend, modify, assign, supplement, substitute, replace or restate the Commitment Letter to add (A) lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities, and grant customary approval rights to such additional lenders, lead arrangers, agents, managers and bookrunners, or (B) increase the aggregate amount of the Financing, subject to the foregoing clauses (1) through (3).

________________


(e)          In the event that any portion of the Initial Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter for any reason whatsoever, and such portion is necessary to permit Tyler and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions (except in accordance with the express terms set forth in the Commitment Letter or unless concurrently replaced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by commitments subject to substantially the same conditions precedent as those set forth in the Commitment Letter from the Financing Sources, or from other financing sources or from proceeds of other sources of financing or cash), then (i) Tyler shall promptly so notify NIC and (ii) Tyler and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and negotiate and enter into commitment letters and/or definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing arrangements in an amount sufficient when added to the portion of the Financing (if any) and cash on hand that is available and will be funded at or prior to the Closing, to consummate the Transactions and to pay all related fees and expenses upon terms and conditions not less favorable to NIC (solely with respect to conditionality) and that are, when taken as a whole, not materially less favorable to Tyler than those in the Commitment Letter (including the “flex” provisions contained in any fee letter), as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the Closing Date). 


(f)          As contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Tyler shall promptly seek the Proposed Amendment (as defined in the Commitment Letter) (the “Proposed Amendment”).  Tyler shall promptly inform NIC in writing of the effectiveness of the Proposed Amendment and promptly provide an executed copy thereof to NIC.  From and after the date of this Agreement until the effective date of the Proposed Amendment,  Tyler shall not incur, or permit to remain outstanding, any Loans or Letters of Credit (each as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) under the Existing Credit Agreement.  If the Proposed Amendment shall not have become effective in accordance with its terms within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, NIC shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require, by written notice, Tyler to terminate the Existing Credit Agreement, and Tyler shall promptly terminate the Existing Credit Agreement in accordance with its terms upon receipt of such notice. 


6 . 1 6          Treatment of NIC Indebtedness.  NIC shall deliver to Tyler (x) at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an executed payoff letter and (y) at the Closing, executed related release documentation, in each case, with respect to the NIC Credit Agreement (the “Payoff Letter”) in form and substance customary for transactions of this type, from the administrative agent on behalf of the lenders thereunder, which Payoff Letter together with any related release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount (which amount may be exclusive of any contingent indemnification obligations and other obligations which by their terms survive the payment in full of the principal amount of the loans under the NIC Credit Agreement) and provide that all guarantees and Liens granted in connection therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of NIC and the NIC Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness and any other obligations secured thereby, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the Payoff Letter at or prior to the Effective Time, be released and terminated. 


6 . 1 7          Section 16 Matters.  Prior to the Effective Time, Tyler and NIC shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of NIC Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to NIC Common Stock) or acquisitions of Tyler Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Tyler Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to NIC, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Tyler, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(a)          by mutual written consent of Tyler and NIC; 


(b)          by either Tyler or NIC if the Closing has not occurred on or before June 30, 2021 (as extended, the “Outside Date”); provided that if, on the Outside Date, all of the conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE VII, other than the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) (to the extent any such Restraint is in respect of, or any such Law is, the HSR Act) and those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing (but provided that such conditions shall then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to take place on such date), shall have been satisfied or waived, then the Outside Date shall automatically be extended one time for all purposes hereunder for an additional three months, which later date shall thereafter be deemed to be the Outside Date; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a proximate cause of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated by the Outside Date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement; 


(c)          by Tyler, in the event that (i) NIC shall have breached, failed to perform, or violated its covenants or agreements under this Agreement or (ii) any of the representations and warranties of NIC set forth in this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case of clause (i) or (ii) in a manner that would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) and such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, is not cured by NIC before the earlier of (x) the Business Day immediately prior to the Outside Date and (y) the 30th calendar day following receipt of written notice from Tyler of such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy; provided that Tyler shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if Tyler or Merger Sub is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b); 


(d)          by NIC, in the event that (i) Tyler or Merger Sub shall have breached, failed to perform or violated their respective covenants or agreements under this Agreement or (ii) any of the representations and warranties of Tyler or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case of clause (i) or (ii) in a manner that would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) and such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, is not cured by Tyler or Merger Sub, as applicable, before the earlier of (x) the Business Day immediately prior to the Outside Date and (y) the 30th calendar day following receipt of written notice from NIC of such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy; provided that NIC shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if NIC is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b); 


(e)          by either Tyler or NIC if any Restraint, having any of the effects set forth in Section 7.1(c), shall have become final and nonappealable and remains in effect; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure to fulfill its obligations under Section 6.6 has been a proximate cause of such Restraint or of such Restraint becoming final and nonappealable;

8.2          Effect of Termination. 


(a)          In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability on the part of the Tyler Entities or NIC, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, clause (A)(ii) of the proviso to Section 6.15(a), Section 6.15(b), this Section 8.2, and ARTICLE IX (excluding Sections 9.3 and 9.5) shall survive termination, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) “willful breach” means a material breach of this Agreement that is the result of an action or omission taken or omitted to be taken that the breaching party intentionally takes (or fails to take) and actually knows would, or would reasonably be expected to, be or cause a material breach of this Agreement; and (ii) “fraud” means common law fraud that is committed with actual knowledge of falsity and with the intent to deceive or mislead another. 


(b)          Termination Fee. 


(i)          If (A) Tyler or NIC terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(g), (B) after the date hereof and prior to the date of such termination (or prior to the NIC Stockholder Approval in the case of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(g)), a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed (whether by NIC or a Third Party), and is not publicly withdrawn at least three Business Days prior to the earlier of the date of the NIC Stockholders Meeting and the date of such termination and (C) within 12 months of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is entered into, then on or prior to the date any such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, NIC shall pay to Tyler a fee of fifty-five million dollars ($55,000,000) in cash (the “Termination Fee”). Solely for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), the term “Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Annex I, except that all references to “15%” and “85%” therein shall be deemed to be references to “50%.” 


(ii)          If Tyler terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), within two Business Days after such termination, NIC shall pay to Tyler the Termination Fee. 


(iii)          If NIC terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), substantially concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to) such termination, NIC shall pay to Tyler the Termination Fee. 


(iv)          In the event any amount is payable by NIC pursuant to the preceding subsections (i), (ii) or (iii), such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Tyler (which account shall be designated by Tyler upon request by NIC to allow NIC to pay or cause to be paid to Tyler any amounts payable hereunder within the time periods required by this Section 8.2). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall NIC be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c)          Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the Parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Each Party further acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Tyler Entities in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if NIC fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), then (i) NIC shall reimburse Tyler for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amounts, including in connection with any related Proceedings commenced and NIC shall pay to Tyler interest on the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b) from and including the date payment of such amounts were due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except the right to seek monetary damages for fraud (solely as it relates to the representations and warranties expressly made in ARTICLE IV) or for a willful breach occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant t o Section 8.1, and without limiting the Tyler Entities’ right to specific performance in accordance with Section 9.11, (A) the Termination Fee (and any other amounts expressly contemplated by this Section 8.2, if any) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to the Tyler Entities in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions in any circumstance in which the Termination Fee becomes due and payable and is paid by NIC in accordance with this Agreement, and (B) upon Tyler’s receipt of the full Termination Fee (and any other amounts contemplated by this Section 8.2) pursuant to this Section 8.2 in circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable, none of NIC, any NIC Subsidiary or any of their respective former, current, or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates, or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for the right to seek monetary damages for fraud (solely as it relates to the representations and warranties expressly made in ARTICLE IV) or for a willful breach. For the avoidance of doubt, Tyler may seek specific performance to cause NIC to consummate the Transactions in accordance with Section 9.11 and the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2, but in no event shall Tyler be entitled to both (i) specific performance to cause NIC to consummate the Transactions in accordance with Section 9.11 and (ii) the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2.

(a)          This Agreement (together with any Exhibits, Annexes, and including the NIC Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the Transactions and supersede all prior agreements, arrangements, and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Financing Source shall be an express third-party beneficiary with respect to Section  8.2(c) (Effect of Termination), this Section 9.2 (Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries), the proviso in Section 9.3(a) (Amendment and Modification; Waiver ), the last sentence of Section 9.4 (Assignment), Section 9.7(c) (Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction), Section 9.8 (Waiver of Jury Trial ), Section 9.10 (Non-Recourse), and the last sentence of Section 9.11(b) (Enforcement; Remedies) (the “FS Provisions”).

Any agreement on the part of the Tyler Entities or NIC to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Tyler or NIC, as applicable. No failure or delay by NIC, Tyler or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

9 . 9          Severability.  Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the Parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of this Agreement and the Transactions that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.  If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 


9.10          Non-Recourse.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither NIC nor any NIC Subsidiary will have any rights or claims, regardless of the legal theory under which such right or claim may be asserted, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise under any legal or equitable theory, and will not seek any such rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions, or the Financing, and no Financing Source shall have any liability to NIC nor any NIC Subsidiary for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim (regardless of the legal theory under which such claim may be asserted, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise under any legal or equitable theory), based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions, or the Financing or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 9.10 shall in any way limit or qualify (x) the rights and obligations of the Financing Sources to each other thereunder or in connection therewith or (y) the rights of NIC to make a claim against Tyler under the Confidentiality Agreement for any breach thereof by any Financing Source. 


9.11          Enforcement; Remedies. 


(a)          Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 


(b)          The Parties agree that irreparable injury, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger or the other Transactions) is not performed, or is threatened to be not performed, in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it at law or in equity, including monetary damages, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, a decree or order of specific performance specifically enforcing the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any further equitable relief, in each case in accordance with Section 9.7, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled under the terms of this Agreement.  The Parties further agree that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11(b), and each Party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall NIC or any of its Subsidiaries or equityholders be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement directly against any Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Financing. 


51








________________


(c)          The Parties’ rights in this Section 9.11 are an integral part of the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11 (including any objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11, such Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy. 


9.12          Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.  Facsimile or other electronic transmission of any signed original document or retransmission of any such signed transmission will be deemed the same as delivery of an original.  At the request of any Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile or other electronic transmission by signing a duplicate original document.

Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall represent one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time. (b) Capital Stock of the Company. (i) Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares, any Converted Shares, and Company Restricted Stock Awards, which shall be treated as set forth in Section 3.2(a)) (such shares of Company Common Stock, the “Eligible Shares”) shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent that number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Merger Consideration”). As used in this Agreement, “Exchange Ratio” means 0.050, as it may be adjusted, from time to time, pursuant to Section 3.1(c).   -5-

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i), shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Converted Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(g) and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the exchange of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.3(b). (iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, “Excluded Shares”) shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) (“Converted Shares”) shall automatically be converted into a number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. (c) Impact of Stock Splits, Etc. In the event of any change in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.1(c). Nothing in this Section 3.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement. 3.2 Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards. (a) Consideration. At and as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereto: (i) each unvested restricted share of Company Common Stock (a “Company Restricted Stock Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted on the same terms and conditions (including time-based and termination related vesting conditions) applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award under the applicable Company Stock Plan and Company Award Agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time into the right to receive a number of time-based restricted shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such unvested Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio;   -6-

(ii) each unvested award of performance share units denominated in shares of Company Common Stock (a “Company PSU Award”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted on the same terms and conditions (including time-based and termination related vesting conditions) applicable to such unvested Company PSU Award under the applicable Company Stock Plan and Company Award Agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any performance-based vesting conditions) into the right to receive a time-based restricted stock unit of Parent covering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such unvested Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time that would have been earned under the terms of such Company PSU Award based upon the higher of (1) 100% of the target level of performance and (2) actual performance, in each case, through the Closing Date (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio; (iii) any compensation deferred by a current or former employee, director or other service provider of the Company and deemed notionally invested in Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Deferred Compensation Plans, including “Deferred Shares” granted to the Company’s employees and non-employee directors pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and Company Deferred Compensation Plans (each, a “Company Notional Stock Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, except with respect to “Deferred Shares” granted to Company employees (“Employee Deferred Shares”), become 100% vested and converted into and deemed notionally invested in a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Notional Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and such deferred compensation will be paid in cash promptly following the closing and in no event later than the time set forth in the applicable Company Deferred Compensation Plan; (iv) Each award of Employee Deferred Shares that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into a number of time-based restricted shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award of Employee Deferred Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, which time-based restricted shares of Parent Common Stock will be subject to the same time-based and termination related vesting conditions as applied to the corresponding award of Employee Deferred Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (v) each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a “Company Stock Option”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, as of the Effective Time, be automatically cancelled without any payment or other consideration required to be made in respect thereof.   -7-

(b) Administration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall take such action and adopt such resolutions as are required to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company PSU Awards, Company Notional Stock Awards and Company Stock Options (collectively, the “Company Equity Awards”) pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.2, (ii) if requested by Parent in writing, cause the Company Stock Plans to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time and (iii) take all actions reasonably required to effectuate any provision of this Section 3.2, including to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any equity awards of the Company, including any Company Equity Awards. (c) Parent Actions. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to issue a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to or in settlement of the Company Equity Awards contemplated by this Section 3.2. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such awards. 3.3 Payment for Securities; Exchange. (a) Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with Parent’s or the Company’s transfer agent, or another firm reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration and cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares, pursuant to Section 3.3(h) to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Article III. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance with this Article III through the Exchange Agent, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to Section 3.1. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.3(h). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 3.3(a) and Sections 3.3(g) and 3.3(h), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(g)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. To the extent, for any reason, the amount in the Exchange Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III, Parent shall promptly replace, restore or supplement the cash in   -8-

the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III. Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. (b) Payment Procedures. (i) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Eligible Shares (“Certificates”), a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration, which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g). (ii) Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Eligible Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) not held through DTC, (A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a statement reflecting the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (C) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g). (iii) DTC Book-Entry Shares. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III.   -9-

(iv) No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Article III. (v) With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)) is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)) to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)) shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b)(v), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g). (c) Termination of Rights. All Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)) paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Eligible Shares previously represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g), without any interest thereon.   -10-

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g), in each case, without any interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts. (e) No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (f) Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent) and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g). (g) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3. Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.   -11-








________________


(h) No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending two (2) trading days prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. (the “Parent Closing Price”). As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange. (i) Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law (and to the extent such deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding may be taken in Parent Common Stock) and shall pay the amount deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as appropriate, shall provide commercially reasonable notice to the Company upon becoming aware of any such withholding obligation and shall cooperate with the Company to the extent reasonable to obtain reduction of or relief from such withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made, and, if withholding is taken in Parent Common Stock, the relevant withholding party shall be treated as having sold such Parent Common Stock on behalf of such holder of the Company Common Stock for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Taxing Authority. 3.4 No Appraisal Rights. In accordance with the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Transactions.   -12-

The Company represents and warrants to Parent that it has not taken any action that (i) would be prohibited by this Section 6.3(f) or (ii) but for the ability to avoid actions inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, would have been prohibited by this Section 6.3(f), in each case, during the sixty (60) days prior to the date of this Agreement. (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.3, any action, or failure to take action, (i) that is taken by a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of this Section 6.3 or (ii) that is taken by any other Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would have been a violation of this Section 6.3 if taken by a director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiaries, shall, in each case, be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.3 by the Company. 6.4 Preparation of the Company Proxy Statement and Registration Statement. (a) The Parties will promptly furnish to the other Party such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) and the holders of its capital stock, as the other Party may reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and information in the Company Proxy Statement or Registration Statement, as applicable, and any amendments or supplements thereto, so that the Company Proxy Statement conforms in form and substance to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Registration Statement conforms in form and substance to the requirements of the Securities Act. (b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Agreement, (i) a mutually acceptable Company Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) the Registration Statement (of which the Company Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company and Parent shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Company Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as reasonably practicable and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Company Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In addition,   -59-

each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide information concerning it necessary to enable the Company and Parent to prepare required pro forma financial statements and related footnotes in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or as otherwise required to be disclosed by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Company Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent will (i) provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) include in such document or response all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other, (iii) not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (iv) permit the other Party (in each case, to the extent practicable), and their respective outside legal counsels, to participate in all meetings and conferences with the SEC. (c) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable “blue sky” laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. (d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Company Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 6.5 Company Stockholders Meeting; Merger Sub Stockholder Approval. (a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give notice of, convene and hold (in person or virtually, in accordance with applicable Law) a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Company Proxy Statement by the SEC and the time that the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (and in any event will use commercially reasonable efforts to convene such meeting within sixty (60) days thereof). Except as permitted by Section 6.3, the Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company Board shall solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board   -60-

Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement is provided to the Company’s stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting, after consultation in good faith with Parent, if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably determines in good faith that there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than ten (10) Business Days after the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that such Company Stockholders Meeting shall only be adjourned or postponed once under the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) exist without the Parent’s written consent); and provided further that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date or if doing so would require the setting of a new record date, in each case, without Parent’s prior written consent. (b) The Company shall promptly upon receipt provide all voting tabulation reports relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by the Company or the Company’s transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or written communications from or to the Company’s stockholders with respect thereto. Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.3, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Company’s stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Company Stockholder Approval from being obtained. Once the Company has established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder. Without the prior written consent of Parent or as required by applicable Law, (i) the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than a non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger and matters of procedure) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company shall not submit any other proposal to such stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise (including any proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions) and (ii) the Company shall not call, hold or convene any meeting of the stockholders of the Company other than the Company Stockholders Meeting.   -61-

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that (i) its obligations to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation, (ii) except in the event of a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (iii) its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the commencement, announcement, disclosure, or communication to the Company of any Competing Proposal or other proposal (including a Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or disclosure of any Intervening Event. (d) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall duly approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub in accordance with applicable Law and the Organizational Documents of Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent so approving and adopting this Agreement. 6.6 Access to Information. (a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this Section 6.6, the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Company Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement, or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives, during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 8.1, reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, key employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records, Contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent and its Representatives such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries’ business, properties, Contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of Parent; provided, that such access may be limited by the Company to the extent reasonably necessary (i) for the Company to comply with any applicable COVID-19 Measures or (ii) for such access, in light of COVID-19 or COVID-19 Measures, not to jeopardize the health and safety of the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective Representatives or commercial partners (provided that, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access as can be provided (or otherwise convey such information regarding the applicable matter as can be conveyed) in a manner without risking the health and safety of such Persons or violating such COVID-19 Measures). Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) No Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information, as applicable, to the other Party or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such information, as applicable, is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing Contract (provided, however, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of   -62-

what is being withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through the use of commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party required to provide such information and (B) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the Parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege); (ii) No Party shall have access to personnel records of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information to the extent that in the other Party’s good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability; (iii) Without prior written consent, which shall be granted or withheld in such Party’s sole discretion, no Party shall be permitted to conduct any sampling (including subsurface or other invasive testing or sampling) or analysis of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of the other Party or its Subsidiaries; and (iv) no investigation or information provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein. (b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of December 8, 2020 between Parent and the Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder; provided, that paragraph 3 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be of no force and effect as of the date hereof. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, each Party shall continue to provide access to the other Party and its Representatives to the data relating to the Transactions maintained by or on behalf of it to which the other Party and its Representatives were provided access prior to the date of this Agreement. 6.7 HSR and Other Approvals. (a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to Antitrust Laws to which Sections 6.7(b) and 6.7(c), and not this Section 6.7(a), shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities and other third parties all authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in order to consummate the Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of, such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to Sections 6.7(b) and 6.7(c)), in no event shall either the Company or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be required to pay any consideration to any third parties or give anything of value to obtain any such Person’s authorization, approval, consent or waiver to effectuate the Transactions,   -63-

other than filing, recordation or similar fees. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent reasonably practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as applicable, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions (including the Company Proxy Statement). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals, permits, expirations of waiting periods or authorizations in connection with the Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent, subject to Section 6.7(b), may be withheld in Parent’s sole discretion). (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall make any filings required under the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for information from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating the HSR Act or any other Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of mergers, monopolization, restraining trade, lessening of competition or abusing a dominant position (collectively, “Antitrust Laws”), including the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any state of the United States, or any other competition authority of any jurisdiction (“Antitrust Authority”). Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from any Antitrust Authority. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall take any and all action necessary, including but not limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets; provided, however, that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company or Parent, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger) (each a “Divestiture Action”) to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the End Date; provided, further, however, that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to take (and the Company shall not take or agree to take) any   -64-

Divestiture Action or other action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time (but, for purposes of determining whether any effect is material, calculated as if Parent and its Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time were collectively the same size as Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), taken as a whole (a “Regulatory Material Adverse Effect”). Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 6.7, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent to take or agree to take any Divestiture Action or other action (other than de minimis actions) with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries (from and after the Effective Time)). The Company shall agree to take any Divestiture Action requested by Parent if such actions are only effective after the Effective Time and conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions. In the event that any Divestiture Action is proposed by or acceptable to a Governmental Entity, Parent shall have the right to determine the manner in which to implement the requirement of such Governmental Entity; provided, that in no event shall Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) be required to take or effect any such action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions; provided, further, that Parent shall consult with the Company and give consideration to the views of the Company on all matters relating to any possible Divestiture Action. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent shall take such action, including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or resolve such action (provided, that in no event shall this Section 6.7(b) require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture Action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect). Parent shall be entitled to direct any Proceedings with any Antitrust Authority or other Person relating to any of the foregoing, provided, however, that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein. In addition, subject to the terms of this Section 6.7, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Proceeding that would make consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall take promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End Date (provided, that in no event shall this Section 6.7(b) require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture Action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect). The Parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this Section 6.7(b) so as to preserve any applicable privilege. Parent shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws. (c) Parent (except as set forth on Schedule 6.7(c)) and Merger Sub shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay in any material respect the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.   -65-

6.8 Employee Matters. (a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (each a “Company Employee” and collectively, the “Company Employees”) (i) a salary or wage (including location premiums), that is no less favorable than the salary or wage (including location premiums) that was provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) welfare and retirement benefits and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the welfare and retirement benefits and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries. At the same time as annual long-term incentive awards are next granted following the Closing to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries generally, Parent agrees to grant to each Company Employee who is then employed with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and who was eligible to receive long-term incentive awards under the plans and policies of the Company prior to the Closing, a long-term incentive award with a grant date value equal to 150% of the value of the full, non-prorated long-term incentive award for 2021 such Covered Employee would have otherwise received from the Company, which grant shall be in such form(s) and on such terms and conditions as are no less favorable than the 2021 long-term incentive awards granted by Parent to Parent’s (and its Subsidiaries’) other similarly situated employees. (b) For purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and calculation of paid time off accruals or severance benefit entitlements (but not for purposes of defined benefit pension accrual or post-employment retiree welfare benefits) with respect to the benefit plans, programs, arrangements, policies and practices maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Closing Date, each Company Employee’s years of service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer of an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent service with such predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement) prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent (i) that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service or (ii) that such service is not recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under any applicable Company Plan in which the Company Employee was eligible to participate prior to the Effective Time. Parent will or will cause its applicable Affiliate to pay to each Company Employee in cash any paid time off accruals that exist as of the as of the Closing Date with respect to such Company Employee (taking into account the foregoing service crediting provisions), upon his or her termination of employment for any reason, less any paid time off actually taken after the Closing Date, in accordance with the Company’s paid time off policies in effect as of the Closing. The foregoing shall not limit any Company Employee’s right to receive payment upon termination of employment for any paid time off that he or she may accrue under the Surviving Corporation’s or Parent’s paid time off policies, as applicable, from and after the Closing. (c) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage of any Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health and welfare Parent   -66-

Plan to the extent such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents are covered under a Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and such conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such Company Plan and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which payment has been made, in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan provider. (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to assume and honor their respective obligations under all Company Plans listed on Schedule 6.8(d), and all benefits and compensation arrangements that are implemented in connection with the Transactions as permitted under Schedule 6.1(b)(xi) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent acknowledges that the Transactions will result in a “change in control” for purposes of all applicable Company Plans. (e) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall adopt resolutions and take all such corporate action as is necessary to terminate each 401(k) plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company 401(k) Plans”), in each case, effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plans have been properly terminated, the form of such termination documents shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. To the extent the Company 401(k) Plans are terminated pursuant to Parent’s request, the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, and such Company Employee shall be entitled to effect a direct rollover of any eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code), including any outstanding loans, to such 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries. (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any third-party beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.8) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (i) from amending or terminating any of their respective Employee Benefit Plans or, after the Effective Time, any Company Plan in accordance with their terms or (ii) after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Company Employee.   -67-

6.9 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. (a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer, or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Plan, in each case, when acting in such capacity (the “Indemnified Persons”) against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Plan or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise, as applicable, or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to or at, but not after, the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (“Indemnified Liabilities”), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent such Person is entitled to indemnification (including an advance of expenses) by the Company as of the date hereof (whether pursuant to the Company’s Organizational Documents, Contract or under applicable Law). Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.9, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.9 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such Party’s position with respect to such claims). (b) Any amendment, repeal or other modification of any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement in respect of Indemnified Liabilities shall not be enforceable against the Indemnified Persons, except to the extent required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law, shall be prospective only, shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any claim or action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment, repeal or modification, and shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the rights of Indemnified Persons in respect of Indemnified Liabilities. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents existing and in effect prior to the date of this Agreement. (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time (the “Tail Period”) from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to, but not after, the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the D&O Insurance exceed during the Tail Period 400 % of the current aggregate   -68-

(b) Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries may, in its sole and absolute discretion, but shall have no obligation to, (i) commence any of the following: (A) one or more offers to purchase any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the Indenture for cash (the “Offers to Purchase”) or (B) one or more offers to exchange any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the Indenture for securities issued by Parent or any of its Affiliates (the “Offers to Exchange”), (ii) solicit the consent of the holders of debt issued under the Indenture regarding certain amendments to the Indenture (the “Consent Solicitations”) and (iii) deliver a notice of optional redemption to the holders of debt issued under the Indenture (together with the Offers to Purchase, and Offers to Exchange and Consent Solicitations, if any, the “Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations”); provided that the closing of any such transaction shall be conditioned on the occurrence of, and shall not be consummated earlier than, the Closing (other than the closing of one or more supplemental indentures so long as the amendments effected by such supplemental indentures shall not become effective until the Closing) and any such transaction shall be funded solely using consideration provided by Parent. Subject to Section 6.2, Parent or one or more of its Affiliates may, in its sole and absolute discretion, commence or consummate an offering of securities issued by Parent or any of its Affiliates, the proceeds of which may be used to refinance existing Indebtedness of the Parent, its Affiliates and the Company (such transaction, together with the Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, the “Notes Transactions”). Any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations shall be made on such terms and conditions (including price to be paid and conditionality) as are proposed by Parent and which are permitted by the terms of the Indenture and applicable Laws, including SEC rules and regulations. Parent shall consult with the Company regarding the material terms and conditions of any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, including the timing and commencement of any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations and any tender deadlines.

The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their Affiliates and Representatives to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide, on a timely basis, all reasonable cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing to assist Parent in connection with the Notes Transactions (including, but not limited to, delivery of officers’ certificates and similar   -72-

The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations will be selected by Parent, retained by Parent, and their fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid directly by Parent. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries discovers any information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other Party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated to the holders of the applicable notes, debentures or other debt securities of the Company outstanding under the Indenture. (c) Except as a result of fraud or willful misconduct by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives, or arising from a material misstatement contained in information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries provided in writing by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives for inclusion in the Debt Offer Documents, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, penalties (excluding prepayment premiums), fines, taxes, costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of one outside legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts, consultants and other advisors, and the costs of all filing fees and printing costs) actually suffered or incurred by them in connection with any cooperation provided by the Company under this Section 6.16 and any information utilized in connection therewith. In addition, Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees, costs and expenses of outside legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts, consultants and other advisors, and the costs of all filing fees and printing costs) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in connection with any cooperation provided by the Company under this Section 6.16. This Section 6.16(c) shall survive the Closing and any termination of this Agreement, regardless of whether or not the Merger is consummated, and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries, who are each third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.16(c). (d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 6.16 to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.16 shall require (i) any cooperation to the extent that it would, in the good faith determination of the Company, unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any instrument or contract, or agree to any change or modification to any instrument or contract or take any action with respect to its existing Indebtedness prior to the occurrence of the Closing that   -73-

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their obligations to consummate the Transactions are not conditioned on the consummation of any Company Note Offer and Consent; provided, that the Company’s failure to perform its agreements and obligations under this Section 6.16 could still result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(b) to be satisfied. 6.17 Tax Matters. (a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will (and will cause its respective Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take or knowingly fail to take (and will cause its Subsidiaries not to take or knowingly fail to take) any actions that would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying, as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. (b) The Parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and agrees that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes the Merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to report the Merger in accordance with the foregoing.   -74-

None of the Parties will take any action that would cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Transactions from the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the Transactions. 6.19 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub, prior to the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation, following the Effective Time, to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement. 6.20 Asset Dispositions.

Except as a result of fraud or willful misconduct by the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives, or arising from a material misstatement contained in such information and documentation, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, penalties (excluding prepayment premiums), fines, taxes, costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of one outside legal counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts, consultants and other advisors, and the costs of all filing fees and printing costs) actually suffered or incurred by them in connection with any cooperation provided by the Company under this Section 6.20.

It is understood and agreed that with respect to the preceding clause (i) and (ii), any reference in the definition of Competing Proposal to “ten percent (10%)” shall be deemed to be a reference to “fifty percent (50%)”. (e) In no event shall Parent be entitled to receive more than one payment of the Company Termination Fee or more than one payment of Parent Expense Amount. If Parent receives the Company Termination Fee, then Parent will not be entitled to also receive a payment of the Parent Expense Amount; upon payment of any Company Termination Fee, any previously paid Parent Expense Amount shall be credited against the amount of the Company Termination Fee The Company agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement and (ii) the payments contemplated by this Section 8.3 are intended to compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due by it pursuant to this Section 8.3, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant   -80-

Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. If prior to the End Date, any Party hereto brings an action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by such other time period established by the court presiding over such action. 9.12 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by law would require the further approval by such stockholders without first obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. 9.13 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Party hereunder; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other Party contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

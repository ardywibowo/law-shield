Subject to Section 2.1(d), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Excluded Company Common Stock) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive nineteen dollars and thirty cents ($19.30) in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). As a result of the Merger, all shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as shares of Company Common Stock, and each evidence of shares in book-entry form previously evidencing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate previously representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company Common Stock Certificates”) shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

(c)           Treatment of Parent Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall following the Merger be converted into and become a share of the Surviving Company, held by the same holder of such share prior to the Merger.   (d)           Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of outstanding Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration and the Company OP Common Unit Payment Amount shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided, that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to effect any such change that it is not authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

Each Company OP Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time owned by a holder of Company OP Common Units other than the Company (each such holder, a “Company OP Minority Partner”) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive nineteen dollars and thirty cents ($19.30) in cash (the “Company OP Common Unit Payment Amount”). As a result of the Partnership Merger, all Company OP Common Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time owned by a Company OP Minority Partner shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each evidence of such Company OP Common Units in book-entry form previously evidencing such Company OP Common Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (the “Company Book-Entry OP Common Units”) and each certificate previously representing such Company OP Common Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (the “Company OP Common Unit Certificates”) shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Company OP Common Unit Payment Amount in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

 Section 2.3             Exchange of Certificates.   (a)            Exchange Agent. At or immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of the Company Certificates and the Company Book-Entry Securities, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Company OP Common Unit Payment Amount and Company OP Series A Preferred Unit Payment Amount issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.2(c) and Section 2.2(d) in exchange for such Company Certificates and Company Book-Entry Securities. Such cash so deposited is hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” Funds made available to the Exchange Agent shall, if Parent so elects, be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, pending payment thereof by the Exchange Agent to the holders of the Company Certificates and the Company Book-Entry Securities in accordance with this Article II; provided that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments required by this Article II.   (b)           Exchange Procedures.   (i)            As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of one or more Company Certificates as of immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, (A) a letter of transmittal (a “Letter of Transmittal”), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and are reasonably acceptable to the Company, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the cash consideration issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.2(c) and Section 2.2(d).   


10 


  (ii)           Upon surrender of a Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash consideration formerly represented by such Company Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, to be mailed, made available for collection by hand or delivered by wire transfer, within five (5) Business Days following the later to occur of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the Exchange Agent’s receipt of such Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Company Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the cash consideration as expressly set forth in this Article II.   (iii)          As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue to each holder of Company Book-Entry Securities as of immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time the aggregate cash consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of such Company Book-Entry Securities pursuant to this Article II, in each case, automatically without any action on the part of such holder or delivery of any certificate, Letter of Transmittal or other evidence to the Exchange Agent, and such Company Book-Entry Securities shall have been cancelled in accordance with this Article II.   (iv)          In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock, Company OP Common Units or Company OP Series A Units held by Company OP Minority Partners or Company OP Preferred Partners that is not registered in the transfer records of Company or Company OP, as applicable, it shall be a condition of payment that any Company Certificate surrendered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, or any Company Book-Entry Securities shall be properly transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any Transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered or Company Book-Entry Securities properly transferred, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Transfer Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of (A) holders of the Company Certificate on the consideration otherwise payable upon the surrender of the Company Certificate pursuant to this Article II or (B) Company Book-Entry Securities on the consideration otherwise payable in respect of such shares pursuant to this Article II.   


11 


  (c)            No Further Ownership Rights. The cash consideration issued upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock, Company OP Common Units or Company OP Series A Preferred Units shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, Company OP Common Units or Company OP Series A Preferred Units, respectively, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Parent or the Surviving Company of the shares of Company Common Stock or on the unit transfer books of Company OP of the Company OP Common Units held by Company OP Minority Partners and the Company OP Series A Preferred Units held by Company OP Preferred Partners that were outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time or the Effective Time, as applicable. If, after the Partnership Merger Effective Time or the Effective Time, as applicable, Company Certificates that were outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time or the Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (d)            Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock (whose such shares are entitled to be exchanged for cash consideration in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Article II) and the holders of Company OP Common Units and Company OP Series A Preferred Units (whose units are entitled to be exchanged for cash consideration in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Article II and have not thereto complied with the requirements of this Article II) after the date that is twelve (12) months following of the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any such former holders of shares of Company Common Stock or any former holder of Company OP Common Units or Company OP Series A Preferred Units shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of their claim for Company Common Stock, Company OP Common Units or Company OP Series A Preferred Units, as applicable.

  (f)           Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may, subject to compliance with this Section 5.3(f), make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(h) in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a Company Superior Proposal, subject to paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3, if, and only if, prior to taking such action, (i) an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal (that did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.3) is made to the Company by a third Person, (ii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary or statutory duties under applicable Law, (iv) the Company has given Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, any such Company Takeover Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action and the Company has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Company Takeover Proposal and a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements (it being understood that any amendment to any material term of such Company Takeover Proposal and shall require a new written notice and new notice period, except that the four (4) Business Day period referred to in this clause shall instead be equal to the longer of (x) two (2) Business Days or (y) the period remaining under the original four (4) Business Day notice period immediately prior to the delivery of the new written notice), (v) during such notice period, the Company Board has considered and, at the reasonable request of Parent, caused the Company to engage in good faith discussions regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and (vi) at the end of such notice period, the Company Board again has determined, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel and taking into account any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary or statutory duties under applicable Law.   (g)          Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) from making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change).   (h)          Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit (A) the Company, or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, from informing any Person of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3, or (B) the Company and its Representatives from contacting any Persons or group of Persons that have made a Company Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Company Takeover Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Superior Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 5.3.

  Section 5.4            Filings; Other Actions.   (a)          As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC (and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such filing to be made within twenty (20) Business Days of the date hereof). Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the parties shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates (including, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub) and any transaction any of them have or are contemplating entering into in connection with this Agreement that is necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in the connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. The parties shall respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC. Each party shall notify the other party promptly of the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply the other party with copies of all correspondence between such party and any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (including any preliminary Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto) or any other documents related to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto), any other documents related to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or response, and (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company, as applicable, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by the parties with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.   (b)          The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, all action necessary to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders’ Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Clearance Date, for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date to be used as the record date and the timing of any “broker search” required under Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company Stockholder Approval shall be the only matter (other than procedure matters and executive compensation matters related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company stockholders at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its stockholders as of the record date established for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Company is informed that the SEC has no further comments with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement (such date, the “Clearance Date”). Unless the Company shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.3, the Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall solicit the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.   


48 


  (c)           The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis by providing reasonably detailed updates regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (i) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the Company Stockholders’ Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, (iii) with the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or (iv) to the extent the Company is obligated to do so under applicable Law; provided, that, except as required by Law, the Company Stockholders’ Meeting shall not be recessed, adjourned or postponed in accordance with the foregoing on more than two (2) separate occasions and shall not be recessed, adjourned or postponed by more than ten (10) Business Days on any such occasion without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, further, that, except as required by Law, in no case shall the Company Stockholders’ Meeting be recessed, adjourned or postponed to a date on or after the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the End Date. In the event that the date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise consented in writing (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it shall use reasonable best efforts to implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new record date for the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by applicable Law.   Section 5.5            Employee Matters.   (a)           For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company, to provide to each individual who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company Employee”), for so long as such Company Employee continues employment with Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) following the Effective Time (and in the case of clause (iv), for the applicable period following termination of such Company Employee’s employment), (i) base salary or wages at a rate that is no less favorable than the rate of base salary or wages provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable in amount than the annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) an annual long-term incentive award opportunity based on grant date fair value that are no less favorable than the grant date fair value of the annual long-term incentive award opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) other compensation and benefits (other than severance) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the other compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the Surviving Company to honor, the terms of the Company’s Employee Change of Control Severance Protection Plan (as amended) and Executive Change of Control Severance Protection Plan (as amended).

(f)             The “Parent Termination Fee” shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Parent Base Amount and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to the Company without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the “REIT Requirements”) for such year determined as if (A) the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (B) the Company has 0.5% of its gross income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of the Company which was not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by independent accountants to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company receives Tax Guidance providing that the Company’s receipt of the Parent Base Amount should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Parent Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Parent Base Amount and Parent shall, upon receiving notice that the Company has received the Tax Guidance, pay to the Company the unpaid Parent Base Amount within five (5) Business Days. In the event that the Company is not able to receive the full Parent Base Amount due to the above limitations, Parent shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three (3) days of the date when the Parent Termination Fee would otherwise be due but for the above limitations and shall not release any portion thereof to the Company unless and until the Company receives either one or a combination of the following once or more often: (x) a letter from the Company’s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (y) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events Parent shall pay to the Company the lesser of the unpaid Parent Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (x) above within five (5) Business Days after Parent has been notified thereof. The obligation of Parent to pay any unpaid portion of the Parent Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years from the date the Parent Termination Fee first becomes payable under Section 7.3(c). Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee terminates shall be released to Parent. “Qualifying Income” shall mean income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)–(I) and 856(c)(3)(A)–(I) of the Code. “Tax Guidance” shall mean an opinion from nationally recognized federal income tax counsel experienced in REIT tax matters or a ruling from the IRS. The “Parent Base Amount” shall mean a cash amount equal to one hundred ninety six million dollars ($196,000,000). Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance (if any) reasonably requested by the Company with respect to obtaining Tax Guidance, at the Company’s sole expense, provided that Parent shall not be required to provide any Tax Guidance.

(b)            Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the courts of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland and/or the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division (the “Chosen Courts”). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Chosen Courts.

Section 8.5            Specific Enforcement.   (a)            The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly (i) the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, (ii) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. In circumstances where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Mergers and the Mergers have not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that the Company, Company OP and the Company’s stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate the Company, Company OP and the Company’s stockholders, and that the Company on behalf of itself and its stockholders and Company OP shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) specific enforcement of Parent’s and Merger Sub obligations to consummate the Mergers. The Company’s or Company OP’s pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which the Company or Company OP may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the Company, Company OP and the Company’s stockholders, subject to Section 7.3(g).

  (b)            Notwithstanding Section 8.5(a) or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and Company OP shall not be entitled to seek to enforce specifically Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless (i) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and that are then capable of being satisfied if there were a Closing) shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permissible under applicable Law) waived, (ii) the full amount of the JV Sale Transaction and the Debt Financing has been funded or would be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing were funded at the Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to this Agreement and (iv) the Company has confirmed in writing that, if specific performance is granted and the JV Sale Transaction, Debt Financing and the Equity Financing are funded, the Company will consummate the Closing pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) under no circumstances shall the Company or Company OP be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee and (B) under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and payment of the Company Termination Fee. Furthermore, for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.5(b) shall not limit the Company’s or Company OP’s ability to seek specific performance of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations pursuant to Section 5.11, or to seek specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Mergers if the full amount of the Debt Financing has been funded or would be funded at the Closing.   Section 8.6             WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES THEREUNDER OR RELATED THERETO).

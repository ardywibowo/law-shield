Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) when a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, that reference is to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) references to “paragraphs” or “clauses” are to separate paragraphs or clauses of the Section or subsection in which the reference occurs. 


(b)    Hereof, Including, etc. When used in this Agreement, (i) the words “hereof,” “herein” and “herewith” and words of similar import will, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; and (ii) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed in each case to be followed by the words “without limitation.” 


(c)    Threats. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, the word “threat” or “threatened” will be deemed to be immediately followed by the words “in writing.” 


(d)    Neither, etc. Not Exclusive. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, “neither,” “nor,” “any,” “either” and “or” are not exclusive.

All amounts in this Agreement will be paid in Dollars, and if any amounts, costs, fees or expenses incurred by any Party pursuant to this Agreement are denominated in a currency other than Dollars, to the extent applicable, the Dollar equivalent for such costs, fees and expenses will be determined by converting such other currency to Dollars at the foreign exchange rates published by Bloomberg or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source reasonably determined by the Company, in effect at the time such amount, cost, fee or expense is incurred. If the resulting conversion yields a number that extends beyond two decimal points, it will be rounded to the nearest penny.   -20-

Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9. 


(ii)    Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal.

(i)     Vested Company Equity-Based Awards. Each Vested Company Equity-Based Award shall be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Equity- Based Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Vested Company Equity-Based Award Consideration”). The payment of the Vested Company Equity-Based Award Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes. 


(ii)    Unvested Company Equity-Based Awards. Each Unvested Company Equity-Based Award shall be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Equity- Based Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award Amounts”), which Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award Amounts will, subject to the holder’s continued service with the Parent and its Representatives through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Equity-Based Awards for which such Cash Replacement Equity-Based Award Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan; provided that, with respect to any Company Equity-Based Award subject to performance vesting based on the achievement of performance metrics (each a “Company Performance Award”) that remains outstanding and subject to such performance vesting conditions as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance metrics of such Company Performance Award will be deemed achieved at the applicable level of achievement set forth on Schedule 2.8(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and the corresponding Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award shall be subject to such terms and conditions as set forth in Schedule 2.8(a)(ii). Except as provided in the prior sentence, all Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award Amounts will have the same terms and conditions as applied to the Unvested Company Equity-Based Awards for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent or its Representatives are appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award Amounts.   -27-

(i)    Vested Company Options. Each Vested Company Option will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Vested Company Option) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Vested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Vested Company Option Consideration”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Vested Company Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Vested Company Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Vested Company Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payment of the Vested Option Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes. 


(ii)    Unvested Company Options. Each Unvested Company Option shall be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Unvested Company Option) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Unvested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cash Replacement Option Amount”), which Cash Replacement Option Amount will, subject to the holder’s continued service with the Parent and its Representatives through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option for which such Cash Replacement Option Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan). All Cash Replacement Option Amounts will have the same terms and conditions as applied to the award of Unvested Company Options for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of Parent or its Representatives are appropriate to conform the administration of the Cash Replacement Option Amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Unvested Company Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Unvested Company Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Unvested Company Options will be cancelled without any Cash Replacement Option Amount being paid in respect thereof.

(d)    Necessary Further Actions. The Company will take all action reasonably necessary to effect the cancellation of Company Equity-Based Awards and Company Options as of the Effective Time, to provide for the grant of the Cash Replacement Company Equity-Based Award Amounts and the Cash Replacement Option Amounts, as applicable, and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b 3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). Subject to obtaining any required consents from the holders thereof, all Company Equity-Based Awards and all Company Equity Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time. 


(e)    Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause the offering period or purchase period under the ESPP that is in effect on the date of the Agreement to be the final offering period or purchase period under the ESPP and to be terminated no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (D) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP upon or after the date of this Agreement. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP and no further rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent. 


(b)    Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.

Any interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. 


(c)    Exchange and Payment Procedures. (i)    Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within one Business Day), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.   -30-

(ii)    Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” or such other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a). 


(d)    DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date. 


(e)    Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer   -31-








________________


Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered. 


(f)    Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 


(g)    Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. 


2.10    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 


2.11    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of   -32-








________________


an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 


2.12    Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any applicable Laws related to Taxes. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. 


2.13    Future Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. 


2.14    Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

The Company (a) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and (b) has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do   -33-








________________


business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties and assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of “good standing” is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Bylaws, each as amended to date. The Company is not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws. 


3.2    Corporate Power; Enforceability. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement and any Transaction Document to which it is a party; (b) perform its covenants and obligations under this Agreement and any Transaction Document to which it is a party; and (c) subject to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, consummate the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Transaction Document to which it is a party by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger have each been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Transaction Document to which it is a party by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement or any Transaction Document to which it is a party; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors’ rights generally; and (B) is subject to general principles of equity (collectively, the “Enforceability Limitations”). Except for the Requisite Stockholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 


3.3    Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws. (a)    Company Board Approval.

The Company Board has received the oral opinion of the Company Financial Advisor, to be confirmed by the delivery of its written opinion dated July 25, 2021, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, and limitations, qualifications and other matters considered in connection with the preparation of such opinion, the Per Share Price to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders (it being understood and agreed that such opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub). 


(c)    Anti-Takeover Laws. Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar applicable “anti-takeover” Law will not be applicable to the Merger. 


3.4    Requisite Stockholder Approval. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote to adopt this Agreement (the “Requisite Stockholder Approval”) is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law, the Charter or the Bylaws to consummate the Merger. 


3.5    Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger do not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the Charter or the Bylaws or the equivalent organizational or governing documents of any “significant subsidiary” of the Company (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC); (b) violate, conflict with, result in the breach of, constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) pursuant to, result in the termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration pursuant to any Material Contract; (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.6 and, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound; or (d) result in the creation of any lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or liens that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.10    Company Financial Statements; Internal Controls; Indebtedness. (a)    Company Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries filed with the Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or as otherwise permitted by Form 10-Q with respect to any financial statements filed on Form 10-Q); and (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows and stockholders’ equity for the periods then ended. Except as have been described in the Company SEC Reports, there are no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of the type required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. 


(b)    Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company has established and maintains, and has at all times since the Lookback Date maintained, “disclosure controls and procedures” and “internal control over financial reporting” (in each case as defined pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act). The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i) material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, and such assessment concluded that such system was effective. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021. Since January 31, 2021, and through the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, no events have occurred such that management would not be able to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, and conclude, after such assessment, that such system was effective. Since the Lookback Date, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have each made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications. 


(c)    Internal Controls. The Company has established and maintains, and at all times since the Lookback Date has maintained, a system of internal accounting controls that are effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of   -39-

5.3    Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals. (a)    Go-Shop Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until 12:01 a.m. on September 4, 2021 (the “No-Shop Period Start Date”), the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives will have the right, acting pursuant to the direction of the Company Board (or a committee thereof), to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, propose, induce or encourage the making, submission or announcement of one or more Acquisition Proposals from any Person or its Representatives, and encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal, inquiry or offer that would constitute, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, including by (A) furnishing to any Person or its Representatives any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by affording to any Person or its Representatives access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to the personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; and (B) granting a waiver, amendment or release under any “standstill” or confidentiality agreement to the extent that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof); (ii) continue, enter into, participate in or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Persons or its Representatives with respect to one or more Acquisition Proposals or any other proposals that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) otherwise cooperate with, assist or take any action to facilitate any Acquisition Proposals or any other proposals that could lead to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company will promptly (and in any event within forty eight (48) hours) make available to Parent and its Representatives any non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) that was not previously made available to Parent. The Company shall give notice to Parent of entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (other than an Existing Confidentiality Agreement) within 48 hours after the execution thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, any confidentiality agreement in effect with any Person or Group as of the date of this Agreement (an “Existing Confidentiality Agreement”) will be deemed to be an Acceptable Confidential Agreement without any need for the Company to offer to modify the Confidentiality Agreement as provided in the definition of Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. 


(b)    No Solicitation or Negotiation after the No-Shop Period Start Date. Subject to Section 5.3(c), during the period commencing with the No-Shop Period Start Date and continuing during the remainder of Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and directors, and will instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its other Representatives to, (A) cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room access (or other access to diligence) of, any Person (other than any Excluded Party, but only for so long as such Person is and remains an Excluded Party) and its Representatives relating to an Acquisition Transaction that would otherwise be prohibited by this Section 5.3(b); and (B) deliver a written notice to each Person with whom discussions and negotiations are continuing as of the No-Shop Period Start Date (other than any Excluded Party, but only for so long as such Person is and remains an Excluded Party) to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal effective on and from the   -62-

No-Shop Period Start Date. Unless the Company has already so requested, promptly following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company will request that each Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Transaction promptly return or destroy, in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, all non-public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(c) during the period commencing with the No-Shop Period Start Date and continuing during the remainder of Pre-Closing Period, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective directors and executive officers, will not, and the Company will not authorize or direct any of its or its Subsidiaries’ employees, consultants or other Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees) any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees), in any such case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to the making of an Acquisition Proposal (other than only informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3); (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”); or (vi) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. Following the No-Shop Period Start Dates, the Company will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of any “standstill” or confidentiality agreement to the extent that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof) if the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 


(c)    Conduct Related to Certain Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Section 5.3, from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Company’s receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their Representatives (including the Company Financial Advisor), following the execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (ii) furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to; (iii) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to; or (iv) otherwise facilitate the making of a Superior Proposal by, in each case, (A) any Excluded Party or its Representatives or (B) any Person or its   -63-

During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and in any event within forty eight (48) hours) make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Excluded Party or its Representatives or such Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 5.3(a) with respect to any Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended proposal or offer submitted by an Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the restrictions in Section 5.3(b) will not apply with respect thereto.

(2)    prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives, during such Event Notice Period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; (B) taken into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents proposed by Parent and other information provided by Parent in response to the notice described in clause (A) of this Section 5.3(e)(i), in each case, that are offered in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the Event Notice Period, in a manner that would constitute a binding agreement between the parties if accepted by the Company; (C) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation) and (D) following such Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents) has determined that the failure of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make a Company Board   -65-

(ii)    if the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:

Such notice must include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal, inquiry, request or offer (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group that is in effect on the date of this Agreement); and (B) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if writing, a copy thereof. Within one Business Day following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice setting forth (A) the identity of each Excluded Party (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Excluded Party that is in effect on the date of this Agreement) and (B) the material terms and conditions of any pending Acquisition Proposal made by any Excluded Party that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) is still considering.

receipt of the Financing or any other terms to the Financing in a manner that, in each case, would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.

(b)    Taking of Necessary Actions. (i)    Equity Financing not a Closing Condition. Guarantor, Parent and the Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that funding of the Equity Financing is not a condition to the Closing or the enforcement of the Guaranty. If the Equity Financing has not been funded, Parent and the Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Mergers, including by taking the actions required to be taken by Parent and the Merger Subs pursuant to Section 6.5(b)(ii).

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub must give the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any oral or written notice or communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or such definitive agreements; or (2) dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing and (C), if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent will provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event with two Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent. Parent will (and will cause the Financing Sources and the Guarantor to) provide the Company and its Representatives with such access to Parent, the Financing Sources and the Guarantor as the Company and its Representatives may reasonably request for the purpose of allowing the Company and its Representatives to understand the status of Parent’s efforts to arrange the Financing. 


(d)    Alternate Debt Financing. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, if any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the “flex” provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, then Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) alternative financing from the same or alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the “Alternate Debt Financing”); and (ii) one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the “New Debt Commitment Letters”), in each   -76-

Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which may be delivered with the fee amounts and “flex” terms redacted in a customary manner so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination of the Alternate Debt Financing) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing Letters,” “Fee Letters” or the “Debt Commitment Letters” will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters and Fee Letters, as applicable, to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters or Fee Letters, as applicable, to the extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing” or the “Debt Financing” will mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such information to any Financing Sources or prospective financing sources and other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) subject to customary confidentiality obligations.   -79-

(e)    Reimbursement. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.6. 


(f)    Indemnification. The Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives will be indemnified and held harmless by Parent from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith, except with respect to any losses suffered or incurred as a result of (i) the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Representatives or (ii) material breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of this Section 6.6. Parent’s obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(e) and this Section 6.6(f) are referred to collectively as the “Reimbursement Obligations.” 


(g)    No Financing Condition. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. Subject to Section 9.10(b)(ii), if the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company will have the option of having an appropriate senior officer of the Company provide any solvency certificate required or requested to be provided by any of the Financing Sources in connection with the Closing or otherwise. 


6.7    Anti-Takeover Laws. Neither Parent nor the Company will take any action that would cause any “takeover” Law to become applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, and each of Parent, the Company and the Company Board will (a) take all actions within their power to ensure that no “anti-takeover” Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any “anti-takeover” Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger. 


6.8    Access. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, Contracts, books and records and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney- client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would materially violate or cause a material default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third Persons; or (e)   -80-

such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand, it being understood that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents, and use commercially reasonably efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Nothing in this Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures, health and safety measures, and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform any “invasive” testing or soil, air or groundwater sampling, including any Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may satisfy its obligations set forth above by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under applicable Law as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must be directed to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer or another person designated in writing by the Company. 


6.9    Section 16(b) Exemption. The Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b 3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 


6.10    Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance. (a)    Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to), for a period of six years after the Effective Time, honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees (and any person who becomes a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) set forth on Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter or that use the same form in all material respects as the form of indemnification agreement filed with the SEC Reports. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and   -81-








________________


advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period or such period in which an Indemnified Person is asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.10(b), whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except as required by applicable Law. 


(b)    Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent provided in the applicable organizational document or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries’ in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the connection with of such Legal Proceeding of the type contemplated by this Section 6.10(b), (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time; and (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) to the extent that an Indemnified Person has such right as of the date of this Agreement and upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification   -82-








________________


may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation. 


(c)    D&O Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid “tail” policy (the “Tail Policy”) with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for the Tail Policy does not exceed 300 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year, it being understood that if the aggregate cost would exceed that limit, the Company shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable up to such limit. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect. 


(d)    Successors and Assigns. Proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10 if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person. 


(e)    No Impairment; Third Person Beneficiary Rights. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law. 


(f)    Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.10 are joint and several.   -83-








________________


(g)    Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements. 


6.11    Employee Matters. (a)    Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans made available to Parent in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law. 


(b)    Employment; Benefits. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all Continuing Employees. For the one-year period beginning on the Effective Time, or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the Continuing Employee (“Benefits Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Company Benefit Plans (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based incentive compensation, defined benefit pension, retiree or post-employment welfare or nonqualified deferred compensation (“Excluded Benefits”)) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Plans”) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement; (ii) provide other compensation and benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than the Excluded Benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Comparable Plans”); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation and benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than Excluded Benefits) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and target annual or shorter term cash incentive compensation opportunities will not be decreased during the Benefits Period for any Continuing Employee employed during that period. During the Benefits Period, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide to Continuing Employees severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement under the Company Benefit Plans listed on Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter that are designated as severance plans. 


(c)    New Plans. Except as otherwise required by applicable Laws at or after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent to, cause to be granted to the Continuing Employees credit for service with the   -84-

Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting in 401(k) or similar retirement benefits and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but not including for any purpose under a defined benefit pension plan or equity or equity-based compensation or benefit plan) to the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited to such Continuing Employee under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Date, except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws, Parent shall take commercially reasonable actions to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent waived under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan; (iii) any eligible expenses paid by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan to the same extent credited under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan for such purpose; and (iv) the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan to be credited with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee immediately following the Effective Time. 


(d)    No Third Person Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither this Section 6.11 nor any provisions of this Agreement relating to Company Benefit Plans will be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain or continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification, suspension or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit Plan.

No such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.13(a).

No such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to the Company pursuant to this Section 6.13(b).

(iii)    The representations and warranties set forth in the second sentence of Section 3.7(a) and the second sentence of Section 3.7(b) will be true and correct as of the Capitalization Date except where the failure to be so true and correct in all respects would not reasonably be expected to result in the requirement of Parent to pay pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(iii), Section 2.8(a) and Section 2.8(b) additional merger consideration in excess of $32,000,000 that would have been payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(iii), Section 2.8(a) and Section 2.8(b) had the representations and warranties set forth in the second sentence of Section 3.7(a) and the second sentence of Section 3.7(b) been true and correct in all respects as of the Capitalization Date.

7.4    Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of a condition set forth in this Article VII to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such Party’s failure to act in good faith or to use the requisite efforts to cause the Closing to occur as required by this Agreement. 


ARTICLE VIII TERMINATION 


8.1    Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval (except as provided in this Agreement), only as follows (it being understood and agreed that this Agreement may not be terminated for any other reason or on any other basis):

(c)    by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time has not occurred by 11:59 p.m. on January 21, 2022 (such time and date, the “Termination Date”), it being understood that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) will not be available to (i) Parent if the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i); (ii) the Company if Parent has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e); and (iii) any Party whose action or failure to act (which   -91-








________________


action or failure to act constitutes a breach by such Party of this Agreement) has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, either (A) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the terminating Party to consummate the Merger set forth in Article VII prior to the Termination Date; or (B) the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred prior to the Termination Date; 


(d)    by either Parent or the Company if the Company fails to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting at which a vote is taken on the adoption of this Agreement, except that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) will not be available to any Party whose action or failure to act (which action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by such Party of this Agreement) has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting; 


(e)    by Parent if the Company has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, except that if such breach or failure to perform is capable of being cured by the Termination Date, Parent will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) prior to the delivery by Parent to the Company of written notice of such breach or failure to perform, delivered at least 45 days prior to such termination, stating Parent’s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) and the basis for such termination, it being understood that Parent will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if (i) such breach or failure to perform has been cured prior to termination (to the extent capable of being cured); or (ii) the Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g);

(h)    by the Company (at any time prior to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval) if (i) the Company has received a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has authorized the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement to consummate the Acquisition Transaction contemplated by that Superior Proposal; (iii) concurrently with such termination, the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iii); and (iv) the Company has complied in all material respects with Section 5.3 with respect to such Superior Proposal; or 


(i)    by the Company if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or waived; (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to Section 2.3; (iii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that if Parent performs its obligations under this Agreement and the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter is funded, then the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate, and will consummate, the Merger; (iv) the Company gives Parent written notice at least two Business Days prior to such termination stating the Company’s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(i); and (v) the Merger has not have been consummated by the end of such two Business Day period, it being understood that the Company will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(i) if Parent has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e). 


8.2    Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. (a)    Manner of Termination. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such termination pursuant to such provision. 


(b)    Effect of Termination. Any proper and valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. Following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as applicable, except, and subject in all respects to this Section 8.2, that Section 8.3, Section 9.10 and Section 9.16, that Section 6.6(c), Section 6.6(f), Section 6.14, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 9.3, Section 9.4 and Article IX will each survive the termination of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, but subject to Section 8.3, Section 9.10 and Section 9.16, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability for any actual and intentional common law fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement (which liability the Parties acknowledge and agree (i) may not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs; and (ii) will be determined in the discretion of the Chosen Court). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any   -93-

termination of this Agreement, the Financing Sources will have no liability to the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect equityholders pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Debt Financing (including for any Willful Breach), except that the foregoing will not preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company and its Affiliates, in each case after the Closing Date, under any definitive agreements relating to any Debt Financing or any liability of the Financing Sources to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates under the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. No valid termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guaranty or the Financing Letters, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms. 


8.3    Fees and Expenses. (a)    General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.9(e), Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. 


(b)    Company Payments. (i)    Future Transactions. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c) at a time when the requisite stockholder approval has not been obtained, 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e); (B) at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) would be satisfied if the date of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (D) within one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated at any time, then the Company will, concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “15 percent” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50 percent.” 


(ii)    Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company must, within two Business Days   -94-








________________


following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time). 


(iii)    Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must, concurrently with such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b) (which Schedule may be updated by Parent from time to time). 


(c)    Parent Payment. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i), then Parent must, within two Business Days following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its designee an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(c) (which Schedule may be updated by the Company from time to time). 


(d)    Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company or Parent, as applicable, be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger. 


(e)    Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Merger and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(c) or any portion thereof, as applicable, then the non-paying party will pay or cause to be paid to the other party the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) of the other party in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made) plus five percent through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (collectively, “Enforcement Expenses”).   -95-

(f)    Sole and Exclusive Remedy. (i)    For the Company Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (including, without duplication, the Company’s right to enforce the Guaranty with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee from Guarantor), the Reimbursement Obligations, the Enforcement Expenses and the Company’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10 will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the Enforcement Expenses and the Reimbursement Obligations, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or for any matters forming the basis of such termination, except that the Parties or their respective Affiliates (or both) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(i) will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor from any liability for any (1) actual or intentional common law fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement (which liability the Parties acknowledge and agree (i) may not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs; and (ii) will be determined in the discretion of the Chosen Court); or (2) breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement, except, in each case, that under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Parent Related Parties (including for any Willful Breach (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for actual and intentional common law fraud)) under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement), the Guaranty or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount, in the aggregate, equal to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee plus the Enforcement Expenses plus the Reimbursement Obligations (such aggregate amount, the “Parent Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation (except for actual and intentional common law fraud) against the Parent Related Parties, and, other than with respect to actual and intentional common law fraud, in no event will the Company be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Guaranty, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Nothing in this Section 8.3(f)(i) will preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under the definitive agreements   -96-








________________


relating to the Debt Financing or limit the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. Other than Guarantor’s obligations under the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger. 


(ii)    For the Parent Related Parties. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b), the Enforcement Expenses and Parent’s right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10 will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and the Enforcement Expenses, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or for any matters forming the basis of such termination. Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b)) will be the only monetary damages that any Parent Related Party may recover from the Company Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, the termination of this Agreement, or the failure to consummate the Merger, and upon payment of such amount, (A) none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any Parent Related Party or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties or their respective Affiliates (or both) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable); and (B) no Parent Related Party or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding against any Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties or their respective Affiliates (or both) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(ii) will not relieve the Company from any liability for any (1) actual and intentional common law fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement (which liability the Parties acknowledge and agree (i) may not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs; and (ii) will be determined in the discretion of the Chosen Court) or (2) any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement, except, in each case, that under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches (including any Willful Breach (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for actual and intentional common law fraud)) under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed an amount, in the aggregate,   -97-








________________


equal to the amount of the Company Termination Fee plus the Reimbursement Obligations (such aggregate amount, the “Company Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Liability Limitation (except for actual and intentional common law fraud) against the Company Related Parties, and, other than with respect to actual and intentional common law fraud, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against the Company Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger, or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Other than the obligations of the Company provided in this Agreement, no Company Related Party or any Person other than the Company has any liability for monetary damages to any Parent Related Party or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger. 


(g)    Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Parties will each be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.10(b), except that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies under this Agreement, including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 9.10(b), under no circumstances will the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.10(b) and any monetary damages. 


ARTICLE IX GENERAL PROVISIONS 


9.1    Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b)    Specific Performance. (i)    Irreparable Damage. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement (including specific performance or other equitable relief to cause Parent to perform any obligations required of it to enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter); (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. 


(ii)    Specific Performance in Respect of the Financing.

________________


capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or waived; (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or is reasonably expected to be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur.

(iii)    No Objections; Cooperation.

Each Party agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in seeking and agreeing to an expedited schedule in any litigation seeking an injunction or order of specific performance to attempt to fully resolve any dispute between the Parties prior to the Termination Date.

(e)         For the avoidance of doubt, no interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of Eligible Shares on any amount payable upon the surrender of any Eligible Shares as contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1, and any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Paying Agent. Payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of an Eligible Share to which the holder of such Eligible Share is entitled pursuant to Sections 2.1(d) and 2.2(d), will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Eligible Share.   (f)         In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Eligible Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company and/or Hospitality, as applicable, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company and/or Hospitality, as applicable, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of any such Certificate or Certificates may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate or Certificates formerly representing such Eligible Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp or registration Taxes or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent.

(g)         From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or Hospitality, as applicable, of the Eligible Shares and the holders of any Certificates representing ownership of Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares except for the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, as applicable as provided for herein. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Share formerly representing any Eligible Shares is presented to the Company Surviving Corporation, the Hospitality Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Sections 2.1(d) and 2.2(d).

(h)         Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof (if any)) that remains undistributed or unclaimed by the holders of Eligible Shares on the date that is one year following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Eligible Shares who has not theretofore complied with the procedures, materials and instructions contemplated by this Section 3.1 shall thereafter look only to the Company Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof for payment of the Company Merger Consideration and/or Hospitality Merger Consideration to which such holder of Eligible Shares is entitled pursuant to Sections 2.1(d) and 2.2(d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporations, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Eligible Shares for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any Company Merger Consideration and/or Hospitality Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Company Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Company Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (i)          In the event any Certificate representing Eligible Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporations with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to termination of the Payment Fund pursuant to Section 3.1(h), the Company Surviving Corporation) will issue a check in the amount to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Sections 2.1(d) and 2.2(d).   (j)          Each of the Paired Entities, the Paying Agent, Parent, MergerCo 1, MergerCo 2 and the Surviving Corporations shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under all applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paired Entities, the Paying Agent, MergerCo 1, MergerCo 2, Parent or the Surviving Corporations and such amounts are paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   3.2        Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Company Merger Consideration and/or the Hospitality Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or other like exchange with respect to the Company Common Stock or Hospitality Class B Common Stock after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing set forth in this Section 3.2 shall be construed to supersede or in any way limit the prohibitions set forth in Section 6.1 hereof.   10

Hospitality shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any demands received by Hospitality for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to shares of Hospitality Class B Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and all other instruments served or actions taken pursuant to the DGCL and received by Hospitality with respect to the Appraisal Rights Provisions, and Parent shall have the right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, the performance in all material respects by the Paired Entities of their obligations under this Agreement and the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it or any Equity Investor would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of either Equity Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by Parent or the relevant Equity Investor, as applicable.

(b)         For all taxable years commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010, Hospitality (including its predecessor, ESH Hospitality, LLC) has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”) within the meaning of Sections 856-860 of the Code and has operated since December 31, 2010 (the year with respect to which Hospitality (or its predecessor) first made the election to be treated as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to the date hereof and intends to continue to operate until the Effective Time, in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT through such time. Hospitality has not taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in Hospitality’s failure to qualify as a REIT, and no challenge to Hospitality’s status or qualification as a REIT is pending or, to the knowledge of the Paired Entities, threatened in writing.

Each Subsidiary of Hospitality that is listed in Section 5.10(b) of the Paired Entities Disclosure Schedule as a partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company has, since the date of its formation and the date on which Hospitality acquired a direct or indirect interest in such entity, been treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation.

Each entity that is listed in Section 5.10(b) of the Paired Entities Disclosure Schedule as a REIT has been, since the date of its formation, treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Neither Hospitality nor any Subsidiary of Hospitality holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code (or otherwise result in any “built-in gains” Tax under Section 337(d) of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder).  Since November 12, 2013, the value (as determined under Section 269B of the Code) of all shares of Hospitality Class B Common Stock has represented less than 50% of the value of all of the outstanding shares of stock of Hospitality.   27

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board or the Hospitality Board may, prior to but not after the time the Requisite Vote is obtained, (A) make a Change of Recommendation if an Intervening Event has occurred and if, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, the Company Board or the Hospitality Board determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with such directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (B) if the Paired Entities have not breached this Section 7.5(c) and have not breached the other subsections of this Section 7.5 in any material respect, make a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) if the Paired Entities receive an Acquisition Proposal (not resulting from a breach of this Section 7.5) that the Company Board and the Hospitality Board have determined in good faith, after consulting with their financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (x) constitutes a Superior Proposal after having complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to, this Section 7.5(b) and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn and (y) the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with such directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that neither the Company Board nor the Hospitality Board may take any such action unless prior to making such Change of Recommendation or authorizing such termination to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i), (I) the Paired Entities provide prior written notice (“Notice Period Commencement Notice”) to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the “Notice Period”) of their intention to take such action, which notice shall include, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the name of the person or group making the Superior Proposal and substantial final draft of the definitive agreement reflecting such Superior Proposal and, in the case of an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event, (II) if requested by Parent, during the Notice Period the Paired Entities shall, and shall direct their Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith should Parent propose to make amendments or other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal and, in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure to take such action is no longer reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law as determined in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or the Hospitality Board after consulting with their financial advisor and outside legal counsel and (III) the Company Board and the Hospitality Board has taken into account any amendments or other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed to by Parent in writing prior to the end of the Notice Period and (1)  the Company Board and the Hospitality Board determined in good faith that, after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, in the case of an Intervening Event, a failure to make such Change of Recommendation continues to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (2) the Company Board and the Hospitality Board determined in good faith that, after consulting with their financial advisor and outside legal counsel, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to such Change of Recommendation continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and the failure to make such Change of Recommendation continues to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; it being understood that any change to the financial terms or any other material amendments or other material revisions to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal, including for purposes of the Notice Period; provided, however, that, subsequent to the initial Notice Period, the Notice Period shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice Period Commencement Notice.   55

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and Hospitality may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase “tail” policies covering the persons covered by their existing officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policies with respect to acts and omissions occurring prior to or as of the Effective Time, providing coverage for a period of six years following the Effective Time on terms no less favorable in the aggregate to such persons than provided by such insurance as of the date hereof; provided that (x) the purchase of any such tail policy shall be in lieu of Parent’s obligations under the foregoing provisions in this Section 7.6(c) and (y) the Company and Hospitality shall reasonably cooperate and consult with the Parent prior to the purchase of any such tail policy; provided, further, that if Parent can procure a “tail” policy on substantially comparable terms, but at a lower price, as compared to any such policy that may be procured by the Paired Entities, then Parent may obtain such policy effective as of the Effective Time, in which case the Paired Entities shall not obtain any such policy. If any tail policy has been purchased by the Company or Hospitality (or Parent pursuant to the second proviso in the preceding sentence) prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause such it to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Company Surviving Corporation and the Hospitality Surviving Corporation.   59

If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 7.6 that is denied by the Company Surviving Corporation or the Hospitality Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement, then Parent shall cause the Company Surviving Corporation and the Hospitality Surviving Corporation to pay such Indemnified Party’s reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against the Company Surviving Corporation and/or the Hospitality Surviving Corporation.   ( g )         The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.6 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of Paired Entities or any of the Paired Entities Subsidiaries or the Company Surviving Corporation or the Hospitality Surviving Corporation, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws and Parent shall cause the Company Surviving Corporation and the Hospitality Surviving Corporation to honor and perform under all indemnification agreements with any Indemnified Party entered into by any Paired Entity or any Paired Entities Subsidiary prior to the date of this Agreement.   60

(d)         All payments under this Section 9.2 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the intended recipient. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement absent such agreement and that each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the receiving party in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation or consummation of the Mergers, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate the precision. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall the Paired Entities be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (ii) in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In the event that either the Paired Entities shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, the Paired Entities shall reimburse Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by them (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.2 in the event that Parent prevails in such litigation, and in the event that either Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, Parent, MergerCo 1 and MergerCo 2 shall reimburse the Paired Entities for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by them (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.2 in the event that the Paired Entities prevail in such litigation.   78

All references in this Agreement to Articles, Sections and Exhibits shall refer to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits to, this Agreement unless the context shall require otherwise. The words “include,” “includes” and “including” shall not be limiting and shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation.” The word “day” means calendar day, and any reference to a number of days shall refer to calendar days (unless Business Days are specified). When calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step is to be taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any reference in this Agreement to “$” means U.S. dollars. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”.

References to the “ordinary course” or the “ordinary course of business” for any person shall refer to an action taken by a person that is consistent in all material respects in nature, scope, and magnitude with the past practices of such person and is taken in the ordinary course of the normal operations of such person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any COVID-19 Response by the Paired Entities prior to the date of this Agreement).  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in this Agreement to any statute include the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case as amended, re-enacted, consolidated or replaced from time to time and in the case of any such amendment, re-enactment, consolidation or replacement, reference herein to a particular provision shall be read as referring to such amended, re-enacted, consolidated or replaced provision and also include, unless the context otherwise requires, all applicable guidelines, bulletins or policies made in connection therewith.

Except for any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time (which shall survive the Effective Time), none of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, shall survive the Effective Time, and thereafter there shall be no Liability on the part of either Parent, MergerCo 1, MergerCo 2, the Company or Hospitality or any of their respective officers, directors or stockholders in respect thereof. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.4 without notice or liability to any other person.

( a )         The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed by a Paired Entity in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, prior to termination of this Agreement, (i) Parent, MergerCo 1 and/or MergerCo 2 shall be entitled to injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by a Paired Entity and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 are entitled at Law or in equity, (ii) the Paired Entities waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or other security in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the Paired Entities shall not allege, and each of the Paired Entities hereby waive, that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that a remedy of specific performance or an injunction is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason.  The parties hereto explicitly agree that the Paired Entities shall not be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 (or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof); provided, however, that the Paired Entities shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent of Section 7.7(b).  In no event shall the Paired Entities have the right to seek or obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party or another person or otherwise) from Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 other than, and the Paired Entities’ sole and exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 or otherwise shall be, the right of the Paired Entities to seek payment of the Parent Termination Fee solely to the extent payable pursuant to Section 9.2(c), and the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent contained in Section 7.11(d), the last sentence of Section 7.17 and the last sentence of Section 9.2(d).   94
















________________




(b)         The parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to Section 10.7(a) shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any of Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2  seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under Section 9.2, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in Section 10.7(a) are not available or otherwise not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 to institute any Legal Action for (or limit any of Parent’s, MergerCo 1’s or MergerCo 2’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 10.7 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article IX (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Action by any of Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 seeking remedies pursuant to Section 10.7(a) or anything set forth in this Section 10.7 restrict or limit Parent’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article IX or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.   ( c )         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, MergerCo 1 and MergerCo 2 together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company, Hospitality or their affiliates relating to the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, or a breach of this Agreement by Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the Parent Termination Fee, amounts payable by the Parent pursuant to Section 7.11(d), the last sentence of Section 7.17 and the last sentence of Section 9.2 (the “Liability Limitation”), and in no event shall the Company, Hospitality or any of their affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise.  Each of the Company and Hospitality agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Parties (other than Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 to the extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. and Starwood Capital Group Global, LLC to the extent provided in their respective Confidentiality Agreement), through Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 against any Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Guarantors (but not any other Parent Party) under and to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein.  Recourse against the Guarantors under the Limited Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, Hospitality and their affiliates against the Guarantors and any other Parent Party (other than Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 to the extent provided in this Agreement and  Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. and Starwood Capital Group Global, LLC to the extent provided in their respective Confidentiality Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.  Without limiting the rights of the Company or Hospitality against Parent, MergerCo 1 or MergerCo 2 hereunder and  Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. or Starwood Capital Group Global, LLC under their respective Confidentiality Agreement, in no event shall the Company, Hospitality or their affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from, any Parent Party (other than the Guarantors to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein).   95

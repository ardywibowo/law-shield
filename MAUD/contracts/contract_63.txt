  (e)           Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent and/or the Paying Agent pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement or otherwise, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent and/or the Paying Agent pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement or otherwise as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such Certificate, issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.02(g)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Eligible Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or deposit with respect to any demands for appraisals, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise waived or lost the right under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall become Eligible Shares and thereupon converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such Eligible Shares pursuant to this Article III.   (g)           Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent (and any of their respective Affiliates) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(c)           Notice of Acquisition Proposals. The Company shall promptly (but, in any event, within 24 hours) give notice to Parent if any Acquisition Proposal is received by the Company or any of its directors or officers from any Person or Persons, setting forth in such notice the name of such Person or Persons and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including, if applicable, correct and complete copies of any written Acquisition Proposals, including proposed agreements (or where no such copies are available, a reasonably detailed written description thereof)), and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis of the status of the foregoing.   (d)           No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement.   (i)               Except as permitted by Section 6.02(d)(iii) and taking into account Section 6.02(e), the Company Board shall not (any of the actions described in any of clauses (A) through (F) below, a “Change of Recommendation”):   (A)             fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9;   (B)             withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent;   (C)             with respect to an Acquisition Proposal initiated through a tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, fail to recommend unequivocally against acceptance of such offer within 10 Business Days of commencement of such offer;

(ii)                 Except as permitted by Section 6.02(d)(iii), the Company Board shall not cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or agree, authorize or commit to do so.   (iii)                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may:   (x) effect a Change of Recommendation if: (A)  a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a violation of this Section 6.02 is received by the Company and has not been withdrawn, and  the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, after consultation with its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (B) the Company Board determines in good faith that an Intervening Event has occurred and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with

  provided, however, that no such actions described in either of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) may be taken unless and until: (1) the Company has given Parent written notice at least four Business Days in advance (the “Notice Period”), which notice shall set forth in writing that the Company Board intends to consider whether to take such action, and a reasonably detailed description of the Superior Proposal or other cause for the Change of Recommendation, as applicable (including, with respect to a Superior Proposal, the name of such Person or Persons making such Superior Proposal and correct and complete copies of the definitive agreement for the Superior Proposal and the material ancillary agreements contemplated thereby); (2) during the Notice Period, to the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent, to the extent that Parent has notified the Company during the Notice Period that it wishes to do so and has made its Representatives available during such Notice Period for such purposes, to allow Parent to make during such Notice Period proposals to revise the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case of a Change of Recommendation contemplated in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal would no longer be a Superior Proposal, or, in the case of a Change of Recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event, failure to effect such Change of Recommendation would not be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (3) at or after the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board shall have taken into account any revisions to this Agreement offered by Parent in writing in response to such notice contemplated by clause (1) of this Section 6.02(d)(iii) prior to the end of the Notice Period, and shall have thereafter determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would continue to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, if applicable, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood that any revisions to any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Section 6.02(c) and this Section 6.02(d)(iii), including for purposes of the Notice Period, except that subsequent to the initial Notice Period, the Notice Period shall be reduced to three Business Days).   (e)           Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing set forth in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i) disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3), or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any “stop, look and listen” communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act and any such disclosures or communications shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation.   (f)            Existing Discussions. The Company (i) acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date of this Agreement, it has ceased and caused to be terminated any activities, solicitations, discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours of the execution and delivery of this Agreement): (A) deliver a written notice to each such Person providing only that the Company (1) is ending all activities, discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and (2) is requesting the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information concerning the Company and any of its Subsidiaries; and (B) if applicable, terminate any physical and electronic data or other diligence access previously granted to such Persons.   (g)           Standstill Provisions. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall not terminate, amend or otherwise modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, “standstill” or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement; provided that the Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend or otherwise modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any such agreement if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(ii)              In connection therewith, and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent shall have the right to direct and control all matters with any Governmental Entity; provided that the Company shall have the right to participate in all such matters and to review in advance and, to the extent reasonably practicable, Parent will consult with the Company on and consider in good faith the views of the Company in connection with, all of the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer or the Merger. Neither Parent nor the Company shall permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and consistent with usual practice, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. In exercising the rights contemplated by this Section 6.04(a)(ii), each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable.

(c)           Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing at least 10 Business Days prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause the Company 401(k) Plans to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 (a)           Subject to the provisions of applicable Law and the provisions of Section 6.09, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, this Agreement may be amended or otherwise modified only by a written instrument duly executed and delivered by the Parties (and in the case of the Company and Merger Sub, by action taken or authorized by the Company Board or board of directors of Merger Sub, respectively).   (b)           The conditions to each of the respective Parties’ obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are for the sole benefit of such Party and at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, may be waived by such Party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law; provided, however, that any such waiver shall only be effective if made in a written instrument duly executed and delivered by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under applicable Law shall operate as a waiver of such rights and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law except to the extent provided for otherwise in Section 8.05.   Section 9.06.      Governing Law and Venue; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury.   (a)           This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the Laws of the state of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions, rules or principles thereof (or any other jurisdiction) to the extent that such provisions, rules or principles would direct a matter to another jurisdiction.   


-81-   


  (b)           Each of the Parties agrees that: (i) it shall bring any Proceeding against any other Party in connection with, arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement, any instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in the Chosen Courts; and (ii) solely in connection with such Proceedings, (A) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (B) irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue in any such Proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (C) irrevocably waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any Party, (D) agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such Proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.02 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof and (E) it shall not assert as a defense any matter or claim waived by the foregoing clauses (A) through (D) of this Section 9.06(b) or that any Order issued by the Chosen Courts may not be enforced in or by the Chosen Courts.   (c)           Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any Proceeding against any other Party which may be connected with, arise out of or otherwise relate to this Agreement, any instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is expected to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any such Proceeding. Each Party hereby acknowledges and certifies that (i) no Representative of the other Parties has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Parties would not, in the event of any Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) it understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) it makes this waiver voluntarily and (iv) it has been induced to enter into this Agreement, the instruments or other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers, acknowledgments and certifications set forth in this Section 9.06(c).   Section 9.07.      Specific Performance.   (a)           Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, except to the extent provided otherwise in Section 8.05, in addition to any other available remedies a Party may have in equity or at law, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, consistent with the provisions of Section 9.06(b), in the Chosen Courts without necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a final and non-appealable judgment in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. In the event that any Proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law, except to the extent consistent with the provisions set forth in Section 8.05.

  (b)           To the extent any Party brings a Proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than a Proceeding to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the End Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth Business Day following the resolution of such Proceeding, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such Proceeding.   Section 9.08.      Third-Party Beneficiaries. The Parties hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies, express or implied, hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, except (i) from and after the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.09 and each of their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns shall be third-party beneficiaries, (ii) if the Offer Acceptance Time occurs, for the rights of holders of Shares that validly tendered (and did not withdraw) their Shares in the Offer to receive the Offer Price in respect of such Shares, and (iii) if the Effective Time occurs, for the rights of the holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration and for the rights of the holders of Company Equity Awards to receive such amounts as provided for in Section 3.03.   Section 9.09.      Fulfillment of Obligations. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Any obligation of one Party to any other Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed or satisfied by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been performed or satisfied by such Party.

successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. No Party may assign any of its rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of Law, by transfer or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other Parties not seeking to assign any of its rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations, except as provided for in Section 9.09, and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 9.10 shall be null and void; provided, however, that Parent may designate another Wholly Owned Subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references to Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed references to such other Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent, except that all representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other Wholly Owned Subsidiary as of the date of such designation.

  Section 9.11.      Entire Agreement.   (a)           This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules), the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior and contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, understandings, representations and warranties, whether oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect until the Closing.   (b)           In the event of (a) any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement, on the one hand, and any of the Exhibits and Schedules or the Company Disclosure Schedule (other than an exception expressly set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule), on the other hand, the statements in the body of this Agreement shall control or (b) any inconsistency between the statements in this Agreement, on the one hand, and the Confidentiality Agreement, on the other hand, the statements in this Agreement shall control.   Section 9.12.      Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision to be negotiated by the Parties, each acting reasonably and in good faith shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be legal, valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability affect the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.   Section 9.13.      Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement (a) may be executed in any number of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement and (b) shall become effective when each Party shall have received one or more counterparts hereof signed by each of the other Parties. An executed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, email or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original executed copy of this Agreement.

 Annex I   Conditions to the Offer   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Merger Sub’s right to extend and amend the Offer pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, pay for any Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer if any of the following conditions exist, or have occurred and are continuing, at the scheduled Expiration Time of the Offer:   (a)           Minimum Condition. The number of Shares validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the Offer (but excluding shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been received), together with the Shares then owned by Merger Sub, does not represent at least one share more than 50% of the then outstanding Shares (the “Minimum Condition”).   (b)           Legal Prohibition. Any Restraint shall be in effect and makes unlawful or prevents the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.   (c)           Antitrust Approvals. The statutory waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, if applicable, any contractual waiting periods under any timing agreements under the HSR Act with a Governmental Antitrust Entity applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall not have expired or been earlier terminated.

Parent and/or Merger Sub shall not have received all consents and/or clearances required from the OIO and/or the NZMOF to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the NZ Act.   (f)            Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the Company (i) set forth in Section 4.02(a) (Capital Structure) shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except for de minimis inaccuracies; (ii) set forth in Section 4.01(a) (Organization, Good Standing and Qualification), Section 4.02 (Capital Structure) (other than clause (a)), Section 4.03 (Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness), Section 4.04(b)(i)(x) (No Violations) and Section 4.22 (Brokers and Finders) shall not be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to “materiality”, “Material Adverse Effect” and words of similar import set forth therein) in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date); and (iii) set forth in the Agreement, other than those Sections specifically identified in clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (f), shall not be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to “materiality”, “Material Adverse Effect” and words of similar import set forth therein) as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except, in the case of this clause (iii), where the failure to be true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   


    


  (g)           Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company shall not have complied with or performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement prior to the Expiration Time, and such failure to comply shall not have been cured by the Expiration Time.   (h)           No Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any event, change, development, circumstance, fact or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect.   (i)            Company Certificate. Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company certifying as to the satisfaction of the conditions described in paragraphs (f) and (g) above.   (j)            No Termination of Agreement. This Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.   (k)           Non-Competition Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and, other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.   The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth in this Agreement to which it is annexed.

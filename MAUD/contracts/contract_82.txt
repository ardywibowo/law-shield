AGREEMENT 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I THE MERGER 


Section 1.1    The Merger. (a)    Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of such conditions at the Closing), at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”) as a wholly owned indirect Subsidiary of Parent.








________________


(b)    The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the “Closing”) to be held remotely via electronic transmission of related documentation or similar means, on a date and at a time to be agreed upon by Parent and the Company, which date shall be no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of such conditions at the Closing), or at such other location, date and time as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree upon in writing. The date upon which the Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the “Closing Date.” 


(c)    At the Closing, the Company shall file a certificate of merger in requisite and customary form and substance with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be mutually agreed to by the parties and as specified in the certificate of merger) (the time as of which the Merger becomes effective, the “Effective Time”). 


(d)    From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the DGCL. 


Section 1.2    Conversion of Shares of Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary or Parent: 


(a)    except as otherwise provided in Section 1.2(b), Section 1.2(c) or Section 1.4, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive $37.00 in cash, without interest (such amount, as may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.8, the “Merger Consideration”), and each holder of any such share of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.3 or Section 1.5, as applicable; 


(b)    each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; 


(c)    each share of Company Common Stock held by a wholly owned Company Subsidiary, if any, and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly or indirectly by Parent, if any, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares (or fractional shares) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such holder shall own the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such holder owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted; 


(d)    each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute, together with any shares issued in accordance with Section 1.2(c), the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   2

Section 1.3    Surrender and Payment. (a)    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.2(a). Parent shall provide (or shall cause to be provided) to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of (i) the certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”) and (ii) the uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”) (but not any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company RSU Merger Consideration or the Company RSA Merger Consideration) (such cash, the “Exchange Fund”). If, for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (excluding any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company RSU Merger Consideration or the Company RSA Merger Consideration), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to pay all such amounts, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof. All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall only be used for the purposes provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent before the Effective Time. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent) a letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 


(b)    Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Company Restricted Shares) that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. 


(c)    If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay in advance to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   3








________________


(d)    After the Effective Time, the transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article I. 


(e)    Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(f)    The agreement with the Exchange Agent shall provide that the Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment (including any losses thereon) shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Article I, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) all such investments shall be in (w) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (x) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (y) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services or (z) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent. 


(g)    Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 


Section 1.4    Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with Section 1.2(b) or converted in accordance with Section 1.2(c)) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.2(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be, in compliance with Section 1.3. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company   4

Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under the DGCL consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent. 


Section 1.5    Company Equity Awards. (a)    Neither Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume any Company Options or substitute for any Company Option any option for Surviving Corporation or Parent stock, in connection with the Merger or any of the Transactions. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Options, (i) all Unvested Company Options which are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become exercisable, and become Vested Company Options, and (ii) to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time, with the former holder of such canceled Company Option becoming entitled to receive in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in Section 1.6) equal to: (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option; multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option (the “Company Option Merger Consideration”); provided, however, that, if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled and terminated without any consideration in respect thereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Option Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in Section 1.6, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time). 


(b)    Neither Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume any Company RSU or substitute for any Company RSU any similar award for Surviving Corporation or Parent stock in connection with the Merger or any of the Transactions. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of Company RSUs, (i) all Unvested Company RSUs which are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become Vested Company RSUs, and (ii) each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective Time, with the former holder of such canceled Company RSU becoming entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company RSU, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in Section 1.6) equal to (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (the “Company RSU Merger Consideration”). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company RSU Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in Section 1.6, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time); provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU which immediately prior to such cancellation was “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Company RSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.   5








________________


(c)    Neither Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume any Company Restricted Shares or substitute for any Company Restricted Shares any similar award for Surviving Corporation or Parent stock, in connection with the Merger or any of the Transactions. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Restricted Shares, (i) all unvested Company Restricted Shares which are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become unrestricted Company Common Stock, and (ii) each such share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the same manner as any other share of Company Common Stock (the “Company RSA Merger Consideration”); provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company RSA Merger Consideration, without interest thereon and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in Section 1.6, shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time). 


(d)    The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) and the Company, as applicable, shall take such actions as are necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.5, including making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof or any administrator of a Stock Plan as may be necessary in connection therewith. 


(e)    Promptly following the Agreement Date, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions to provide that, (i) with respect to any outstanding Option Period(s) (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) under the Company ESPP as of the Agreement Date, no participant in the Company ESPP may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election in effect on the Agreement Date for such Option Period and no new participants may participate in such Option Period; (ii) no new Option Period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP on or after the Agreement Date; (iii) any Option Period under the Company ESPP that does not end prior to the Effective Time shall terminate and an Exercise Date (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) shall occur under the Company ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Option Period, in which case any shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to such Option Period shall be treated the same as all other shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.2(a); and (iv) immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall terminate. 


Section 1.6    Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, so withholds amounts and properly pays such amounts over to a Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Restricted Shares, as applicable, in respect of which the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 


Section 1.7    Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the   6

Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article I. 


Section 1.8    Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger, issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and shall, as so adjusted from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 1.8 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to the Company Common Stock that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement, including Section 5.2. 


ARTICLE II THE SURVIVING CORPORATION 


Section 2.1    Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (except that all references to the name of Merger Subsidiary therein shall be modified to refer to the name of the Company), as set forth on Exhibit B, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation. 


Section 2.2    Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that all references to the name of Merger Subsidiary therein shall be modified to refer to the name of the Company), as set forth on Exhibit C, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such bylaws. 


Section 2.3    Directors and Officers. (a)    The directors of the Surviving Corporation shall from and after the Effective Time until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation be the respective individuals who are directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


(b)    The officers of the Surviving Corporation shall from and after the Effective Time until their successors have been duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation be the respective individuals who are officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 


Except as (i) disclosed in the Company SEC Reports that are publicly available on the internet website of the SEC at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Agreement Date (excluding in each case any disclosures contained therein (other than those disclosures which relate to specific historical events or circumstances affecting the Company) under the captions “Risk Factors,” “Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement,” “Quantitative or Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and any other disclosures contained therein to the extent they are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) (it being agreed   7

that any matter disclosed in the Company SEC Reports shall not qualify the Capitalization Representations) or (ii) set forth in the disclosure letter (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein, provided that any disclosure set forth with respect to any particular Section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to any other applicable Section if the disclosure in respect of the particular Section is sufficient on its face to inform Parent of the applicability of such disclosure to such other Section) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Letter”), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Merger Subsidiary and Parent as follows:

(b)    Indemnification. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 5.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including, to the extent applicable, a duty to advance reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or other Affiliates that occurred prior to or at the Effective Time or (ii) any of the Transactions; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification or advancement under this Section 5.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all and/or advance reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person promptly after statements therefor are received.

The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder. 


(d)    Successors and Assigns. If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) set forth in this Section 5.10. 


(e)    No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries.

affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 5.10 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity). 


(f)    Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations and liability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries under this Section 5.10 shall be joint and several.

Section 5.11    Transaction Litigation. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of all Legal Proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers, in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any of the other Transactions (“Transaction Litigation”) (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall (a) give Parent reasonable opportunity (at Parent’s sole expense and subject to a customary joint defense agreement) to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. Further, the Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or propose or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent’s right to “participate” in the defense and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation shall not afford Parent any decision-making power over such Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above. 


Section 5.12    Rule 16b-3. Merger Subsidiary, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause the Transactions, and any other dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the Company or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

________________


(b)    During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to, provide to each Covered Employee for so long as such Covered Employee remains employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary during the Continuation Period, (i) compensation (such term to include salary, annual cash bonus opportunities, commissions and severance) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses, and nonqualified deferred compensation) provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) benefits (including the costs thereof to Company Employee Benefit Plan participants) that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the benefits (excluding, any defined benefit pension plan, retiree medical benefits, equity or equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses, and nonqualified deferred compensation) provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


(c)    In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (“Parent Employee Benefit Plan”) following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to, for Covered Employees who become eligible during the calendar year including the Effective Time: (i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered Employee under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision benefits to the same extent such limitation was waived or satisfied under the Company Employee Benefit Plan the Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employee’s coverage under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the Company Employee Benefit Plan in which the Covered Employee participated immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan. 


(d)    As of the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, all service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company (or any predecessor entities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits, as applicable) to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this Section 5.13(d) result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

Section 5.14    Confidentiality. The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a nondisclosure agreement, dated as of February 16, 2021 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”), which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein, it being understood that the term “Recipient Representatives” thereunder shall be deemed to include the Financing Parties. 


Section 5.15    Financing. (a)    Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary to consummate the funding of the Financing or any Substitute Financing in an amount sufficient, together with cash on hand and/or the proceeds of any offering (any such offering, “Permanent Financing”) that in each case replaces or supplements the Financing consistent with the terms set forth in this Section 5.15, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article I and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby) no later than the Closing, including, to the extent necessary to consummate the Merger and such other transactions, using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Documents and in all material respects comply with all of their respective obligations thereunder and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all the conditions to the funding of the Financing that are in Parent’s (or its Subsidiaries’) control. In the event that all conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding of the Financing, shall have been satisfied or waived, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons providing the Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article I and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby). Parent and/or Borrower shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and payable, all fees and other amounts under the Financing Documents. 


(b)    Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the status of the Financing and the satisfaction of the conditions thereof, including providing copies of any amendment, modification, supplement or replacement of the Financing Documents (provided, that any syndication letter or fee letter may be redacted to remove the fee amounts, the rates and amounts included in the “market flex” and other economic terms that could not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Financing) and shall give the Company prompt notice of any fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on the availability of the Financing necessary for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and its Subsidiaries’ obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article I and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, promptly after obtaining Knowledge thereof, providing the Company written notice of any (A) material breach or default by a Financing Party or any other party of any Financing Document or any other definitive document related to the Financing, (B) actual or threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination in writing of any of the Financing Documents by the Financing Parties or (C) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Documents or any other definitive document related to the Financing, on the one hand, and Parent or Borrower, on the other hand, in each case with respect to the obligations to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing   42

to be funded at Closing; provided, that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the extent such privilege is asserted in good faith or otherwise would violate or contravene any Law or any obligation of confidentiality. Parent and Borrower may amend, modify, replace, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Financing Documents without the prior written approval of the Company, provided, that Parent and Borrower shall not, without the Company’s prior written consent, permit any such amendment, replacement, modification, assignment, termination or waiver to be made to, or consent to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the Financing Documents which would (i) reduce the aggregate cash amounts of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or the original issue discount) unless the aggregate amount of the Financing following such reduction, together with cash on hand, the net proceeds of any Permanent Financing and other financial resources of Parent on the Closing Date, is sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article I and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that any such reduction in such amounts in accordance with the terms of the Financing Documents or as a result of the consummation of any Permanent Financing shall be permitted), (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the funding of the Financing or (iii) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Financing Documents, in a manner that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the funding of the Financing) on the Closing Date or (B) materially adversely affect the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Borrower may modify, supplement or amend the Financing Documents to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Financing Documents as of the date of this Agreement; provided, further, that any such additional lenders which assume commitments in respect of the Financing Documents shall be bona fide lenders of substantially the same, or better, credit quality (as determined by Parent in good faith) as the Financing Parties on the date hereof. In the event that new credit agreements, syndication letters and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Financing Documents permitted pursuant to this Section 5.15, such new credit agreements, syndication letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be “Financing Documents” for all purposes of this Agreement and references to “Financing” herein shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the Financing Documents as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, as applicable. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Financing Documents. If funds with respect to all or any portion of the Financing become unavailable (other than in accordance with the terms of the Financing Documents or as a result of the receipt of net proceeds of any Permanent Financing), Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (x) notify the Company in writing thereof and (y) use reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing, including, as applicable, a commitment to provide such substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable to Parent and/or Borrower, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable Financing Documents) sufficient, together with cash on hand, the net proceeds of any Permanent Financing and other financial resources of Parent on the Closing Date, to enable Parent and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article I and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby) in accordance with the terms hereof (the “Substitute Financing”) and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the Company correct and complete copies of the new financing documents, including any new credit agreement or commitment letter and any related syndication letters and/or fee letters (in redacted form removing the fee amounts, the rates and amounts included in the “market flex” and other economic terms that could not   43

(g)    by Parent in the event (i) of a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement or (ii) that any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have become inaccurate, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b), as applicable, would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become inaccurate, as applicable; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach by the Company or such inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company are curable by the Company prior to the Termination Date through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) until the earlier to occur of (A) thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach or inaccuracy, as applicable or (B) the Company ceasing to exercise and continuing not to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being understood that Parent and Merger Subsidiary may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) if such breach or inaccuracy by the Company is cured within such thirty (30) calendar day period); or 


(h)    by Parent in the event that a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred; or 


(i)    by Parent, if any Legal Restraint that imposes, or would upon the consummation of the Merger impose, a Burdensome Condition shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable. 


Section 7.2    Notice of Termination. A party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 (other than Section 7.1(a)) shall deliver a written notice to the other party setting forth specific basis for such termination and the specific provision of Section 7.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated. A valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 (other than Section 7.1(a)) shall be effective upon receipt by the non-terminating party of the foregoing written notice, validly given. 


Section 7.3    Effect of Termination. In the event of a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any stockholder, director, manager, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party or parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of Section 5.8, Section 5.14, this Section 7.3, Section 7.4 and Article VIII, each of which shall   50








________________


survive the termination of this Agreement, (b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for any Fraud committed in connection with this Agreement or any of Transactions and (c) that nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for Willful Breach in connection with this Agreement or any of the Transactions. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms and remain fully enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. For purposes of this Agreement, “Willful Breach” means a breach that is a consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching party with the Knowledge that the taking of or the omission of taking such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of this Agreement; provided that, without limiting the meaning of Willful Breach, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any failure by any party to consummate the Merger and the Transactions after the applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the Merger), including as a result of a failure to have necessary financing to cause the Closing to occur, shall constitute a Willful Breach of this Agreement. 


Section 7.4    Company Termination Fees. (a)    In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c), (B) following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the termination thereof, an offer or proposal for a Competing Acquisition Transaction is publicly announced or shall become publicly known and is not publicly withdrawn without qualification at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting and (C) within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement, a Competing Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Competing Acquisition Transaction, then within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of the entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement and the consummation of a Competing Acquisition Transaction, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee. “Company Termination Fee” means an amount equal to $59,220,000. 


(b)    In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then as a condition to such termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. 


(c)    In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. 


(d)    The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events. 


(e)    Recovery. Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that the covenants set forth in this Section 7.4 are an integral part of this Agreement and the Merger, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 7.4 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 7.4 or any portion thereof, the Company   51








________________


will pay to Parent its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and costs) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law. 


(f)    Acknowledgement. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.4 are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions and shall be (together with all interest as described in Section 7.4(e)) the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement where the Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4 and the Company Termination Fee is actually paid to Parent. 


ARTICLE VIII MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 


Section 8.1    Amendment or Supplement. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time only by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company; provided, however, that after the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the further approval of such stockholders of the Company without such further approval. 


Section 8.2    Extension of Time, Waiver, etc. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law: (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto; provided, however, that after adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock (if applicable), no waiver shall be made which would pursuant to applicable Law require further approval by such holders without obtaining such further approval; (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Merger Subsidiary or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. 


Section 8.3    No Survival. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing. This Section 8.3 shall not limit the survival of any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance in whole or in part after the Closing. 


Section 8.4    Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Letter and the documents and instruments relating to the Merger referred to in this Agreement, constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, provided, however, the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES   52

This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create any agreement of employment with any person, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except (a) with respect to the Indemnified Persons who are express third party beneficiaries of Section 5.10 and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the right of the holders of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration payable in accordance with Section 1.3. 


Section 8.5    Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. (a)    THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such Court of Chancery shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal courts of the United States of America located in the County of New Castle, Delaware, solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of (and any claim or cause of action arising under or relating to) this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, suit or proceedings shall be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.8 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. 


(b)    EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HEREBY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY   53

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 7.4, (A) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 7.4 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate Parent and Merger Subsidiary for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. 


(d)    The parties hereto hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any party hereto, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any party under this Agreement. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 8.5, a party hereto shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 8.5 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 8.5 shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.5 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this Section 8.5 or anything set forth in this Section 8.5 restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. 


(e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) business day following the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

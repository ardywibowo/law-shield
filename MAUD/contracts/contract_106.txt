(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, as provided in Section 3.03(f)) and instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent (such materials and instructions to include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an “agent’s message” with respect to Book-Entry Shares and to be in such form and have such provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree). Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable) representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III and (y) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.03(g)) equal to (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (B) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Exchange Agent is presented with the Certificate formerly representing such Shares and/or all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, and if a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable, representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.   -15-

(d) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 3.03(d) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of the share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a). (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be administered by the Exchange Agent until such time as any unclaimed portion thereof is delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered. (g) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. (h) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares or the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement.   -16-

(c) Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit (a “Company RSU”) under the Company Stock Plans, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full, shall be cancelled, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company RSUs to receive, on the first regular payroll date of the Company following the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of such Company RSUs and (ii) the Equity Award Cashout Price (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting, which Tax withholding may, at the election of the holder, be effected by deduction from such cash amount equal to the amount of Taxes to be withheld).   -17-

In the event any of the restrictions in this Section 5.07(e) shall apply, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Law. 5.08 Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees and Affiliates shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ agents and representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees and Affiliates shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its agents and representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; (B) at any time prior, but not after, the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive in the aggregate to the other party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; or (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be   -54-

terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.08. The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly, but in no event later than the next succeeding Business Day, if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. 5.09 Certain Policies . Immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided that Parent has confirmed in writing that all conditions to its obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is prepared to effect the Merger, the Company and PM Bank shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the rules and regulations of the CDFPI, the Federal Reserve and applicable banking Law, modify or change its loan, other real estate owned, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of BoC Bank; provided, however, that unless the modification or changes would otherwise be necessary to be consistent with applicable Law or with regulatory accounting principles and GAAP, no such modification or change shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred, or as an admission or acknowledgement by the Company that any such modification or change is appropriate or required or that any financial statement or information previously provided by the Company was incorrect in any respect. 5.10 Regulatory Applications . (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or in the case of Parent cause to be filed, all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third parties and/or Governmental Authorities in order to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby; and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities shall be made by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof and in any event within forty-five (45) calendar days of the date hereof. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall consult with the other on, all written information submitted to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such Parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other Party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and/or Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the   -55-

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party shall keep the other Party apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby (including promptly furnishing the other with copies of the non-confidential portions of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, from any third party and/or Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, to the extent permitted by Law, providing descriptions of any oral communications from such Persons). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Authorities that would reasonably be likely, in each case following the Effective Time (but regardless when the action, condition or restriction is to be taken or implemented), to (i) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to the Company) or a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) require Parent, BoC Bank or the Surviving Corporation or the surviving bank in the Bank Merger to raise additional capital in an amount that would materially reduce the economic benefits of the Merger to Parent or the holders of Parent Common Stock (including the Company shareholders in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock received by them in the Merger) (a “Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition”). (b) Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other Party to any third party and/or Governmental Authority. 5.11 Indemnification; Director’s and Officer’s Insurance. (a) Parent agrees that from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company (each, an “Indemnified Party” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a “Claim”), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, however, the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). Further, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, perform and observe the obligations of the Company under any agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement to indemnify those Persons who are or have at any time been directors and officers of the Company for their acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in their capacity as officers or directors.   -56-








________________


(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent or the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. (c) Parent shall or, with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may, purchase, at or prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding 250% of the current annual premium for such insurance. If such prepaid “tail” policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section 5.11. (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11. 5.12 Benefit Plans. (a) From the Effective Time through the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (such employees “Continuing Employees”) with a base salary or base wage, cash incentive opportunities and pension and welfare opportunities (excluding equity and long term incentive compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and severance benefits that are the greater of the severance benefits as set forth in Schedule 5.12(a) and any severance benefits that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.   -57-

(b) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its employee benefit and compensation plans to take into account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual thereunder, the service of the Continuing Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any predecessor entities) as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service and other than for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries and for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits). (c) From and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of Section 5.12(a), with respect to each Continuing Employee (and their beneficiaries) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each life, disability, medical, dental or health plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which each such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the applicable life, disability, medical, dental or health plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide full credit under medical, dental and health plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees (and their beneficiaries) under analogous plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation, actively-at-work requirement or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing Employees and their beneficiaries on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or beneficiary had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time. (d) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing no later than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause the Company’s 401(k) plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”) to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time; provided, however, that the effectiveness of such termination may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. As soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time and consistent with the Company 401(k) Plan’s normal distribution procedures, all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive, at their election, a distribution of their entire account balance from the Company 401(k) Plan. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that a defined contribution qualified retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement established and maintained by Parent or its Affiliates shall accept rollovers of such distributions and participant loans by the Continuing Employees that   -58-








________________


elect such rollovers from the Company 401(k) Plan. The Parties agree to cooperate as reasonably necessary so as not to place any participant 401(k) loan with respect to a Continuing Employee’s rollover account into default during the period from the Effective Time until the rollover is completed; provided, that such employee continues making loan repayments on a timely basis during such period as may be required to prevent a loan default. (e) To the extent any Benefit Plan limits the amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) in order to preclude such amount from being considered an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, the Company shall not waive any such limitation or amend any such Benefit Plan to eliminate or materially alter such limitation. (f) Prior to making any written or oral communications to a broad-based group of the officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefits matters that are materially affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 5.12 shall (i) be deemed to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, contract or practice, or otherwise limit the right of the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates, to amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, contract or practice or (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.12. 5.13 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. Additionally, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in the event that (i) any Loan not otherwise listed on Schedule 4.02(t)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and which has an aggregate principal balance in excess of $1,000,000 becomes a Criticized Loan or (ii) it charges off any amounts outstanding in respect of any Loan in an aggregate amount of $500,000 or greater. 5.14 Third-Party Agreements. (a) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) the consents or waivers required to be obtained from any third parties in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (in such form and content as mutually agreed by the Parties) promptly after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the cooperation of such third parties (including at Parent’s request, with respect to the termination of Contracts following the Effective Time) to effect a smooth transition in accordance with the Parties’ timetable at or after the Effective Time.   -59-

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.14(a), each of the Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to provide data processing, item processing and other processing support or outside contractors to assist in performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of the data and other files and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parent’s production environment, in such a manner sufficient to ensure that a successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the Effective Time) mutually agreed by the Parties, subject to any applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. Among other things, the Company shall: (i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project plan to effectuate the conversion; (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Company’s outside contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and its ongoing needs until the conversion can be established; (iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably requested by Parent for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to the Company’s personnel and facilities and, with the consent of its outside contractors, its outside contractors’ personnel and facilities, to enable the conversion effort to be completed on schedule; and (v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the Contracts of outside data, item and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are bound when directed to do so by Parent. (c) Parent agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary business activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 5.15 Closing Financial Statements. At least eight (8) Business Days prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company shall provide Parent with the Company’s consolidated financial statements presenting the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the period from January 1, 2021 through the close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (the “Closing Financial Statements”); provided, however, that if the Effective Time of the Merger occurs on or before the fifteenth (15th) Business Day of the month, the Company shall have provided consolidated financial statements as of and through the second month preceding the Effective Time of the Merger. Such financial statements shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulatory accounting   -60-

principles and other applicable legal and accounting requirements, and reflect all period-end accruals and other adjustments. Such financial statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Company’s chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of the certificate, the financial condition of the Company in all material respects. Such Closing Financial Statements shall also reflect accruals for all Professional Fees incurred or expected to be incurred (whether or not doing so is in accordance with GAAP) and shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Company’s chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial statements meet the requirements of this Section 5.15. 5.16 NASDAQ and NYSE Matters. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting of the shares of Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall file with the NYSE any required notices or forms with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. 5.17 Section 16 Matters. Each of the Company Board and the Parent Board shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to exempt the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees of the Company who may become an officer or director of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company Board shall adopt resolutions that specify (A) the name of each individual whose disposition of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Equity Awards) is to be exempted, (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Equity Awards) to be disposed of by each such individual and (C) that the approval is granted for purposes of exempting the disposition from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3(e) of the Exchange Act and (ii) the Parent Board shall adopt resolutions that specify (A) the name of each individual whose acquisition of shares of Parent Common Stock is to be exempted, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be acquired by each such individual and (C) that the approval is granted for purposes of exempting the acquisition from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3(d) of the Exchange Act.

5.18 Takeover Statute. At all times prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall: (a) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger; and (b) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. 5.19 Bank Merger. Promptly after the Merger, the Bank Merger will occur, with BoC Bank as the surviving bank. The Parties agree that the Bank Merger will become effective immediately after the Effective Time. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties shall execute and cause to be filed applicable articles or certificates of merger and such other documents as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (the “Bank Merger Certificates”) immediately following the Effective Time. The effect of the Bank Merger shall be as provided in the National Bank Act and the rules and regulations of the OCC and § 4887 of the CFC, including any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder. 5.20 Trust Preferred Securities. Upon the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be performed by the Company under the indentures and guarantee agreements listed on Section 5.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to the trust capital securities issued by various trust business subsidiaries of the Company and assumed by the Company (collectively, the “Trust Preferred Securities”) and the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Trust Preferred Securities.

Upon approval of such Persons by the Parent Board (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), such directors shall be invited to join the Parent Board and the board of directors of BoC Bank effective as of the Effective Time, and Parent, through the Parent Board and subject to the Parent Board’s fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent, shall take all necessary action to nominate such directors for election to the Parent Board in the proxy statement relating to the first annual meeting of the stockholders of Parent following the Effective Time. 5.22 Tax Matters. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a “plan of reorganization” as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each Party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in Sections 6.02(e) and 6.03(f).

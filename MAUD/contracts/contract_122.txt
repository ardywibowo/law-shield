AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 


THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of December 20, 2020, by and among: Viasat, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”); Royal Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Acquisition Sub”); and RigNet, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A. 


RECITALS 


A. The parties intend that Acquisition Sub be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”) in accordance with this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”). Upon consummation of the Merger, Acquisition Sub will cease to exist and the Company will continue as the Surviving Corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. B. The Company Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and (iii) recommended that the Company’s stockholders adopt this Agreement. C. The Parent Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its stockholders; and (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection therewith, each on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. D. The board of directors of Acquisition Sub has: (i) determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of Acquisition Sub and its sole stockholder for Acquisition Sub to enter into this Agreement; (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and (iii) recommended that its sole stockholder adopt this Agreement. E. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, certain holders of shares of Company Common Stock have entered into a Support Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the “Support Agreement”), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, with Parent. F. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted as, a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 


AGREEMENT 


The parties to this Agreement, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the








________________


receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 


SECTION 1. THE MERGER 1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”) in the Merger and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. From and after the Effective Time, all the property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation and all of the debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall become the debts, obligations, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL. 1.2 Closing. The consummation of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall be held (a) at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, 12670 High Bluff Drive, San Diego, CA 92130, or (b) remotely by exchange of documents and signatures (or their electronic counterparts), in either case unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement, on a date to be designated jointly by Parent and the Company, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder and by applicable Legal Requirements, waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of all conditions to the parties’ respective obligations to effect the Merger set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions at the Closing, unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the “Closing Date.” Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Secretary of State”) and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with effecting the Merger. The Merger shall become effective on the date and at such time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as may be mutually agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective being referred to in this Agreement as the “Effective Time”). 1.3 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. (a) Subject to the requirements set forth in Section 4.10(a), at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated in its entirety as set forth in the form of certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation attached hereto as Exhibit C and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as set forth therein or by applicable Legal Requirement. (b) Subject to Section 4.10(a), at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in the bylaws of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving   2








________________


Corporation shall be “RigNet, Inc.” and, as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as set forth therein or by applicable Legal Requirement. 1.4 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and the Surviving Corporation’s Organizational Documents: (i) the directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation; and (ii) the officers of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation. 1.5 Conversion of Securities. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the Company’s treasury or are held directly by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Excluded Shares”) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof; (b) except as provided in Section 1.5(a), each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the per share consideration payable in accordance with this Section 1.5(b), the “Merger Consideration”); and (c) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 1.6 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed or converted into a different number or class or series of shares by reason of any stock split, division, subdivision, combination, change, exchange or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. Nothing in this Section 1.6 shall be construed to permit the parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with, or not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement. 1.7 Treatment of Equity Awards. (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option held by an individual who, as of immediately after the Effective Time, constitutes an “employee” of Parent within the   3








________________


meaning of Form S-8 that is outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or unvested, immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an “Assumed Company Option”) shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a Parent Option on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting, exercise and expiration provisions) as applied to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that: (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Company Option shall be determined by multiplying: (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole share; (ii) the per share exercise price of each Assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing: (A) the per share exercise price of the Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole cent; and (iii) all references to the “Company” in the applicable Company Equity Plans and the Company Option agreements will be references to Parent. (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each award of Company RSUs (i) that is held by an individual who, as of immediately after the Effective Time, constitutes an “employee” of Parent within the meaning of Form S-8, (ii) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) that vests solely on the basis of continued employment or service (as opposed to performance vesting) (each, an “Assumed Company RSU Award”) shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock upon vesting and shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock and shall otherwise remain subject to the same vesting, settlement and other terms and conditions that applied to the underlying Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that: (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Assumed Company RSU Award shall be determined by multiplying: (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time; by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number; and (ii) all references to the “Company” in the applicable Company Equity Plans and the Assumed Company RSU Award agreements will be references to Parent. (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all corporate action necessary to provide that (i) each Company Option that does not constitute an Assumed Company Option shall accelerate in full and be terminated for no consideration as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent not exercised prior to such time, (ii) each Company RSU (other than a Deferred RSU) that does not constitute an Assumed Company RSU Award shall accelerate in full and be settled in shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) each Deferred Time-Based RSU shall accelerate in full as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and be terminated and settled in shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in a manner intended to satisfy the plan termination requirements of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), and (iv) each Deferred Performance-Based RSU shall, to the extent such Deferred Performance-Based RSU would be vested immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, be terminated and settled in shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in a manner intended to satisfy the plan termination requirements of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). With respect to the Deferred Performance-Based RSUs, (x) performance conditions   4








________________


for any performance periods of the Company that have ended before the Effective Time will conclusively be based on the actual performance achieved, and (y) in the case of a performance period in which the last day occurs after the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall, in good faith, determine the portion of the award that shall become vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time based on the relevant terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement, and any unvested portion shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the termination and settlement of the Deferred RSUs in accordance with this Section 1.7(c) satisfies the plan termination requirements of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any Deferred RSU that Parent determines prior to the Effective Time is not eligible to be terminated in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such Deferred RSU will be treated as an Assumed Company RSU Award hereunder and payment of the underlying shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under such award following the Effective Time will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Equity Plan that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversions described in this Section 1.7 will be subject to such modifications, if any, as are required to cause the conversion to be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such option shall be determined subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall assume sponsorship of the Company Equity Plans; provided that references to the Company therein shall be deemed references to Parent and references to Company Common Stock therein shall be deemed references to Parent Common Stock, (ii) each Company Equity Award that has been converted in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including, without limitation, any vesting conditions, as had applied to the corresponding Company Equity Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for such terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to such adjustments as reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to give effect to the conversion or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock available for future issuance under the Company Equity Plans (which shares Parent may instead cause to make available for issuance under the Parent Equity Plan) shall be determined by adjusting the number of shares of Company Common Stock available for future issuance of awards under the Company Equity Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the Exchange Ratio (provided that, following the Effective Time, awards may only be granted with respect to such shares described in this clause (iii) to individuals who were not employees or consultants of Parent or its Subsidiaries or members of the Parent Board prior to the Effective Time). Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery with respect to all Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company RSU Awards. Parent shall file and cause to be effective as of no later than two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time, a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or other appropriate form under the Securities Act, relating to shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to all Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company RSU Awards, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to   5

remain effective for so long as such Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company RSU Awards remain outstanding. (e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of the Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company RSU Awards notices setting forth the effect of the Merger on such holders’ rights and describing the treatment of such awards in accordance with this Section 1.7. 1.8 No Fractional Shares. (a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued. (b) Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(b) (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5(b)) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holder’s certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Company Stock Certificates”) or book-entry positions representing non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Company Book- Entry Shares”) in accordance with Section 1.10, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, determined by multiplying such fraction by the Average Parent Stock Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this Section 1.8(b) is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange. 1.9 Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and all holders of Company Stock Certificates and of Company Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except (unless such holder is subject to Section 1.5(a)) the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(b), cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8(b) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.10(f); and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and no further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate or a Company Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.10.   6

1.10 Exchange of Certificates and Cancellation of Book-Entry Positions. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select Parent’s transfer agent or (after consultation with the Company) another reputable bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company to act as exchange agent with respect to the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”). Prior to or concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent: (i) certificates or evidence of book-entry shares representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5; and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.8(b). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 1.10(a), together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and any interest or other income with respect to such cash amount, are referred to collectively as the “Exchange Fund.” The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash available in the Exchange Fund in obligations, funds or accounts typical for (including having liquidity typical for) transactions of this nature as directed by Parent; provided that no losses on such investments shall affect the cash payable to former holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 1 (and Parent shall promptly deliver to the Exchange Agent cash in an amount sufficient to replenish any deficiency in the Exchange Fund). (b) With respect to Company Stock Certificates, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of the share represented by each such Company Stock Certificate (i) a notice advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a letter of transmittal in customary form and reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a Company Stock Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Certificate as provided in Section 1.10(e)) to the Exchange Agent (the “Letter of Transmittal”) and (iii) instructions for surrendering a Company Stock Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Stock Certificate as provided in Section 1.10(e)) to the Exchange Agent. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Stock Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Stock Certificate as provided in Section 1.10(e)) together with a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of the share represented by any such Company Stock Certificate in exchange therefor, as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, (i) a statement reflecting the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1 in non-certificated book-entry form in the name of such record holder (subject to Section 1.10(i)), and (ii) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 1.12) of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (B) any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1. Any Company Stock Certificate that has been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent. (c) With respect to Company Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC (each, a “Non-DTC Book-Entry Share”), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver to each holder of record of any Non-DTC Book-Entry Share, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter, the applicable Merger Consideration and a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as   7








________________


provided in Section 1.12) of any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1, and each Non-DTC Book-Entry Share shall be promptly cancelled by the Exchange Agent. Subject to Section 1.10(i), payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares are registered. (d) With respect to Company Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter, upon surrender of shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1. (e) In the event that any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in a reasonable and customary amount and upon such terms as may reasonably be required as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, payable or issuable pursuant to this Section 1, as if such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate had been surrendered. (f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger until the later to occur of: (A) the date on which the holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 1.10; and (B) the payment date for such dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest). (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares as of the date that is one year after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand. Any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 1.10 shall thereafter be entitled to look to Parent for, and be entitled to receive from Parent, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.8(b) and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.10(f).   8

(c) Parent maintains, and at all times since April 1, 2018 has maintained, a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Parent’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent’s system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and Parent’s independent registered accountant has issued an attestation report concluding that Parent maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020. Management of Parent has disclosed to Parent’s auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (x) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or any other employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the Company prior to the date hereof.

(b) Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto, or the suspension of the shares of Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC or its staff for any amendment of or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to as promptly as practicable have any stop order relating to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or any such suspension of the shares of Parent Common Stock lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of the parties shall promptly furnish the other parties all information concerning such party, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and (to the extent reasonably available to such party) stockholders that may be required by applicable Legal Requirements or reasonably requested by the other party or its Representatives in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 4.3. If, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, any party becomes aware of any information that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in order to make any statement therein, in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, not false or misleading with respect to a material fact, or in order to avoid the omission of a material fact necessary to make the statements in the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus not misleading, then such party: (A) shall promptly inform the other party thereof; (B) shall provide the other party (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus prior to it being filed with the SEC; (C) shall provide the other party with a copy of such amendment or supplement promptly after it is filed with the SEC; and (D) if mailing   50

The Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for determining the Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, other than: (1) to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is required by applicable Legal Requirements is disclosed to the Company’s stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to the Company’s stockholders within a reasonable amount of time (as determined by the Company Board in good faith after consultation with outside counsel) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting; (2) if required by applicable Legal Requirement or a request from the SEC or its Staff; or (3) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (B) the Company may, and if Parent so requests, shall, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement if, on the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, there would be insufficient votes to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, in which case, except in the case where the   51

Company Board has made a Company Change in Recommendation in compliance with Section 4.4(c) or Section 4.4(d), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts during any such postponement or adjournment to solicit and obtain such proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable; provided that without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, in the cases of clauses (A)(1) and (A)(2)), (x) no single such adjournment or postponement pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) shall be for more than five (5) Business Days, except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements and (y) all such adjournments and postponements together shall not cause the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting to be more than twenty (20) Business Days after the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled or, in the case of the foregoing clauses (A)(3) and (B), less than five (5) Business Days prior to the End Date. The Company shall, during the ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, keep Parent reasonably informed as to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting for which proxies have been received by the Company with respect to the Required Company Stockholder Vote and the number of such proxies authorizing the holder thereof to vote in favor of the Required Company Stockholder Vote. (b) Subject to Section 4.4(c) or Section 4.4(d), the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, including by Section 4.4(c) and Section 4.4(d): (i) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus; (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable (or publicly propose to do so) any Company Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail to publicly announce, within ten (10) Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the equity securities of the Company shall have been commenced by any third party other than Parent and its Affiliates (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to Section 4.4(a)), a statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the Company Board in respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to publicly announce that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer); or (iv) if requested by Parent, fail to issue, within ten (10) Business Days after a Company Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to Section 4.4(a)), a press release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a “Company Change in Recommendation”); (v) cause or permit the Company to enter into any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or other arrangement or understanding (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with Section 4.2(a)) contemplating or relating to a Company Acquisition Transaction; (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation inapplicable to any Company Acquisition Proposal or counterparty thereto; or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date) and to consummate and make effective, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary and advisable filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable Communications Laws or Antitrust Laws) (collectively, “Filings”) that are or may become necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date) all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Entity or third party (collectively, “Approvals”) that are or may become necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties.

Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements or any Governmental Entity, each of Parent and the Company shall: (i) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, letters, responses to requests, briefs and white papers before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such information; (iii) promptly provide the other party’s counsel with copies of all Filings, analyses, presentations, memoranda, letters, responses to requests, briefs and white papers (and a summary of any oral presentations) made or submitted by such party with or to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) consult with the other party in advance of any meeting, video conference or teleconference with any Governmental Entity and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Entity, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings, video conferences and teleconferences.

Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that it is Parent’s ultimate right to devise the strategy and direct all matters for obtaining Approvals under Antitrust Laws, including any Filings, submissions and communications with or to any Governmental Entity in connection therewith, and taking into account in good faith any comments of the Company relating to such strategy. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not be required to (and the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (i) shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, and (ii) shall, if requested in writing by Parent) offer, propose, negotiate, agree to, consent to, or effect any accommodation, concession, commitment, condition or remedy of any kind (financial or otherwise) to or with any Governmental Entity or any third party, by consent decree or otherwise, in connection with seeking or obtaining Approvals or consents for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or eliminating any objections or impediments by any Governmental Entity that would prevent, prohibit or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to (A) selling, licensing, transferring or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell, license, transfer or otherwise dispose of, assets (including Intellectual Property assets or licenses), businesses or interests, (B) creating, terminating, amending or assigning relationships, joint ventures or contractual rights or obligations or (C) agreeing to or implementing any restrictions, impairments, agreements or actions that limit the freedom of action with respect to, or limit or restrict the ability to own, manage, operate, conduct or retain, any assets, businesses or interests, in each case of clauses (A), (B) and (C), of Parent, the Company or their   56

(a) Upon reasonable prior notice, the Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the Company’s and its Subsidiaries personnel, properties, Contracts, filings with Governmental Entities and books and records and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all available information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to permit any inspection or provide other access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would: (i) violate any obligation of the Company under any Contract with respect to confidentiality or privacy; (ii) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine or similar legal privilege or protection; (iii) violate any Legal Requirement; or (iv) result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of any third parties or personal information that would expose the Company to the risk of liability; provided that in each case the Company shall inform Parent of the nature of the information being withheld, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to make alternative arrangements that would allow Parent (or its applicable Representative) access to such information. All information obtained by or provided to Parent and its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as “Confidential Information” of the Company for purposes of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

4.7 Publicity. Unless the Company has made a Company Change in Recommendation, Parent and the Company shall consult with one another prior to issuing, and shall provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment upon, any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such public announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirement or by the rules and regulations of Nasdaq (in which event Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such public announcement or statement in advance, and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto); provided that (i) each of the Company and Parent may make public announcements, statements or other disclosures concerning this Agreement or the Merger that consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous public announcements, statements or other disclosures made by the Company and/or Parent in compliance with this Section 4.7, (ii) each of the Company and Parent may make any public statements in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those participating in investor calls or industry conferences, so long as such statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the Company and/or Parent in compliance with this Section 4.7 and (iii) the Company need not consult with (or obtain the consent of) Parent in connection with any public announcement, statement or other disclosure to be issued or made with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Change in Recommendation. 4.8 Employee Matters. (a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to provide: (i) each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who continues employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) after the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) with an annual base salary or base wage rate (excluding overtime and shift differential) and a target annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the annual base salary or base wage rate and target annual cash bonus opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) each Continuing Employee with employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to either (x) those provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Plans, or (y) those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or Parent’s Subsidiaries; provided, however, that no defined benefit pension, post-retirement medical, deferred compensation, equity-based compensation, severance benefits, retention, change-in-control or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits provided prior to the Closing shall be taken into account for purposes of Parent’s obligations under this Section 4.8(a). (b) Parent shall or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to honor and maintain the Company Plans as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed in Part 4.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the “Change in Control Arrangements”) and provide, to each Continuing Employee, payments and benefits in accordance with the terms thereof, including on a termination of employment in a manner that   58

would entitle such Continuing Employee to payments or benefits under such Change in Control Arrangements. Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a “change in control” of the Company (or similar phrase) within the meaning of such Company Plans and the Company Equity Plans. (c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all service of the Continuing Employees to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to be recognized for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual and level of benefits with respect to, without limitation, each Parent Plan (including, but not limited to, any Parent Plan providing for vacation, paid time off or severance benefits, but excluding any equity compensation plan, defined benefit pension or post-retirement medical plan) pursuant to which service credit is provided to any Parent Employee, in each case in which any Continuing Employee will participate after the Effective Time and to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent or the Subsidiaries of Parent (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA to: (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements other than preexisting condition limitations, exclusions or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Continuing Employees and that have not been satisfied or waived as of the Effective Time under the analogous welfare benefit plan maintained for the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) recognize for each Continuing Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Continuing Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents under an analogous Company Plan during the plan year of such plan in which occurs the date on which the Continuing Employee begins participation in such Parent Plan. (d) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is reasonably necessary to terminate the Company’s 401(k) plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable prior review and comment by Parent) not later than the day preceding the Closing Date and (ii) following the Effective Time and as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Parent’s 401(k) plan (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”), permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans) to the Parent 401(k) Plan, in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account balance (including any promissory notes) distributed to such Continuing Employees from the Company 401(k) Plan.   59

The provisions in the Surviving Corporation’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the Organizational Documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be no less favorable in the aggregate to such directors and officers than such provisions contained therein and in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified (whether by merger, consolidation, division, operation of law or otherwise) for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals. 4.11 Stockholder Litigation.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver.

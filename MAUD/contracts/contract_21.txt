AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 


AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 7, 2021 (this “Agreement”), by and among Eastern Bankshares, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“Buyer”), Clarion Acquisition Corp., a Massachusetts corporation (“Merger Sub”), Century Bancorp, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“Company”), and Century Bank and Trust Company, a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and a wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined herein) of Company (“Company Bank”). 


BACKGROUND STATEMENTS: 


1. The Boards of Directors of Buyer, Merger Sub, Company and Company Bank have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Company (the “Merger”), so that Company is the surviving corporation (Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the “Interim Surviving Corporation”), and immediately following the Merger, the Interim Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Buyer (the “Holdco Merger”), so that the Buyer is the surviving corporation (Buyer, as the surviving corporation in the Holdco Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the “Surviving Corporation”). It is intended that the Merger be mutually interdependent with and a condition precedent to the Holdco Merger and that the Holdco Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced by this Agreement, be effected immediately following the Effective Time (as defined below) without further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of the parties hereto; and 2. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. In consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I 


THE MERGER 


1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, as amended (the “MBCA”), at the Effective Time (as defined herein), Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company. Company shall survive the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.








________________


1.2 Closing. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at 10:00 a.m., Boston time, remotely via the electronic exchange of closing deliverables, on a date which shall be no later than five (5) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Buyer and Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date”. (b) Buyer, in its sole discretion, may elect to extend the Closing Date by up to sixty (60) days so the Effective Time occurs on the business day immediately preceding the date on which Buyer commences the Information Systems Conversion (as defined herein), which conversion now is scheduled to commence on October 9, 2021. 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on or before the Closing Date, Company and Merger Sub shall cause to be filed articles of merger (the “Articles of Merger”) as provided under the MBCA with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Secretary of the Commonwealth”). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Articles of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MBCA, or at such other date and time as shall be provided by applicable law (such date and time, the “Effective Time”). The date on which the Effective Time occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Effective Date.” 1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the MBCA and this Agreement. 1.5 Holdco Merger. Immediately following the Merger, Company, as the Interim Surviving Corporation, will merge with and into Buyer in the Holdco Merger. Buyer shall survive the Holdco Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Upon consummation of the Holdco Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company shall terminate. 1.6 Effect of Merger on Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, Company, or the holder of any of the following securities: (a) Each share of the Class A Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Company (the “Class A Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of the Class B Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Company (the “Class B Common Stock,” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Company Common Stock”), except for (i) shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company or Buyer (in each case other than shares of Company Common Stock (A) held in any Company Benefit Plans (as defined herein) or related trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity and (B) held, directly or indirectly, in respect of debts previously contracted (collectively, the “Exception Shares”)) and (ii)   2








________________


Dissenting Shares (as defined herein), if any, shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive $115.28, without interest, in cash (the “Merger Consideration”) and dividends with respect to Company Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Time that was declared by Company on such Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Closing and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. (b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a “Certificate,” it being understood that any reference herein to “Certificate” shall be deemed to include reference to book- entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Company or Buyer (in each case other than the Exception Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 1.7 Merger Sub Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Interim Surviving Corporation. 1.8 Articles of Organization. At the Effective Time, the Company Articles (as defined herein), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Organization of the Interim Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The Buyer Articles (as defined herein), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Organization of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. 1.9 Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Company Bylaws (as defined herein), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Interim Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The Buyer Bylaws (as defined herein), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. 1.10 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Company, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the directors and officers of the Interim Surviving Corporation each of whom shall serve in accordance with the Articles of Organization of the Interim Surviving Corporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   3

1.11 Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share, if any, of Company Common Stock as to which the holder thereof (a) is entitled to appraisal, (b) has not voted in favor of this Agreement or the Merger or consented in writing thereto, and (c) has properly complied with Section 13.01 et seq. of the MBCA as to dissenters’ rights required to be complied with prior to the Effective Time (each such share, a “Dissenting Share”), such Dissenting Share shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead and in lieu thereof, shall have the right to receive payment from Buyer with respect to each such Dissenting Share in accordance with the MBCA; provided, however, that if such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder’s right to appraisal under the MBCA, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the MBCA, then each share of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate representing such share. Company shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Buyer shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of Buyer. 1.12 Bank Merger. Immediately following the Holdco Merger, Buyer will cause Company Bank to merge (the “Bank Merger”) with and into Eastern Bank, a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer (“Buyer Bank”). Buyer Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company Bank shall cease. Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer Bank and Company Bank shall enter into an agreement and plan of merger in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Bank Merger Agreement”). Each of Buyer and Company shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger as the sole shareholder of Buyer Bank and Company Bank, respectively. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall cause Company Bank, and Buyer shall cause Buyer Bank, to execute such certificates or articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to effectuate the Bank Merger (“Bank Merger Certificates”). 


ARTICLE II 


EXCHANGE OF SHARES 


2.1 Exchange Agent and Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer will enter into a customary agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Company with a paying agent designated by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to Company (the “Exchange Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable under Section 1.6 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”), which Exchange Fund, from and after the Effective Time, shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make all such payments, Buyer shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to make such payments. The Exchange Agent will deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in Section 2.7, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose.   4








________________


2.2 Exchange Procedures. Buyer will cause the Exchange Agent, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event no more than five (5) business days thereafter), and provided that Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.6 of this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, a check representing that amount of cash to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash constituting Merger Consideration. 2.3 Investment of Exchange Fund. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the cash in the Exchange Fund will be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Buyer, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than thirty (30) days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). No losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Buyer. 2.4 Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a person (as defined herein) other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the person requesting such payment has paid to Buyer (or any agent designated by Buyer) any transfer Taxes (as defined herein) required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Buyer (or any agent designated by Buyer) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.   5








________________


2.5 No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined herein), any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (as defined herein), become the property of Buyer, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 2.6 Distribution of Exchange Fund to Buyer. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Buyer upon demand, and any holder of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who has not theretofore surrendered or transferred such holder’s Certificate(s) representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Article II will thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates solely to Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.6. 2.7 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6. Buyer or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Buyer or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 2.8 Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Buyer and any Subsidiary of Buyer will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as will be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld they will be (a) paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity for crediting to the account of the person from whom such amounts were withheld, and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 


ARTICLE III 


REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY 


Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Company to Buyer and Merger Sub concurrently herewith (the “Company Disclosure Schedule”); provided, that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein), and (c) any disclosure made with respect to a section of this   6








________________


Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections, Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows: 3.1 Corporate Organization. (a) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is a bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”).

6.1 Regulatory Matters. (a) Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make such filings within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement. Buyer shall cooperate, and shall cause its affiliates to cooperate, with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including using reasonable best efforts to promptly furnish to Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to Buyer and its affiliates as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable law. Company will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments, if any, with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. As promptly practicable after Company’s receipt of confirmation by the SEC that the SEC does not intend to review the preliminary Proxy Statement or that the SEC has no further comments, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC and mail or deliver the definitive Proxy Statement to its shareholders. (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings (and in the case of the applications, notices, petitions and filings required to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, use their reasonable best efforts to make such filings within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement), to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental Entities. Buyer and Company shall each use, and shall each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Requisite Regulatory Approval and any approvals required for the Bank Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection therewith (including the furnishing of any information and any reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be required to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals) and shall respond as promptly as practicable to the requests of Governmental Entities for documents and information. Buyer and Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to Company or Buyer, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party will provide the other with copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to filing and with sufficient opportunity to comment, other   41

than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information or confidential supervisory information filed under a claim of confidentiality. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; provided, that each party shall promptly advise the other party with respect to substantive matters that are addressed in any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity which the other party does not attend or participate in, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and applicable law. (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer, Merger Sub and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer, Merger Sub or Buyer Bank be required to (x) agree to any prohibition, limitation, condition or other requirement which would (A) prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries of all or any material portion of the business or assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries, (B) compel Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) compel Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or request, if the prohibition, limitation, condition or other requirement described in clauses (A)-(C) of this sentence could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the future operation by Buyer and its Subsidiaries of the combined businesses and operations of Buyer Bank and Company Bank, taken as a whole (together, the “Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition”). (d) Buyer and Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Buyer, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Buyer and Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the time of filing and the date of mailing to the respective shareholders of Company and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading, and (iii) any applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will, at the time each is filed,   42








________________


contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of Buyer and Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Proxy Statement. (e) Buyer and Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. 6.2 Access to Information. (a) Subject to Section 9.7, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws (including the Pandemic Measures), Company, for the purposes of allowing Buyer to verify the representations and warranties of the other and to prepare for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to Buyer’s officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of Company’s properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time the conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, during normal business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere with normal business operations, Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the other party’s regular business operations during any such access. Neither Buyer nor Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Buyer’s or Company’s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or to the extent that Company or Buyer, as the case may be, reasonably determines, in light of the Pandemic or the Pandemic Measures that such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any of its employees. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.   43

(b) From and after the date hereof, representatives of Buyer and Company shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the efficient and orderly combination of Company and Buyer and Company Bank and Buyer Bank, including the conversion of Company’s data processing and related electronic informational systems to those used by Buyer with the goal of conducting such conversion simultaneously with the consummation of the Merger (the “Information Systems Conversion”). In connection therewith, the parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to provide customers with any communications and/or notices that are necessary or advisable; provided, however, that Company in its discretion may elect to defer any such customer communication or notice until the later of Company Shareholder Approval or the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals (excluding any waiting period in respect thereof). The Information Systems Conversion shall include, but not be limited to: (a) discussion of third party service provider arrangements of Company and any of its Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal, after the Effective Time, of personal property leases and software licenses used by Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the systems operations; (c) retention of outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion; (d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the Effective Time, of proprietary or self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate the conversion, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. Each party shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with related service providers and other parties). (c) Each of Buyer and Company shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party’s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated February 22, 2021, between Buyer and Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”). (d) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations. 6.3 Company Shareholder Approval. (a) Company shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the “Company Meeting”) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event, no later than forty-five (45) days after the date of the Proxy Statement) for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote. Except in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined herein), the Board of Directors of Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Company Board Recommendation”) and shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with this Section 6.3. As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Company shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Buyer to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Requisite Company Vote.   44








________________


However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if (i) the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) which has not been withdrawn and (ii) the Board of Directors of Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement and the Merger, then, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, in submitting this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of Company may withhold, withdraw or amend or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Buyer and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company Board Recommendation or may submit this Agreement and the Merger to its shareholders without recommendation (each, a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change”) (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded), in which event the Board of Directors of Company may communicate the basis for its Company Adverse Recommendation Change to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto. (b) Except in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Class A Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Class A Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the shareholders of Company at the Company Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Company of such obligation. Company shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting two (2) times pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b). 6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts, in each case as promptly as practicable, (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by Company or Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 6.5 Employee Matters. (a) Employees of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the “Continuing Employees”) shall become employees at will of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Buyer shall, and shall cause Buyer Bank to, provide to the Continuing Employees annual   45

base salary or base wages (as applicable) at least equal to the level that was provided to each such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply to any of the Continuing Employees listed on Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Beginning as of the Effective Date and continuing through the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Date, Company employees whose positions have been or could reasonably be expected to be eliminated as a consequence of the Merger will be given the opportunity to apply and be considered for any open position at Buyer Bank for which they are qualified, as if they were internal candidates of Buyer. For a period beginning on the Effective Date and continuing through the first (1st) anniversary thereof, each Continuing Employee who is not party to an individual agreement providing for severance or termination benefits and is terminated under severance qualifying circumstances, as defined on Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall be eligible to receive severance benefits and medical and dental coverage as set forth on Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to such employee’s timely execution (and non-revocation) of a standard release of claims. (b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Buyer or its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans to the extent waiver of such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan that provides health care benefits (including medical, dental and vision) or disability benefits, to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes of eligibility and vesting in any New Plan; provided, that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, (C) for purposes of the minimum number of hours required during a plan year to receive an allocation under Buyer’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan, (D) for purposes of any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits, or (E) for purposes of any equity incentive awards granted by Buyer. (c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to (i) assume and honor the terms and agreements with the Continuing Employees identified on Section 6.5(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance with their terms as of the date hereof; (ii) honor the agreements set forth on Section 6.5(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; (iii) assume Company’s obligations under the defined benefit pension plan set forth on Section 6.5(c)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iv) continue to provide retiree medical benefits to the individual set forth on Section 6.5(c)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule on the same terms and conditions as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including such rights relating to the modification or termination of such retiree medical benefits.   46

(d) Buyer shall designate, in consultation with Company, Continuing Employees who will be entitled to receive a “retention” bonus from Buyer (each a “Designated Employee” and collectively, the “Designated Employees”) in the event such Designated Employee remains an employee of Buyer as of the Effective Time and through a post-Closing date determined by Buyer (which date shall not be more than ninety (90) days after the Effective Time) (the “Transition Period”), or if Buyer terminates such Designated Employee’s employment after the Effective Time and during the Transition Period without cause (which shall mean gross negligence or dereliction in the performance of such Designated Employee’s duties, dishonesty or commission of a crime (excluding any traffic violation, minor misdemeanor or similar offense that would not reasonably be expected to reflect adversely on the business or reputation of Buyer), in each case as determined in good faith by Buyer). The aggregate amount of such retention bonuses for all Designated Employees and the timing of each such bonus payment relative to the Effective Time shall be determined by Buyer, with selection of such Designated Employees made by Buyer in consultation with Company. Buyer and Company expect that retention bonuses shall not be payable to any Continuing Employee who is a party to an employment or other agreement that provides severance benefits in the event of a change in control of Company. (e) If requested by Buyer in writing at least twenty (20) business days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Company (the “Company 401(k) Plan”) to be terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Buyer requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Date, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries (a “Buyer 401(k) Plan”). Company and Buyer shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or Buyer 401(k) Plan to permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions to the Buyer 401(k) Plan of “eligible rollover distributions” (with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof. Company shall provide Buyer with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 6.5(e); provided, that prior to amending or terminating the Company 401(k) Plan, Company shall provide the form and substance of any applicable resolutions or amendments to Buyer for review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (f) On and after the date hereof, any broad-based employee notices or communication materials (including any website posting) to be provided or communicated by Company with respect to employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and reasonable comment of Buyer, and Company shall consider in good faith revising such notice or communication to reflect any comments or advice that Buyer timely provides. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of Company, Buyer, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, nor shall anything in this Agreement interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Company, Buyer or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,   47

amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) except as set forth herein, alter or limit the ability of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.12, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 6.6 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee of Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Company Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer shall also advance expenses as incurred by the Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall maintain in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Company (provided, that Buyer may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that Buyer shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid by Company for the most recently commenced policy year for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Buyer shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in its good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Buyer, may (and at the request of Buyer, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year “tail” policy under Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap. If Company purchases such a tail policy, Buyer shall maintain such tail policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.   48

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then in each case, Buyer or Merger Sub, as applicable, will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or Merger Sub, as applicable, will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6. (d) The obligations of Buyer, Merger Sub and Company under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.6 without the prior written consent of the affected person. 6.7 Advice of Changes. (a) Buyer and Company shall each promptly advise the other party of any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development known to it (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.7 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. (b) If the Closing Date is delayed pursuant to Section 1.2(b), Company shall deliver to Buyer as of the Bringdown Date a supplement to the Company Disclosure Schedule (the “Company Disclosure Supplement”) which shall include any matter hereafter arising that, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Schedule or that is necessary to correct any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or in any representation or warranty of Company which has been rendered inaccurate thereby following discovery thereof.   49

6.8 Financial Statements and Other Current Information. As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement, Company shall furnish to Buyer (a) consolidated financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and shareholders’ equity) of Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of and for such month then ended, (b) internal management financial control reports showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period, including a summary of fees that Company and its Subsidiaries have paid to retained advisors in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (c) any reports provided to the Board of Directors of Company or any committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk management of Company and its Subsidiaries. All information furnished by Company to Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be held in confidence to the same extent of Buyer’s obligations under Section 6.2(b). 6.9 Acquisition Proposals. (a) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) knowingly engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or knowingly participate in any discussions with, any person relating to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of Company, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, a Company Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.9(a); provided, that, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, in the event Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that (A) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or (B) its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined herein) and; provided, further, that, prior to or concurrently with providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Company. Company will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Buyer with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. Company will promptly (and in any event within one (1) business day) advise Buyer following receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal) and will keep Buyer reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law and the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Company, to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.   50








________________


During the term of this Agreement, Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.9(a)) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, “Company Acquisition Proposal” shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, inquiry or proposal relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of Company and its Subsidiaries or twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of Company, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination, reorganization or similar transaction involving Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of Company. As used in this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” shall mean a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal (with all of the percentages included in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) received after the date hereof that was not solicited or negotiated in breach of this Section 6.9, that the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, such proposal (A) is reasonably likely to be completed in accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the person making such proposal, and (B) would be more favorable to the shareholders of Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either party or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act (the “Rules”) with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to such party’s shareholders; provided, that such Rules and disclosures will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules or any such disclosures would otherwise have under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the issuance of a “stop, look and listen” statement (or other similar statement pursuant to any requirement of applicable law), without more, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 6.10 Public Announcements. Company and Buyer shall each use their reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect of (i) any announcement required by applicable law or regulation, or a request by a Governmental Entity, (ii) communications that are substantially similar to communications previously approved pursuant to this Section 6.10, (iii) communications permitted by Section 6.3 or (iv) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, Company and Buyer agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   51

6.11 Change of Method. Buyer may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger if and to the extent requested by Buyer, and Company agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Buyer may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to Company’s shareholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed. 6.12 Certain Tax Matters. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: (a) timely file (taking into account any extensions of time within which to file) all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past practice; (b) timely pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns that are so filed; (c) establish an accrual in its books and records and financial statements in accordance with past practice for all Taxes payable by it for which a Tax Return is due prior to the Effective Time; and (d) promptly notify Buyer of any suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit pending against or with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matter, including, without limitation, Tax liabilities and refund claims. 6.13 Classified Loans. Company shall promptly after the end of each quarter after the date hereof and upon Closing provide Buyer with a complete and accurate list, including the amount, of all Loans subject to each type of classification of the Classified Loans. 6.14 Takeover Restrictions. Neither Company nor Buyer shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Restriction to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Buyer and Company shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Restriction now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Restriction may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Buyer and Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Restriction on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Restriction. 6.15 Litigation and Claims. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and Company shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law and regulation, promptly notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, Merger Sub or Company, as applicable,   52

Company shall give Buyer the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against Company and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Buyer’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 6.16 Assumption of Company Debt. Effective at the Effective Time (or at the effective time of the Bank Merger for any debt of Company Bank), Buyer or Buyer Bank, as applicable, shall, to the extent permitted thereunder and required thereby, assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be performed by Company or Company Bank pursuant to the definitive documents governing the short-term and long-term borrowings set forth on Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the due and punctual payment of the principal of such borrowings (and premium, if any) and interest thereon. In connection therewith, (i) Buyer and Company shall, and shall cause Buyer Bank and Company Bank respectively to, cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any supplemental indentures, if applicable, and (ii) Company shall, and shall cause Company Bank to, use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any officer’s certificates or other documents, and to provide any opinions of counsel to the trustee thereof, in each case, required to make such assumption effective as of the Effective Time or the effective time of the Bank Merger, as applicable. 6.17 Assumption of Company Split Dollar Insurance Agreements.

(a) Upon Buyer’s reasonable request, prior to the Closing Date and following receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval and all approvals of the Governmental Entities required under Section 7.1(c) (and without having to allow any waiting periods under such approvals to expire) and consistent with GAAP and subject to applicable banking laws and regulations, Company shall give due consideration to Buyer’s request that Company or its Subsidiaries divest itself of such investment securities and loans as are identified by Buyer in writing from time to time prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that no such divestitures need be made prior to the Closing. (b) No accrual or reserve or change in policy or procedure, or any divestiture of investment securities or loans, made by Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the request of Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.18 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustment shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of Company or its management with any such adjustments.   53

(e) by either Buyer or Company (provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Company, in the case of a termination by Buyer, or Buyer, in the case of a termination by Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Buyer, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by Company, and which is not cured by the earlier of the Termination Date and forty-five (45) days following written notice to Company, in the case of a termination by Buyer, or Buyer, in the case of a termination by Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period; or (f) by Buyer, prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if Company or the Board of Directors of Company (i) withholds, withdraws, modifies or qualifies in a manner adverse to Buyer the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) fails to make the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) adopts, approves, recommends or endorses a Company Acquisition Proposal or publicly announces an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fails to publicly and without qualification (A) recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Company Meeting) after a Company Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by Buyer to do so, or (v) materially breaches its obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.9. 


The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected. 8.2 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Buyer or Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Buyer, Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) and this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.13) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination. “Willful Breach” shall mean a material breach of, or material failure to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching or non-performing party with actual knowledge that such party’s act or failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in or constitute such breach of or such failure of performance under this Agreement.   57

(b)     (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of Company or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the Company Meeting) a Company Acquisition Proposal with respect to Company and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Buyer or Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(e), and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Company Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Buyer, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $25,670,000.00 (the “Termination Fee”); provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal to “twenty-five percent (25%)” shall instead refer to “fifty percent (50%)”. (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then Company shall pay Buyer, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of termination (and in any event, within three (3) business days thereafter). (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting Section 8.2(d) or the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other party’s fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement, the maximum aggregate amount of fees, liabilities or damages payable by Company, Buyer or Merger Sub under this Section 8.2 shall be equal to the Termination Fee. In no event shall Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. (c) Each of Buyer, Merger Sub Company and Company Bank acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Company fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” (as announced by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and this Section 8.2(d), constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the other party in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such applicable section.   58

8.3 Reservation of Rights. Nothing in this Article VIII shall in any way limit the right of Buyer, Merger Sub or Company to seek damages, specific performance, or any remedy at law or in equity arising out of a Willful Breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement by the other party hereto.

Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote; provided, however, that after the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, there may not be, without further approval of the Company shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires such further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 9.3 Extension; Waiver.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 9.4 Expenses.

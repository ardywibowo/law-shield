(b)    To the extent the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by this Article 2 or affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable hereunder, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) the Payment Fund shall not be invested in any instruments other than direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the government of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers’ acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall become part of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent and the Withholding Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock and the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock.   18

   (c)    Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than 102 Company Shares) at the Effective Time whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.03(a) a letter of transmittal and instructions in customary form reasonably satisfactory to the Company which shall (i) specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.04(g)) to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange and (ii) request for a tax residency declaration and/or a Valid Withholding Certificate and any other information necessary for Parent to determine whether any amounts need to be withheld from the Merger Consideration payable to such Person pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance (in each case, subject to the terms of the Withholding Tax Ruling, if obtained), the Code or any other provision of U.S. state or local or non- U.S. Applicable Law. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of shares of Company Common Stock, and, in each case, delivery to the Exchange Agent of such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent. Until so surrendered or transferred, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.   (d)    If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable and (iii) the Withholding Agent was provided with a Valid Withholding Certificate or any other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Withholding Agent.   (e)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Merger Consideration, Option Payment, SAR Payment, RSU Payment or PSU Payment payable in respect of 102 Company Securities or 3(i) Company Options shall be transferred, in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.04, to the 102 Trustee, for the benefit of the beneficial owners thereof, and be released by the 102 Trustee to the beneficial owners of such 102 Company Securities or 3(i) Company Options in accordance with the requirements of Section 102 of the Ordinance, the Interim Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax Ruling, if obtained.   (f)    All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.   19

(h)    Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration.   Section 2.05    Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.03, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing, who is entitled to appraisal and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, following which such shares shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder’s right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.03(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands.

   Section 4.01    Organization, Standing and Power. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and it has all corporate powers and authority that are necessary to carry on its business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its properties and assets. The Company and the Specified Subsidiaries are each duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company has Made Available complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and comparable charter or organizational documents of each of the Specified Subsidiaries as currently in effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Specified Subsidiaries is in violation of their respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable charter or organizational documents, each as amended to date, in any material respect.   Section 4.02    Corporate Authorization.   (a)    The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to the Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for obtaining the Stockholder Approval, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The only vote of holders of any class of capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement, approve the Merger and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the DGCL and the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws is the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, voting together as a single class (such vote, the “Stockholder Approval”). No other vote or approval of any class or series of securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar Applicable Laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.   (b)    At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company Board unanimously duly adopted resolutions (i) determining and declaring that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Replacement) are advisable and in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders, (ii) approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) directing that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholder Meeting and (iv) recommending adoption of this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company (the “Company Recommendation”), which resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn, except as permitted in Section 6.03. The Company is not party to and does not have in force any stockholder rights agreement or “poison pill” or similar anti- takeover agreement or plan. Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 5.10 are true and correct, the Company Board has taken all necessary action so that Section 203 of the DGCL or any similar anti-takeover, moratorium, or “control share” law applicable to the Company does not, and will not, apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   27

(iii)    Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.03(a), at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor and outside legal counsel, it being understood that with respect to the matter described in clause (y) below, only consultation with outside legal counsel shall be required), that (x) an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing, and (y) the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, however, that no such Adverse Recommendation Change may be made:   (A)    until after the third Business Day (or such shorter period that may apply pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 6.03(b) (iii)) following written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the material facts underlying the determination by the Company Board that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reason for the Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail (a “Notice of Intervening Event”);   (B)    unless, during such three Business Day period (or such shorter period that may apply pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 6.03(b)(iii)), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change; and   60

   (C)    unless, following the expiration of such three Business Day period (or such shorter period that may apply pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 6.03(b)(iii)) , the Company Board determines in good faith, taking into consideration any amendments to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent (after consultation with outside legal counsel), that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that if Parent makes a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Company Board determines that such Intervening Event no longer requires an Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly enter into amendments to such agreements to embody the terms of such proposal).   The provisions of this Section 6.03(b)(iii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, in which case such change shall require a new Notice of Intervening Event and the Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions of this Section 6.03(b)(iii), but in such case the three Business Day period referenced in this Section 6.03(b)(iii) shall be only (x) two Business Days following each of up to two new Notices of Intervening Event and (y) one Business Day following any additional Notice of Intervening Event.   (c)    Nothing contained in Section 6.02 or this Section 6.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or any committee thereof, after consultation with outside legal counsel, such disclosure is required under Applicable Law, or (iii) making any disclosure that constitutes a stop, look and listen communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that (x) the Company may only make any such disclosure that constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 6.03(b) and (y) any such disclosure that does not also contain an express reaffirmation by the Company Board of the Company Recommendation shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.   Section 6.04    Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders’ Meeting.   (a)    As promptly as practicable (and in any event within fifteen Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare a proxy statement in preliminary form (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the “Proxy Statement”) for a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders (including any adjournments and postponements thereof, the “Stockholder Meeting”) and file it with the SEC, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the foregoing, including to collect from their respective Affiliates, as applicable, any necessary information for the preparation of the foregoing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with copies of all material correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company, and shall collect from their Affiliates any necessary information, in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under Applicable Law. Parent shall ensure that such information supplied by it and its Affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholder meeting, contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC or any proxy advisory firm (including ISS, Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall consider Parent’s comments in good faith. The Company shall pay all filing fees required to be paid to the SEC in connection with the Proxy Statement.   61

   (b)    The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. If, prior to the Stockholder Meeting, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub discovers that information supplied by Parent and its Affiliates in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party hereto which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the Company’s stockholders. For the avoidance of doubt, no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made (or incorporated by reference) in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (c)    As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC (and in any event within five Business Days after clearance by the SEC), the Company shall conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Applicable Law and duly set a record date for the Stockholder Meeting and cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form and notice of the Stockholder Meeting to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders, the Company shall in accordance with Applicable Law and the Company’s organizational documents, convene and hold the Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the matters requiring Stockholder Approval; provided that notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholder Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholder Meeting, (iii) after consultation with Parent, to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Stockholder Meeting, (iv) after consultation with Parent, to allow for additional time for the solicitation of proxies in order to obtain the Stockholder Approval, or (v) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting by Applicable Law, provided, however, that the Company may not postpone the Stockholders Meeting for more than an aggregate of twenty Business Days without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall consult with Parent to set the record date for the Stockholder Meeting and shall not change the record date or set a new record date for the Stockholder Meeting without consulting with Parent in good faith. Unless the Company Board or any committee thereof has made an Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section 6.03, the Company shall (x) make the Company Recommendation to the stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (y) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders and to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (z) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock required by Applicable Law to effect the Merger. In the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall continue to submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for approval at the Stockholder Meeting unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Stockholder Meeting.   62

Subject to Applicable Law and applicable contractual restrictions, from the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, (i) upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent’s officers and Parent’s other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to its properties, books, Contracts, personnel, Tax Returns and records (including via remote or electronic means) and (ii) the Company shall notify Parent in writing (in accordance with Section 9.01) of any Customer or Supplier Adverse Event as promptly as practicable after the occurrence thereof.

Any such access pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be conducted at Parent’s sole cost and expense under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary. Any access to the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives not to, (i) contact any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the Company’s prior written consent (such consent not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and in any case to be decided upon by the Company within one Business Day of Parent’s written request for such consent), or (ii) have any discussion regarding the Company with any customer, vendor or supplier of the Company without providing the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate in such discussion; provided that, for purposes of clause (ii), if Parent’s outside regulatory counsel advises, after reasonable consultation with, and agreement by, the Company’s outside regulatory counsel, that it is advisable for Parent not to have joint discussions with the Company and any applicable customer, vendor or supplier of the Company in order to comply with Applicable Law, then Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives shall be permitted to have such discussion without providing the Company with an opportunity to participate. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be directed to the Persons designated by the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.05 shall require the Company to permit the inspection of, or to disclose, any information regarding or related to the deliberations of the Company Board with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the entry into this Agreement or any materials provided to the Company Board in connection therewith. All such information provided by or behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.     63

   Section 6.06    Notice of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other informed on a reasonably current basis of any material developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of (i) the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (x) with respect to the Company, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (y) with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and/or (z) would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article 7 not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date, or (ii) any written notice or other written communication that has been received by the Company from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No notification given by any party pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   Section 6.07    Employee Benefit Plan Matters.   (a)    As of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date (“Continuing Employees”), Parent shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate in, and levels of benefits (but not for purposes of any equity or equity-based compensation, long- term incentive, change in control, retention or other one-time or special incentive compensation, defined benefit pension or retiree medical or similar benefits other than pension arrangements (collectively, “Enumerated Benefits”)) under, each compensation, retirement, vacation, paid time off, fringe, pension arrangement, study fund, severance or other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Parent Benefit Plans”) in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent service was credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.   (b)    For a period of twelve months after the Closing Date (or, if shorter, for so long as the applicable Continuing Employee remains employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries), the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary will (or Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary to) provide each Continuing Employee with (i) (A) annual base salary or base hourly rate and (B) cash and equity incentive compensation opportunities (including commissions and Enumerated Benefits) and (ii) employee benefits (including the Enumerated Benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of the Company and or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.   64

   (c)    From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is an “employee welfare benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary to, cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, actively-at-work requirement, required physical examinations and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, actively- at-work requirement, required physical examinations and other restriction would not have applied or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his or her commencement of participation in such Parent Benefit Plan; provided, however, that for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility conditions based on periods of employment, Section 6.07(a) shall control; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee commences participation in such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such expenses were recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company Employee Plan.   (d)    Parent shall comply with the covenant and acknowledgement set forth in Section 6.07(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to the 2021 NEO Bonuses. Following the Effective Time, Continuing Employees shall participate in Parent’s bonus plans and programs and earn pro-rated bonus payments for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending at the end of Parent’s fiscal year 2022.   (e)    The Company shall permit, and cause its Subsidiaries to permit, Parent to contact and make arrangements with the Company’s or its Subsidiary’s employees regarding employment or prospective employment with the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time and for the purpose o f ensuring the continuity of the business, and the Company agrees not to discourage, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to discourage, any such employees from consulting with Parent.   (f)    Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall be deemed to (i) amend any Parent Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue or amend any particular benefit plan before or after the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law, (ii) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of, any Continuing Employee for any reason, (iii) constitute the establishment or amendment of any benefit or compensation plan, policy, agreement or other arrangement on the part of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or (iv) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee, any other employee, officer, director, independent contractor of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person.   Section 6.08    State Takeover Laws. If any “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “moratorium” or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions within their respective authority as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.   65

Section 6.10    Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote any shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting, and will vote or cause to be voted the shares of Merger Sub held by it or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in favor of adoption of this Agreement immediately following the execution of this Agreement and shall provide a copy of the certified vote or written consent to the Company.   Section 6.11    Director and Officer Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.   (a)    For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers’ and directors’ liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Company’s officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.11(a), neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the “Current Premium”) and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporation’s good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid “tail” or “runoff” policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such persons currently covered by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If any such prepaid policies described in this Section 6.11(a) have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain any and all such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.   (b)    From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof between the Company and each individual who (x) at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company or (y) is listed on Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each such individual in clause (x) or (y), an “Indemnified Party”), the form of which has been Made Available; and (ii) any indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses subject to the undertaking in this Section 6.11 to repay advanced amounts) and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof. Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.   (c)    If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.   66

   (d)    The provisions of this Section 6.11 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (x) such termination or modification is required by Applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11); provided, however, that such rights of the Indemnified Parties as third party beneficiaries under this Section 6.11 shall not arise until the Effective Time.   Section 6.12    Further Action; Regulatory Approvals; Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities, make all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to deliver required notices to, and to obtain the required consents or waivers from, third parties, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.   (b)    Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.12, each of the Company, Parent and Parent’s Affiliates shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry or Proceeding by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry or Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority to the extent regarding the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or regarding any such request, inquiry or Proceeding, and provide a copy of all written communications to the other parties (except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Applicable Law).  Subject to Applicable Law, in advance and to the extent practicable, each of Parent, Parent’s Affiliates or the Company, as the case may be, will consult the other on all the information relating to Parent, Parent’s Affiliates or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.12 and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or the Company, as the case may be.  Each of the Company, Parent and Parent’s Affiliates agrees not to participate in any meeting(s) with any Governmental Authority in respect of any submission, notification or investigation under any Antitrust Law with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless such party consults with the other party in advance. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Applicable Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry or Proceeding in respect of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Parent’s Affiliates will permit authorized Representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry or Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with such request, inquiry or Proceeding. Parent shall cause its Affiliates to make filings, registrations and declarations, deliver notices, documents, reports and submissions, execute and deliver instruments, and provide information as required in connection with this Section 6.12 and otherwise to comply with the obligations set forth in this Section 6.12 specifically applicable to them, and any failure by any of its Affiliates to comply with such obligations contained in this Section 6.12 shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent.   67

Each of the parties hereto shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.   Section 6.21    Tax Rulings.   (a)    The Company, in full coordination with Parent, shall prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling (which shall be confirmed by Parent’s advisors prior to its submission) confirming that: (i) Parent shall be exempt from withholding Tax in relation to payments made under this Agreement to the Exchange Agent, the 102 Trustee or the Withholding Agent in relation to any 102 Company Securities and 3(i) Company Options; (ii) the payment of any consideration upon the cancelation or purchase of 102 Company Securities with respect to which the requisite period has not passed will not constitute a violation of the requirements of Section 102 of the Ordinance as long as such consideration is deposited with the 102 Trustee; (iii) the cancelation of unvested 102 Company Securities and the replacement thereof with Parent RSUs in accordance with Section 2.06 will not trigger a taxable event; and (iv) the tax treatment under Section 102(b)(2) of the Ordinance will apply to such Parent RSUs (which ruling may be subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling and which may include additional issues which are raised by the ITA in light of the factual background of the ruling request) (the “Option Tax Ruling”).

To the extent the Interim Option Tax Ruling is obtained, all references herein to the Option Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to such Interim Option Tax Ruling, until such time that a final definitive Option Tax Ruling is obtained. For the avoidance of doubt, the final language of the Option Tax Ruling and the Interim Option Tax Ruling shall be subject to the pre-approval of Parent.   70

Should any meeting be held with the ITA which Parent’s counsel does not attend, the Company’s counsel shall provide Parent and its counsel with an update of such meeting or discussion.

Section 9.07    Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, or if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement brought by any party against any other party, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereto agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 9.01 or in any other manner permitted by law.   Section 9.08    Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.   Section 9.09    Specific Performance.   (a)    The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such harm. It is accordingly agreed that, unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 and any dispute over the right of termination has been finally resolved, (i) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 9.07 and, in any action for specific performance, each party waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement), and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and without that right, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other of such parties has an adequate remedy at law or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any reason.   78

   (b)    The parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.09, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 9.09 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 9.09 shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 9.09 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article 8, nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.09 or anything set forth in this Section 9.09 restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 8 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time.   Section 9.10    Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or by Section 211(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law or other applicable law, whenever the stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at any meeting, such action may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if (i) a consent or consents in writing to such action, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by holders of issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and (ii) the consent or consents so signed shall be delivered to the Corporation or the Secretary of the Corporation. Every such written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no such written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered as provided above in this Section, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action are delivered to the Corporation or the Secretary of the Corporation.

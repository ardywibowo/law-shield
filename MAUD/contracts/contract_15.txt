AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 


THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of March 9, 2021, by and between WSFS Financial Corporation (“WSFS”), a Delaware corporation, and Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation (“Bryn Mawr”), a Pennsylvania corporation. 


Preamble 


The board of directors of Bryn Mawr has approved this Agreement and determined and declared that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of Bryn Mawr and its shareholders. 


The board of directors of WSFS has approved this Agreement and determined and declared that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of WSFS and its stockholders. 


Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “PBCL”) and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), Bryn Mawr will merge with and into WSFS (the “Merger”), with WSFS as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Corporation”). 


Simultaneously with the Merger, Bryn Mawr Bank, a Pennsylvania chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of The Bryn Mawr Trust Company (“Bryn Mawr Bank”) or a successor thereof, will merge with and into Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, a federal savings bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of WSFS (“WSFS Bank”), with WSFS Bank as the surviving bank, sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Bank” (the “Bank Merger,” and together with the Merger, the “Mergers”). 


As a condition and an inducement for WSFS to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and each of the executive officers of Bryn Mawr have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (each a “Bryn Mawr Voting Agreement”), in the form of Exhibit A. 


As a condition and an inducement for WSFS’s willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain employees of Bryn Mawr set forth on Exhibit B hereto have simultaneously herewith entered into service agreements with WSFS, in form and substance acceptable to WSFS and such employees of Bryn Mawr, to be effective upon the Closing (the “Service Agreements”). 


It is the intention of the Parties that the Merger and the Bank Merger for federal income tax purposes shall each qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue Code for each such Merger. 


The Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Mergers and also to prescribe to certain conditions to the Mergers.

(b)              Each share of Bryn Mawr Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by Bryn Mawr, any Bryn Mawr Subsidiary, WSFS or any WSFS Subsidiary (in each case other than shares held in any Employee Benefit Plans or related trust accounts or otherwise held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) (collectively, the “Canceled Shares”) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 


(c)              Each share of Bryn Mawr Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding the Canceled Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, 0.90 of a share (the “Exchange Ratio”) of WSFS Common Stock (the “Merger Consideration”).

________________






(d)              Each share of Bryn Mawr Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a “Certificate”) or book-entry share (a “Book-Entry Share”) registered in the transfer books of Bryn Mawr that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Bryn Mawr Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with ARTICLE 3, including the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 2.4, cash in lieu of fractional shares of WSFS Common Stock into which such shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock have been converted together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 3.1(d). 


2.2.         Anti-Dilution Provisions. 


Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and subject to Sections 6.2(d) and (e), if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock or the issued and outstanding shares of WSFS Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of WSFS Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reasons of any reclassification, stock split (including reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, or there shall be any special or extraordinary dividend or distribution, then, the Merger Consideration (including the Exchange Ratio) shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect fully the effect of any such change and to give holders of Bryn Mawr Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be considered to permit any Party to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 


2.3.         Treatment of Bryn Mawr Equity Awards. 


(a)              At the Effective Time, each option granted by Bryn Mawr to purchase a share of Bryn Mawr Common Stock under a Bryn Mawr Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Bryn Mawr Stock Option”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and converted into the right to receive from WSFS a cash payment equal to the difference, if positive, between the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration and the exercise price of the Bryn Mawr Stock Option. Any Bryn Mawr Stock Option with an exercise price that equals or exceeds the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration shall be canceled with no consideration being paid to the optionholder with respect to such Bryn Mawr Stock Option. 


(b)             At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Bryn Mawr Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Bryn Mawr Stock Plan that is either outstanding or subject to a restricted stock unit or other Equity Right (other than a Bryn Mawr Stock Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Bryn Mawr Restricted Stock Award ”) shall fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition applicable to such Bryn Mawr Restricted Stock Award deemed to have been fully achieved (or achieved at the target level if more than one level of achievement has been contemplated)) and shall be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and treating the shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock subject to such Bryn Mawr Restricted Stock Award in the same manner as all other shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock for such purposes. WSFS shall pay or issue the consideration described in this Section 2.3(b) within ten days following the Effective Time. WSFS and the Affiliates of WSFS shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Bryn Mawr Restricted Stock Awards all such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law.

(c)              At or prior to the Effective Time, Bryn Mawr, the board of directors of Bryn Mawr or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3. 


2.4.         Fractional Shares. 


No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of WSFS Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of WSFS shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of WSFS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of WSFS Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment, rounded up to the nearest cent (without interest), which payment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of WSFS Common Stock that such holder of shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) by (ii) the Average Closing Price. 


ARTICLE 3 EXCHANGE OF SHARES 


3.1.         Exchange Procedures. 


(a)              Deposit of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, WSFS shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Bryn Mawr (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of record of shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock (excluding the Canceled Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Holders”), for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, (i) certificates or, at WSFS’s option, evidence of WSFS Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (collectively referred to as “WSFS Certificates”) for shares of WSFS Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) immediately available funds for any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4, to the extent then determinable (collectively, the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by WSFS, provided, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration and other amounts payable to the Holders. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to WSFS. WSFS shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement.

(b)             Delivery of Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than seven days following the Effective Time, WSFS shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share notice advising such Holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon (i) with respect to shares evidenced by Certificates, proper delivery of the Certificates and the transmittal materials, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, to the Exchange Agent (and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) and (ii) with respect to Book-Entry Shares, proper delivery of an “agent’s message” regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence (if any) of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with the appropriate transmittal materials, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the Holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the Merger Consideration in non-certificated book-entry form and (y) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares (which such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4) and any dividends or distributions which the Holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(d), in each case which such Holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE 3, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of Holders on the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 


(c)              Share Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of Bryn Mawr shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, Holders who held shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.1, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock (other than the Canceled Shares) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided in ARTICLE 2 in exchange therefor, subject, however, to WSFS’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been declared or made by Bryn Mawr in respect of such shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares (if any) pursuant to Section 2.4 and any dividends or distributions (if any) pursuant to Section 3.1(d) with respect to the shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock formerly represented thereby. 


(d)             Dividends with Respect to WSFS Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared (if any) with respect to WSFS Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the whole shares of WSFS Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Agreement until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of WSFS Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such whole shares of WSFS Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of WSFS Common Stock. 


(e)              Termination of Exchange Fund . Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which remains undistributed to the former Holders on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any former Holders who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any applicable dividends or other distributions with respect to WSFS Common Stock) to which they are entitled under this ARTICLE 3 shall thereafter look only to WSFS and the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

________________






(f)              No Liability. None of WSFS, Bryn Mawr, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any Holder in respect of any cash that would have otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares from the Exchange Fund delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 


(g)             Withholding Rights. Each and any of WSFS, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from cash in lieu of fractional shares of WSFS Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.1(d) or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, such amounts or property (or portions thereof) as WSFS, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or distribution under the Internal Revenue Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Regulatory Authority by WSFS, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by WSFS, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as applicable. 


(h)             Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividend or distributions to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. 


(i)               Change in Name on Certificate.

(a)              No Bryn Mawr Entity is the subject of any pending or, to the Knowledge of Bryn Mawr, threatened Litigation asserting that it or any other Bryn Mawr Entity has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act or comparable state Law) or other violation of state or federal labor Law or seeking to compel it or any other Bryn Mawr Entity to bargain with any labor organization or other employee representative as to wages or conditions of employment.

No Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan is required to be amended within the 90-day period beginning on the Closing Date in order to continue to comply with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and other applicable Law.

(f)              Each Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare plan has been amended and administered in accordance with the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.

No Tax under Internal Revenue Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan and no circumstance exists which could give rise to such Tax.

(i)               Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of any Bryn Mawr Entity, or result in any (i) requirement to fund any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi trust), (ii) limitation on the right of any Bryn Mawr Entity to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan or related trust, (iii) acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such payment, right, compensation or benefit, or (iv) entitlement by any recipient of any payment or benefit to receive a “gross up” payment for any income or other Taxes that might be owed with respect to such payment or benefit. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

No Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan provides for the gross up or reimbursement of Taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 or 409A, or otherwise.

Since December 31, 2017, neither WSFS nor WSFS Bank nor, to WSFS’s Knowledge, any employee, auditor, accountant or representative of any WSFS Entity has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the adequacy of such systems and processes or the accuracy or integrity of WSFS Financial Statements or the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to credit loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of any WSFS Entity or their respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that any WSFS Entity has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.

(d)             Records. The records, systems, controls, data and information of the WSFS Entities are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the WSFS Entities or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except where such non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on WSFS. WSFS (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, of the Exchange Act) to ensure the reliability of the WSFS Financial Statements and to ensure that information relating to the WSFS Entities is made known to the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or other members of executive management of WSFS by others within those entities as appropriate (A) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (B) which allow for maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Assets of WSFS, (C) that provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of WSFS are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of WSFS and (D) that provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of WSFS’s Assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to WSFS’s outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of WSFS (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect WSFS’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in WSFS’s internal controls over financial reporting. To the Knowledge of WSFS, there is no reason to believe that WSFS’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due, if required.

Each of WSFS and Bryn Mawr shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the WSFS Meeting and Bryn Mawr Meeting, as the case may be, two times pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.1(f).

7.2.         Acquisition Proposals. 


(a)             No Bryn Mawr Entity shall, and it shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage (including by providing information or assistance), facilitate or induce any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or cause to be furnished to any Person any confidential or nonpublic information or data in connection with, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any offer or proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a Person that has made or, to the Knowledge of Bryn Mawr, is making inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of this Section 7.2, (iii) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend, or propose to approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction, or (v) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, or facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 by any Subsidiary or Representative of Bryn Mawr shall constitute a breach of this Section 7.2 by Bryn Mawr. In addition to the foregoing, Bryn Mawr shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. 


(b)             Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.2(a), if Bryn Mawr or any of its Representatives receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any Person at any time prior to the Bryn Mawr Shareholder Approval that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of Section 7.2(a), Bryn Mawr and its Representatives may, prior to (but not after) the Bryn Mawr Meeting, take the following actions if the board of directors of Bryn Mawr (or any committee thereof) has (i) determined, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with Bryn Mawr’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such actions would reasonably likely cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with respect to such Person as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement is in each provision with respect to WSFS (and such confidentiality agreement shall not provide such Person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Bryn Mawr): (A) furnish information to (but only if Bryn Mawr shall have provided such information to WSFS prior to furnishing it to any such Person), and (B) enter into discussions and negotiations with, such Person with respect to such unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal. 


(c)             Promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, Bryn Mawr shall advise WSFS in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the name of the person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), and Bryn Mawr shall as promptly as practicable provide to WSFS (i) a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if in writing, or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if oral. Bryn Mawr shall provide WSFS as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours) with notice setting forth all such information as is necessary to keep WSFS informed on a current basis of all developments, discussions, negotiations and communications regarding (including amendments or proposed amendments to) such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. 


(d)             Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the Bryn Mawr Meeting, the board of directors of Bryn Mawr may make a Change in the Bryn Mawr Recommendation (including, for the avoidance of doubt, approving, endorsing or recommending any Acquisition Proposal), if (i) Bryn Mawr has received a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to the terms of any revised offer by WSFS pursuant to this Section 7.2(d)), and (ii) the board of directors of Bryn Mawr has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be a violation of the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the board of directors of Bryn Mawr may not take the actions set forth in this Section 7.2(d) unless:

(ii)               Bryn Mawr has provided WSFS at least five Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including all necessary information under Section 7.2(c)); 


(iii)              during such five Business Day period, Bryn Mawr has and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, consider and negotiate with WSFS in good faith (to the extent WSFS desires to so negotiate) regarding any proposals, adjustments or modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by WSFS; and 


(iv)              the board of directors of Bryn Mawr has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications proposed to by WSFS, if any, that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that failure to make a Change in the Bryn Mawr Recommendation would be a violation of the director’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, in which event, the board of directors of Bryn Mawr may communicate the basis for its lack of Bryn Mawr Recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by Law; provided, that the resolution approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended. 


Any material amendment to any Superior Proposal, will be deemed to be a new Superior Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.2(d) and will require a new determination and notice period as referred to in this Section 7.2(d). 


(e)             Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the WSFS Meeting, the board of directors of WSFS may make a Change in the WSFS Recommendation, if the board of directors of WSFS has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be a violation of the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the board of directors of WSFS may not take the actions set forth in this Section 7.2(e) unless: 


(i)                WSFS has provided Bryn Mawr at least five Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action; 


(ii)               during such five Business Day period, WSFS has and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, consider and negotiate with Bryn Mawr in good faith (to the extent Bryn Mawr desires to so negotiate) regarding any proposals, adjustments or modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Bryn Mawr; and 


(iii)              the board of directors of WSFS has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications proposed by Bryn Mawr, if any, that failure to make a Change in the WSFS Recommendation would be a violation of the director’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, in which event, the board of directors of WSFS may communicate the basis for its lack of WSFS Recommendation to its stockholders in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by Law; provided, that the resolution approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended.

(f)              Bryn Mawr and Bryn Mawr Subsidiaries shall, and Bryn Mawr shall direct its Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any offer or proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any Person (other than WSFS and its Representatives) that has made or indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) not waive or amend any “standstill” provision or provisions of similar effect to which it is a party or of which it is a beneficiary and shall strictly enforce any such provisions. 


(g)             Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Bryn Mawr or its board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to the stockholders of Bryn Mawr; provided, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 


7.3.         Exchange Listing. 


WSFS shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Time, on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of WSFS Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Bryn Mawr Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and WSFS shall give all notices and make all filings with Nasdaq required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. 


7.4.         Consents of Regulatory Authorities. 


(a)             WSFS and Bryn Mawr shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all applications, notices and filings and to obtain all Permits and Consents, of all third parties and Regulatory Authorities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Mergers), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such Permits and Consents of all such third parties and Regulatory Authorities. Each of WSFS and Bryn Mawr shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under any applicable Law or Order or by any Regulatory Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any WSFS Entities be required, and the Bryn Mawr Entities shall not be permitted (without WSFS’s prior written consent), to take any action, or commit to take any action, or to accept any restriction, commitment, or condition, involving the WSFS Entities or the Bryn Mawr Entities, which would be materially financially burdensome to the business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of WSFS and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (any such condition, commitment, or restriction, a “Burdensome Condition”). 


(b)             Each of WSFS and Bryn Mawr shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all written information submitted to any third party or Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, that Bryn Mawr shall not have the right to review portions of material filed by WSFS with a Regulatory Authority that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information or confidential supervisory information filed under a claim of confidentiality. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party agrees that it will consult with the other Party with respect to the obtaining of all Permits and Consents of third parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the other Party apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including advising the other Party upon receiving any communication from a Regulatory Authority the Consent of which is required for the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any required Consent from a Regulatory Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of such Consent may be materially delayed. Except for non-material routine communications between counsel and a Regulatory Authority relating to the regulatory approval process or status, each Party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Regulatory Authority, give the other Party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c)             Subject to Section 10.15, each Party agrees, upon request, subject to applicable Laws, to promptly furnish the other Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may reasonably be necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party and/or Regulatory Authority. 


7.5.         Access to Information; Confidentiality and Notification of Certain Matters. 


(a)             Bryn Mawr and WSFS shall each promptly advise the other of any fact, change, event or circumstance (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would reasonably be likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE 8; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 7.5(a) or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2 or 8.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 or 8.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.5(b) shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to WSFS or Bryn Mawr. 


(b)            Prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws and Section 10.15, each of Bryn Mawr and WSFS shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the Representatives of the other Party, access during normal business hours to its books, records, Contracts, properties and personnel and such other information as the other Party may reasonably request and furnish to the other Party promptly all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other Party may reasonably request, provided, that such access or requests shall not unreasonably interfere with normal operations of the Party. No investigation by either Party or their respective Representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to such Party’s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Bryn Mawr nor WSFS nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Bryn Mawr’s or WSFS’s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or to the extent that Bryn Mawr or WSFS, as the case may be, impose any reasonable restrictions with respect to in-person access in light of the Pandemic or the Pandemic Measures, including the health and safety of such party’s employees. The Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

7.6.         Press Releases. 


Bryn Mawr and WSFS shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or other public disclosure or communication (including communications to employees, agents and contractors) related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue such press release or other public disclosure without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any press release or other public disclosure as may, upon the advice of outside counsel, be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or non-United States securities exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or disclosure shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or disclosure in advance of the issuance thereof. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement. 


7.7.        Tax Treatment. 


(a)             Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the Bank Merger, and to take no action which would cause the Merger and the Bank Merger not, to each qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue Code. 


(b)             Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their appropriate officers to execute and deliver to Covington & Burling LLP and to Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP, certificates containing appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to each such counsel, at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by each such counsel, including as of the effective date of the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and the Closing Date, in connection with such counsels’ deliveries of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the Merger and the Bank Merger. 


(c)              Unless otherwise required pursuant to a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of WSFS and Bryn Mawr shall report the Merger and the Bank Merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take any inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.

7.8.         Employee Benefits and Contracts. 


(a)             For a period of one year following the Effective Time, except as contemplated by this Agreement, WSFS shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to employees who are actively employed by a Bryn Mawr Entity at the Effective Time (“Covered Employees”) while employed by WSFS following the Closing Date employee benefits under WSFS Benefit Plans, on terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided by WSFS Entities to their similarly situated employees; provided, that in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of any WSFS Entity. Until such time as WSFS shall cause the Covered Employees to participate in the applicable WSFS Benefit Plans, the continued participation of the Covered Employees in the Bryn Mawr Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this clause (it being understood that participation in WSFS Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each of WSFS Benefit Plans). For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting under WSFS Benefit Plans, and for purposes of determining a Covered Employee’s entitlement to paid time off under WSFS’s paid time off program, the service of the Covered Employees with a Bryn Mawr Entity prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with a WSFS Entity participating in such WSFS Benefit Plans, to the same extent that such service was recognized by the Bryn Mawr Entities for purposes of a similar benefit plan; provided, that such recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly-situated employees of WSFS Entities do not receive credit for prior service, (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation, or (z) for purposes of retiree medical benefits or level of benefits under a defined benefit pension plan. 


(b)             From and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of Section 7.8(a), with respect to each Covered Employee (and their beneficiaries) WSFS shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each life, disability, medical, dental or health plan of WSFS or its Subsidiaries in which each such Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate (to the extent permitted by the applicable carrier) to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the applicable life, disability, medical, dental or health plans of the Bryn Mawr Entities, (ii) provide credit under medical, dental and health plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Covered Employees (and their beneficiaries) under analogous plans of the Bryn Mawr Entities prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation, actively-at-work requirement or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Covered Employees and their beneficiaries on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or beneficiary had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time. 


(c)             Bryn Mawr shall, effective no later than 90 days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, take all necessary and appropriate actions, including any plan amendment, loan policy amendment and communications to participants, to provide that no further participant loans may be taken from any Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan that is defined contribution plan with a 401(k) feature (the “Bryn Mawr 401(k) Plan”). The form and substance of the amendments, documents and notices effecting such action shall be subject to the prior review and written approval of WSFS (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Bryn Mawr shall deliver to WSFS an executed or final copy of such amendments, documents and notices and shall fully comply with such amendments, documents and notices. Bryn Mawr shall, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the “401(k) Plan Termination Date”) and contingent upon the Closing, adopt such necessary resolutions and/or amendments to the Bryn Mawr 401(k) Plan to terminate the Bryn Mawr 401(k) Plan as of the 401(k) Plan Termination Date. The form and substance of such resolutions and any necessary amendments shall be subject to the prior review and written approval of WSFS (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Bryn Mawr shall deliver to WSFS an executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as practicable following their adoption by the board of directors of Bryn Mawr and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments.

(d)             Upon request by WSFS in writing prior to the Closing Date, the Bryn Mawr Entities shall cooperate in good faith with WSFS prior to the Closing Date to amend, freeze, terminate or modify any other Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan to the extent and in the manner determined by WSFS effective upon the Closing Date (or at such different time mutually agreed to by the Parties) and consistent with applicable Law. Bryn Mawr shall provide WSFS with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 7.8(d), as applicable, and give WSFS a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be considered in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date, Bryn Mawr shall provide WSFS with the final documentation evidencing that the actions contemplated herein have been effectuated. 


(e)             Without limiting the generality of Section 10.4, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Bryn Mawr or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement: (i) establish, amend, or modify any Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan or any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by WSFS, Bryn Mawr or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Surviving Corporation, WSFS or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Bryn Mawr Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date, or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Bryn Mawr or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any right to employment or continued employment or continued service with WSFS or any WSFS Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or the Bryn Mawr Entities, or constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee, or interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Bryn Mawr, WSFS or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Bryn Mawr or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. 


(f)              On the Closing Date, Bryn Mawr shall provide WSFS with a list of employees who have suffered an “employment loss” (as defined in the WARN Act) in the 90 days preceding the Closing Date or had a reduction in hours of a least 50% in the 180 days preceding the Closing Date, each identified by date of employment loss or reduction in hours, employing entity and facility location. 


(g)             To the extent any payments or benefits made with respect to, or which could arise as a result of, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, could be characterized as an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, Bryn Mawr shall, prior to the Closing Date, cooperate in good faith with WSFS to effect reasonable measures to minimize any such payments or benefits from being characterized as “excess parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. 


(h)             The parties shall perform the actions set forth on Section 7.8 of each of Bryn Mawr’s and WSFS’s Disclosure Memorandum. 


7.9.        Indemnification. 


(a)             From and after the Effective Time, each of WSFS and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted, the present and former directors or officers of the Bryn Mawr Entities, and any present and former employee or agent of the Bryn Mawr Entities entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under Bryn Mawr’s organizational documents or any agreements providing for indemnification by the Bryn Mawr Entities in place on the date hereof (each, an “Indemnified Party”), against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Bryn Mawr Entities or, at Bryn Mawr’s request, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a “Claim”), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under Bryn Mawr’s organizational documents in place on the date hereof and applicable Law (and WSFS or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides a written undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification). 


54








________________






(b)             WSFS shall cause to be maintained in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time Bryn Mawr’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (provided, that WSFS may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous to the insured or (ii) with the consent of Bryn Mawr given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, that WSFS shall not be obligated to make aggregate premium payments for such six-year period in respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion related to Bryn Mawr’s directors and officers, 250% of the aggregate annual premium payments currently paid on Bryn Mawr’s current policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the “Maximum Amount”). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, WSFS shall cause to be maintained policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that, in the Surviving Corporation’s good faith determination, provide the most advantageous coverage obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, WSFS, or Bryn Mawr in consultation with WSFS, may obtain on or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year “tail” prepaid policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in this Section 7.9(b) at a premium not to exceed the Maximum Amount.

(c)             Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 7.9(a), upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify WSFS thereof (but the failure to so notify WSFS shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7.9, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices WSFS). In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) WSFS or Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and, upon such assumption, WSFS and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof (except that if WSFS elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Party reasonably advises the Indemnified Party that there are or may be (whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues that raise conflicts of interest between WSFS and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to WSFS, and WSFS shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) WSFS and Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and provided, further, that WSFS and Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

7.14.       Change of Method. 


WSFS may at any time change the method of effecting the combination of the Bryn Mawr and WSFS (including by providing for the merger of Bryn Mawr with a wholly owned Subsidiary of WSFS) if and to the extent requested by WSFS, and Bryn Mawr agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as WSFS may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers with respect to Bryn Mawr’s shareholders, or (iii) materially delay or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Each such Bryn Mawr Director shall be appointed to a class of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Bank, as applicable, as mutually agreed by Bryn Mawr and WSFS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, WSFS’s and WSFS Bank’s, as applicable, obligation to appoint a particular Bryn Mawr Director is subject to each such Bryn Mawr Director’s compliance with WSFS’s and WSFS Bank’s, as applicable, governance and ethics policies, including customary interview and onboarding practices of WSFS and WSFS Bank, as applicable, in place from time to time, as reasonably determined by WSFS’s and WSFS Bank’s, as applicable, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.

If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of WSFS and Bryn Mawr will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute. 


7.18.       Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). 


Bryn Mawr and WSFS agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of Bryn Mawr subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the “Bryn Mawr Insiders”), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Bryn Mawr Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares of Bryn Mawr Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this Section 7.18.

Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term the singular. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed followed by the words “without limitation.” The word “or” shall not be exclusive and “any” means “any and all.” The words “hereby,” “herein,” “hereof,” “hereunder” and similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific Section. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the context may require. If a word or phrase is defined, the other grammatical forms of such word or phrase have a corresponding meaning. A reference to a document, agreement or instrument also refers to all addenda, exhibits or schedules thereto. A reference to any “copy” or “copies” of a document, agreement or instrument means a copy or copies that are complete and correct. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all accounting terms used in this Agreement will be interpreted, and all accounting determinations under this Agreement will be made, in accordance with GAAP. Any capitalized terms used in any schedule, Exhibit or Disclosure Memorandum but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning set forth in this Agreement. All references to “dollars” or “$” in this Agreement are to United States dollars. All references to “the transactions contemplated by this Agreement” (or similar phrases) include the transactions provided for in this Agreement, including the Mergers. Any Contract or Law defined or referred to herein or in any Contract that is referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts) by waiver or consent and (in the case of Law) by succession of comparable successor Law and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. The term “made available” means any document or other information that was (a) provided (whether by physical or electronic delivery) by one Party or its representatives to the other Party or its representatives at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof, (b) included in the virtual data room (on a continuation basis without subsequent modification) of a Party at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof, or (c) filed by a Party with the SEC and publicly available on EDGAR at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof.

10.3.        Expenses. 


(a)            Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.3, each of the Parties shall bear and pay all direct costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including filing, registration and application fees, printing and mailing fees, and fees and expenses of its own financial or other consultants, investment bankers, accountants, and counsel, except that each of the Parties shall bear and pay one-half of the filing fees payable in connection with the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and printing costs incurred in connection with the printing of the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus. 


(b)            Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a), 


(i)               if either Bryn Mawr or WSFS terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(ii) or 9.1(c) (and the Bryn Mawr Shareholder Approval has not been obtained) or WSFS terminates pursuant to Section 9.1(f), and prior to such termination, any Person has made an Acquisition Proposal or has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal, and within 12 months of such termination Bryn Mawr shall either (A) consummate an Acquisition Transaction or (B) enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction, whether or not such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated and, in each case, whether or not relating to the same Acquisition Proposal that had been made or publicly announced prior to such termination; or 


(ii)               if WSFS shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d), then Bryn Mawr shall pay to WSFS an amount equal to $37,725,000 (the “Termination Fee”). If the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to subsection (i) of this Section 10.3(b), the Termination Fee shall be paid in same-day funds at or prior to the earlier of the date of consummation of such Acquisition Transaction or the date of execution of an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Transaction. If the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to subsection (ii) of this Section 10.3(b), the Termination Fee shall be paid in same-day funds within two Business Days from the date of termination of this Agreement. 


(c)            The payment of the Termination Fee by Bryn Mawr pursuant to Section 10.3(b) constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty, and shall be the sole monetary remedy of WSFS in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(ii), 9.1(c), 9.1(d), or 9.1(f). The Parties acknowledge that the agreement contained in Section 10.3(b) is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that without such agreement, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Bryn Mawr fails to pay any fee payable by it pursuant to this Section 10.3 when due, then Bryn Mawr shall pay to WSFS its costs and expenses incurred (including attorneys’ fees) in connection with collecting such fee, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the “prime rate” (as announced by Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made, for the period commencing on the date such payment was due under this Agreement until the date of payment. 


10.4.       Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. 


Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement (including Bryn Mawr’s Disclosure Memorandum and WSFS’s Disclosure Memorandum, the Exhibits, the schedules, and the other documents and instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Subsidiary Plan of Merger and the Voting Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereto, written or oral. Nothing in this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the Parties or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, other than as specifically provided in Section 7.9. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, no Consent of any third party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement.

10.5.       Amendments. 


To the extent permitted by Law, this Agreement may be amended by a subsequent writing signed by each of the Parties upon the approval of each of the Parties, whether before or after the Bryn Mawr Shareholder Approval or WSFS Stockholder Approval has been obtained; provided, that after obtaining the Bryn Mawr Shareholder Approval or WSFS Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that requires further approval by such stockholders. 


10.6.       Waivers. 


At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent permitted by Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; provided, that after the Bryn Mawr Shareholder Approval or WSFS Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further stockholder approval under applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition. 


10.7.       Assignment. 


Except as expressly contemplated hereby, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise by operation of Law) without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 


10.8.       Notices. 


All notices or other communications which are required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered by hand, by facsimile transmission (followed by overnight courier), by registered or certified mail, postage pre-paid, or by courier or overnight carrier, or by email (with receipt confirmed) to the persons at the addresses set forth below (or at such other address as may be provided hereunder), and shall be deemed to have been delivered as of the date so delivered:

(a)             The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any conflict of Laws or choice of Law principles that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive Law of another jurisdiction (except that matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Bryn Mawr shall be subject to the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that matters relating to the Bank Merger shall be subject to the Laws of the United States to the extent they are mandatorily applicable).

10.10.    Counterparts; Signatures. 


This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment or waiver hereto or any agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

10.13.    Enforcement of Agreement. 


The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the Parties’ obligation to consummate the Merger) in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

10.14.    Severability. 


Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.

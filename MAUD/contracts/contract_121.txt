(g)            No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration, as applicable, if the Exchange Fund has been delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under applicable Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   Section 3.4     Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is

Agreement, if any, including any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Parent SEC Documents”). As of their respective dates, the Parent SEC Documents (other than preliminary materials) complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents, at the time of filing or being furnished (or effectiveness in the case of registration statements), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or superseded by later Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement. Parent does not have any outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to any Parent SEC Documents. Other than Parent OP, no Parent Subsidiary is required to file any form or report with the SEC.   (b)          Parent has made available to Company complete and correct copies of all written correspondence between the SEC on one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, since January 1, 2019.

  or superseded by later Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement.   (d)          Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any Parent Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any “off balance sheet arrangements” (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or such Parent’s or Parent Subsidiary’s audited financial statements or other Parent SEC Documents.   (e)          Since January 1, 2019, Parent maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d- 15(f), as applicable, under the Exchange Act) that is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parent’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. There has been no change in Parent’s internal control over financial reporting that has occurred since December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Parent’s internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2020, there have been no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in Parent’s internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated).

58   


  changes, effects, developments, conditions or occurrences, would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.9           No Undisclosed Material Liabilities.

Section 5.11         Litigation. Except as individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as of the date of this Agreement, (a) there is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing by or before any Governmental Authority, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, is there any investigation pending by any Governmental Authority, in each case, against or affecting Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any director or officer of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, in their capacity as a director or an officer of Parent or such Parent Subsidiary, and (b) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary, nor any of their respective properties, is subject to any outstanding Order of any Governmental Authority.   Section 5.12         Taxes.   (a)          Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has timely filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority all income and other material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking into account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material respects. Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been paid on its behalf), or made adequate provisions in accordance with GAAP for, all material Taxes required to be paid by it, whether or not shown on any Tax Return.   (b)          Parent (i) for all taxable years commencing with Parent’s taxable year ending December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2020, has been subject to taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2021 to the date hereof, in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT (including with regard to the REIT distribution requirements) for its taxable year that ends on the   


59   


  day of the Merger; and (iv) has not taken or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in Parent’s failure to qualify as a REIT or in a challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority to its status as a REIT, and, no such challenge is pending or threatened to the Knowledge of Parent. Parent’s dividends paid deduction, within the meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for each taxable year commencing with and including the taxable year ended December 31, 2013, taking into account any dividends subject to Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the sum of (x) Parent’s REIT taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined without regard to any dividends paid deduction for such year and (y) Parent’s net capital gain for such year.   (c)          (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened with regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary; (ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled except for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any material Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year; (iv) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return; and (v) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has entered into any “closing agreement” as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law).   (d)          Each Parent Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has been since its formation treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a partnership, disregarded entity, or Qualified REIT Subsidiary, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation whose separate existence is respected for federal income tax purposes. No Parent Subsidiary is a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation other than a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation that qualifies as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary.   (e)          Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section 1374 of the Code (or otherwise result in any “built-in gains” Tax under Section 337(d) of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder).   (f)           For each taxable year commencing with and including the taxable year ended December 31, 2013, Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have not incurred (i) any material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 857(f), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code and (ii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with acquisitions or dispositions of property. To the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed upon Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  (g)          Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary (other than a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of Parent) has engaged at any time in any “prohibited transactions” within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction that would give rise to “redetermined rents,” “redetermined deductions,” “excess interest” or “redetermined TRS service income,” in each case as defined in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code.   (h)          Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have complied, in all material respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 1471 through 1474 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority all material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable Laws, and are not liable for any arrears or wages or any taxes or any penalty for failure to withhold or pay such amounts.   (i)           There are no Parent Tax Protection Agreements (as hereinafter defined) in force at the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no person has raised in writing, or to the Knowledge of Parent threatened to raise, a material claim against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for any breach of any Parent Tax Protection Agreements.

(j)           There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.   (k)          There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (other than customary arrangements under commercial contracts or borrowings entered into in the ordinary course of business), and after the Closing Date, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall be bound by any such Tax allocation agreements or similar arrangements or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

(n)            Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has participated in any “listed transaction” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).   (o)           As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not aware of any fact or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (p)           Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has constituted either a “distributing corporation” or a “controlled corporation” (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a “plan” or “series of related transactions” (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (q)           No written power of attorney that has been granted by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (other than to Parent or a Parent Subsidiary) currently is in force with respect to any matter relating to Taxes, except for powers of attorney granted to counsel with respect to appeals of real estate tax assessments.   (r)            Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary (other than any Parent Subsidiary that is a taxable REIT subsidiary) has or has had any earnings and profits attributable to such entity or any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code.

Parent has provided or made available to Company a copy of the material plan documents governing each such Parent Benefit Plan.

Company agrees that in the event any Representative of Company or any Company Subsidiary takes any action which, if taken by Company, would constitute a material violation of this Section 7.3(a), then Company shall be deemed to be in violation of this Section 7.3(a) for all purposes of this Agreement.

(d)            If the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6.   (e)            The Surviving Entity shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.6; provided, that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law.

Company shall not be deemed to have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entered into or agreed to enter a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement as a result of providing any cooperation or taking any actions to the extent requested by Parent in connection with a Parent-Approved Transaction. The consummation of any Parent-Approved Transaction shall not constitute consummation of a Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Section 9.3(b)(i)(C), nor shall any Company Acquisition Proposal made in respect of a Parent-Approved Transaction constitute a Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of Section 9.3(b)(i)(C). Parent shall, promptly upon request by Company, reimburse Company for all reasonable, documented and invoiced out-of-pocket costs actually incurred by Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with performing their obligations under this Section 7.17.

  Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) with respect to the 2022 calendar year, if applicable, target annual cash bonus opportunity at least equal to the target annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (which opportunity shall exclude, for the avoidance of doubt, any target annual bonus settled in equity or equity-based incentive arrangements), and (iii) retirement and health and welfare benefits that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those retirement and health and welfare benefits that are either, at Parent’s discretion, (A) provided to such Continuing Employee by Company or any Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent or Parent Subsidiaries, in each case, excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified retirement, severance, post-retirement medical or welfare, equity or equity-based incentive, retention, change in control or similar plans, agreements, programs, policies, practices or other arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to employ any Person, nor shall it alter the at-will employment status of any Company Employee.   (b)           Solely to the extent Parent Benefit Plans (exclusive of Company and Company Subsidiaries) provide benefits to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out- of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee’s employment with Company and Company Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, and solely for severance or vacation accrual, benefit accrual under each applicable Parent Benefit Plan, as if such service had been performed with Parent, except for any plan maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary under which similarly-situated employees of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation, or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or retroactive application.   (c)            Unless otherwise requested by Parent not less than five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date, Company shall adopt board resolutions and take any corporate action as is necessary to terminate each Company Benefit Plan that is a Tax-qualified defined contribution plan with a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (the “Company Qualified DC Plan”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date but contingent on the occurrence of the Closing. The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the reasonable prior review and approval of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Upon the distribution of the assets in the accounts under the Company Qualified DC Plan to the participants, Parent shall permit such participants who are then actively employed by Parent or Parent Subsidiaries to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash, from the Company Qualified DC Plan to the applicable Tax-qualified defined contribution plans of Parent or Parent Subsidiaries.   (d)           Prior to the Effective Time, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall communicate with Continuing Employees regarding post-Effective Time employment

(e)            Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby constitutes a “change of control”, a “change in control” or a “sale event” (or a term of similar import) for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan set forth on Section 7.19(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter that contains a definition of “change of control”, a “change in control” or a “sale event” (or a term of similar import), as applicable.   (f)            Annual cash incentive bonuses for calendar year 2021 shall be treated as set forth in Section 7.19(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (g)           Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and the Parent OP to honor in accordance with their terms all severance and separation pay plans, agreements and arrangements, and all written employment, severance, retention, incentive, change in control and termination agreements (including any change in control provisions therein) applicable to employees of Company and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as set forth in Section 7.19(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (h)           The provisions of this Section 7.19 are solely for the benefit of the Parties. No current or former director, employee or other individual service provider or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan or any other Benefit Plan for any purpose. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing in this Section 7.19, nothing contained in this Agreement shall otherwise obligate Parent, Company or any of their respective Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular Benefit Plan or (ii) retain the employment or services of any current or former director, trustee, employee or other individual service provider.   Section 7.20           Company Equity Awards.   (a)            Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents (including consent of holders of Company RSUs), make any amendments to the Company Equity Incentive Plans or Company Equity Awards, and take all such other actions that may be necessary (under the Company Equity Incentive Plans, applicable Laws and otherwise) (i) to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.1(c) and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Equity Awards shall have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in Section 3.1(c) and (ii) to terminate the Company Director Plan, effective as of the Effective Time.   (b)           At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all obligations in respect of each Company Equity Incentive Plan (other than the Company Director Plan). Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued Parent Common Shares for issuance of and/or for delivery upon settlement of Company Equity Awards assumed and converted into rights with respect to Parent Common Shares in accordance with

Each Party irrevocably agrees (a) to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and forum of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, to the United Stated District Court for the State of Maryland, Northern Division (the “Maryland Courts”) for the purpose of any Action (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement, (b) to request and/or consent to the assignment of any dispute arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement to the Business and Technology Case Management Program of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), (c) that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction or forum by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (d) that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement in any court other than the Maryland Courts, and (e) that a final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the Parties agrees, that service of process may be made within or outside the State of Maryland, and agree that service of process on such Party at the address referred to in Section 10.2 (or such other address as may be specified in accordance with Section 10.2) by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service shall be deemed effective service of process. Service made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within the State of Maryland.

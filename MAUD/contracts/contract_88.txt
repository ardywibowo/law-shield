NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereunder, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:  





ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section 1.1           Closing. The Parties shall consummate the Merger (the “Closing”) electronically (including by email) by the exchange of required closing deliveries at 8:00 a.m. on the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions in Article VI (except for any condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of any such condition), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. As used herein, “Closing Date” means the date on which the Closing occurs.   Section 1.2           The Merger.   (a)          Surviving Corporation. On the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”).

(b)          Effective Time. At the Closing, the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger for the Merger (the “Certificate of Merger”), duly executed in accordance with, and in such form as required by, the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Company duly files the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective, the “Effective Time”).   (c)          Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided herein and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the Liabilities of the Company and Merger Sub.   (d)          Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be the same as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be “Magellan Health, Inc.” and (ii) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be “Magellan Health, Inc.”   (e)          Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective Time, (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II   EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 2.1          Effect on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger Sub.   (a)          At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by any Party or any other Person (including the Company Stockholders):   (i)            all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned of record or Beneficially Owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (including as treasury stock or otherwise), and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;   (ii)           each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled under Section 2.1(a)(i), Appraisal Shares, Company RSAs and Company Director RSAs) (each, a “Converted Share”) shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive $95.00 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”); and   (iii)          each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)          As of the Effective Time, each holder of (i) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any share of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) or (ii) any share of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (each, a “Book-Entry Share”) shall cease to have any rights related thereto, except, with respect to Converted Shares, the right to receive the Merger Consideration (subject to Section 2.3 and compliance with Section 2.4), and, with respect to Company RSAs and Company Director RSAs, as provided in Section 2.6(c) and Section 2.6(d), respectively.   Section 2.2           Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, from and after the date hereof until the earlier of (a) the Effective Time and (b) any termination hereof under Article VII, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Equity Awards) the same economic effect as contemplated by Section 2.1 and Section 2.6 prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision hereof.   

3





Section 2.3           Appraisal Shares. As used herein, “Appraisal Share” means any share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such share of Company Common Stock in accordance, and who complies in all respects, with Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”). At the Effective Time, (a) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or any other Person (including the Company Stockholders), each Appraisal Share shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and (b) each holder of an Appraisal Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Share under Section 262; provided, however, that, if any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 for such Appraisal Share, (i) the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Appraisal Share shall cease, such Appraisal Share shall cease to be an Appraisal Share and shall be referred to herein as a “Subsequently Converted Share” and (ii) such Subsequently Converted Share shall be deemed to be a Converted Share. The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served under Section 262. Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct and control all negotiations and Actions related to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment related to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal under the DGCL or agree to do any of the foregoing.   Section 2.4          Exchange of Company Common Stock.   (a)          Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary paying agent agreement with Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. or another financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”).   (b)          (i) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of cash necessary to pay the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration under Section 2.1(a)(ii) (the “Payment Fund”). If any Appraisal Share becomes a Subsequently Converted Share, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for addition to the Payment Fund, the aggregate amount of cash into which such Subsequently Converted Shares were converted into a right to receive under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and Section 2.3. The Parties intend that the Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to the holders of Converted Shares and Subsequently Converted Shares out of the Payment Fund under the paying agent agreement contemplated by Section 2.4(a). Except as provided in Section 2.4(h), the Parties intend that the Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(c)          Exchange Procedures.   (i)           Certificates. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event more than four (4) Business Days) after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a Certificate representing Converted Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof under Section 2.4(g)) and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Prior to such mailing, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the form of such letter of transmittal and such instructions. Upon surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof under Section 2.4(g)), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate, and such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name such Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax was paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate hereunder.   (ii)           Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any holder of a Book-Entry Share that is a Converted Share shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares that are Converted Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, multiplied by the number of Converted Shares previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.   (d)          The Merger Consideration issued and paid under this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates that represent Converted Shares (or, automatically, in the case of the Book-Entry Shares that are Converted Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   

5





(e)          Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Merger Consideration provided to the Paying Agent under Section 2.4(b) to pay for any Subsequently Converted Share shall be delivered to Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) of Parent’s demand to the Paying Agent therefor; provided that, in such case, until twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be delivered for such Subsequently Converted Share.   (f)          None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any cash from the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (g)         In the event any Certificate representing Converted Shares has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation related to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as provided in this Article II.   (h)          The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment income or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments (net of any losses) shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Article II. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.   

6





(i)           Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person under this Agreement such amounts as required to be deducted and withheld from such payment under applicable Law related to Taxes and Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period required by applicable Law. Any amount deducted or withheld under this Section 2.4(i) and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated as having been paid to the Person for which such deduction or withholding was made. Other than with respect to any consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.6, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Company (or other applicable Person) advance notice of any anticipated deduction or withholding and to cooperate with the Company to reduce or eliminate any amounts that would otherwise be deducted or withheld.   Section 2.5           Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation determines that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any right, property or asset of either of the Company or (if applicable) Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the agents of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such actions as any such agents deems necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes hereof.   Section 2.6           Company Equity Awards; Company ESPP.   (a)         Company Options. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a stock option (each, an “Adjusted Option”) with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the LTI Retirement Policy) and relating to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to any such Adjusted Option will be an amount equal to the quotient of (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (2) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional cents rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to any such Adjusted Option and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to any such Adjusted Option will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company Stock Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. 

7

Any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents in connection with any Company PSU will be assumed and become an obligation in connection with the applicable Adjusted PSU.   (c)          Company RSAs. As of the Effective Time, each Company RSA that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a restricted share (each, an “Adjusted RSA”) with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time (including double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the LTI Retirement Policy) and relating to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share.   (d)          Company Director RSAs. As of the Effective Time, each Company Director RSA that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 2.6(d) shall be paid to the holders of such Company Director RSAs as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.   (e)          Company RSUs.

Any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents in connection with any Company RSU will be assumed and become an obligation in connection with the applicable Adjusted RSU.   

8





(f)          Company PCUs. As of the Effective Time, each Company PCU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a phantom cash unit (each, an “Adjusted PCU”) with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company PCU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including double-trigger vesting and all other provisions set forth under the applicable award agreements and the LTI Retirement Policy) and relating to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company PCU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share.   (g)          Company ESPP. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take all actions as may be reasonably required to provide that (i) the Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of the date hereof shall be the final Offering Period (such period, the “Final Offering Period”) and no further Offering Period shall commence pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date hereof, and (ii) each individual participating in the Final Offering Period on the date hereof shall not be permitted to (1) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the Company ESPP from the rate in effect when the Final Offering Period commenced or (2) make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date hereof.

________________


SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified and agreed by Parent and the Company, which date shall be no later than the third Business Day following the satisfaction (or waiver by the party entitled thereto) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by the party entitled thereto) of such conditions), remotely via the electronic exchange of documents and signature pages, unless another time or date shall be agreed in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date”. 


SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as the “Effective Time”). 


SECTION 1.04. Effects of Merger. The Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable provisions, including Section 259, of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

________________


(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. 


ARTICLE II 


Effect on Capital Stock; Payment for Shares 


SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Cancellation of Stock Owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (such shares, “Excluded Shares”), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $47.50, without interest and less any applicable withholding Taxes (the “Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02. (d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”) (such shares, “Appraisal Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of   3








________________


competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to receive those rights under and to be paid such consideration as is determined pursuant to Section 262, shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). If the Surviving Corporation makes any payment after the Effective Time with respect to Appraisal Shares to the holders thereof pursuant to such holders’ appraisal rights under Section 262, then any portion of the Merger Consideration relating to such Appraisal Shares held in the Exchange Fund shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of any such demands or any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to the rights of appraisal of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demand that is not conditioned on consummation of the Merger. 


SECTION 2.02. Payment of Merger Consideration. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). (b) Exchange Procedure. Promptly (and in any event no later than three Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates, or a non-certificated share or non-certificated shares, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates” or “Book-Entry Shares”, respectively) which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (A) in the case of a Certificate, surrender of such Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent or (B) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other   4








________________


evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with the provisions of this Article II. (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock that such Certificate or Book-Entry Share represented immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. No cash payment with respect to the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate Book-Entry Share until the surrender of such Certificate Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Section 2.02. (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. (e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered for Merger Consideration prior to the four (4) year anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   5

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No such investment or any loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II. Parent shall take actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash in an amount sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. (g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, or, if the undistributed portion of the Exchange Fund has been returned to Parent pursuant to Section 2.02(d), by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration.

Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Vested Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) any amount of the option bonus payment that the holder of such Company Stock Option is entitled to receive with respect to such Company Stock Option in connection with the Company’s May 2019 dividend recapitalization transaction that remains unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a non-employee member of the Company Board (whether vested or unvested) (a “Director RSU”) shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be canceled, with the holder of such Director RSU becoming entitled to receive with respect thereto solely an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Director RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iii) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any vesting that would occur as a result of the occurrence of the Merger (a “Company Unvested Stock Option”), shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be canceled and converted into a stock option award (a “Converted Stock Option Award”) with substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as were applicable to such Company Unvested Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) with respect to a number of shares of Parent common stock that is equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (x) the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Unvested Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) with an exercise price per share that is equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest cent) of (x) the exercise price per share of such Company Unvested Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price in this clause (B), the “Converted Exercise Price”). With respect to any fractional share of Parent common stock that would otherwise be included in a Converted Stock Option Award but for the rounding down to the nearest share of Parent common stock as described in the immediately foregoing sentence, the holder of the applicable Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest cent) of (I) the amount of such fractional share of Parent common stock and (II) the excess of (X) the Parent Stock Price over (Y) the Converted Exercise Price.

For purposes hereof, “Retirement” shall mean the termination of a holder’s employment or services (other than for Cause or due to the holder’s death or Disability) following the date on which (1) the holder attains the age of 55 years old and the number of completed years of the holder’s employment or services with the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates (and their respective predecessors) is at least 10 or (2) the holder attains the age of 60 years old and the number of completed years of the holder’s employment or services with the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates (and their respective predecessors) is at least five.

All amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.03(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and may be paid through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or, in the case of non-employee directors, such other method as the Company typically uses for payments to such Persons. (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that the Company shall not be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to, upon exercise of, or in settlement of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs, as applicable, after the Effective Time. Parent shall (i) assume all of the Company Stock Plans, including (A) all of the obligations of the Company with respect to the Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs, and (B) any remaining reserve of shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans (as adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio), and (ii) take all corporate actions as may be necessary for the treatment of Company equity awards as described in this Section 2.03. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall file one or more appropriate registration statements (on Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to shares of Parent common stock underlying the awards converted pursuant to this Section 2.03, and Parent shall maintain the effectiveness of each such registration statement for so long as the Converted Stock Option Awards, Converted RSU Awards, and Converted PSU Awards remain outstanding.   9

The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies (the “Bankruptcy and Equity Exception”)).

Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (B) the Company receives a Company Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.02 and for which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) solely in the case of clause (i)(B), enter into a definitive written agreement providing for the consummation of a Superior Proposal and concurrently terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); provided, however, that the Company Board and any committee thereof shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any action set forth in clause (i) or clause (ii) above unless, prior to taking such action (A) the Company has provided written notice to Parent (a “Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change”) advising Parent that the Company Board or any such committee intends to take such action and the reasons therefor, (B) in the case of any Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change provided in connection with an Intervening Event, such Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change contains a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event, (C) in the case of any Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change provided in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, such Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change specifies the material terms and conditions of the related Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal and includes a copy of the relevant agreement or proposal with respect to such Superior Proposal, (D) a period of four Business Days has elapsed following Parent’s receipt of such Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood that any amendment or modification to any Company Takeover Proposal that is the basis for such proposed Adverse Recommendation Change shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and an additional notice period (which shall be the longer of (x) three Business Days and (y) the period remaining under the initial notice period)), (E) if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and its Representatives during such four Business Day period (as it may be extended pursuant to clause (D)) to enable Parent to propose in writing in a binding offer to effect changes to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (F) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in any binding proposal, the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) (1) with respect to the actions described in clause (i) of this Section 5.02(f), that it would continue to be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to effect the Adverse Recommendation Change and (2) with respect to the actions described in clause (i)(B) and clause (ii) of this Section 5.02(f), that the Company Takeover Proposal received by the Company continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes offered by Parent in such binding proposal were given effect; provided, further, that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(f) shall be void and of no force and effect unless such termination is in accordance with Section 8.01(f) and the Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 6.06 prior to or concurrently with such termination.  48

Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information with respect to it or provided by it for use in the Information Statement if and to the extent, in the absence of such a correction, the Information Statement would contain a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Company shall disseminate such correction to the stockholders of the Company in an amendment or supplement mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC and of any request (whether written or oral) by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Information Statement and shall promptly supply Parent with copies of all such comments, requests and any other written correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Information Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC concerning the Information Statement and to resolve such comments with the SEC and cause the Information Statement to be filed with the SEC in definitive form as contemplated by Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Information Statement to be disseminated to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after, and in any event within two days after, the latest of (i) confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments on the Information Statement, (ii) confirmation from the SEC that the Information Statement is otherwise not to be reviewed or (iii) expiration of the 10-day period after filing in the event the SEC does not review the Information Statement.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01(b) shall not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other Person of any Company Takeover Proposal.

Parent shall pay all filing fees required under the HSR Act or such other Antitrust Law by the Company and Parent. The parties may, as they deem advisable, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 6.03(d) or any other section of this Agreement as “outside counsel only.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall require Parent or any of its affiliates to propose, negotiate, effect, agree to or commit to, or execute any settlements, undertakings (affirmative or otherwise), consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity or any other Person obligating Parent or any of its affiliates to: (i) sell, divest, license or otherwise convey or hold separate any asset (whether tangible or intangible) or business of Parent or its affiliates or terminate any existing relationship, contractual right or obligation of Parent or its affiliates, (ii) sell, divest, license or otherwise convey or hold separate any asset (whether tangible or intangible) or business of the Company or its affiliates or terminate any existing relationship, contractual right or obligation of Company or its affiliates, (iii) create any relationship, contractual right or obligation of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates, or (iv) implement any limitations, prohibitions or restrictions affecting the business, operations or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates or on the ability of Parent or its affiliates to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of any Equity Interests in the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (including the right to vote such Equity Interests) or to control the business, operations or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates (each of the actions in the preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a “Remedial Action”), other than a Permitted Remedial Action (which Parent shall effect if necessary to obtain any Required Regulatory Approval expressly set forth on Section 7.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter); provided, that Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates shall only be required to agree to any Permitted Remedial Action if and to the extent ultimately necessary to obtain any Required Regulatory Approval expressly set forth on Section 7.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. A “Permitted Remedial Action” shall mean (a) a Remedial Action of the type described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof that, individually and in the aggregate with all other such Remedial Actions, involves assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that, in the aggregate, generated no more than 10% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and (b) proposals, agreements, commitments or undertakings from Parent to supply and provide Parent’s products and services on commercially reasonable terms to the Company’s competitors, consistent with past practice, provided that such proposals, agreements, commitments or undertakings, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a substantial impact on the benefits   54

that Parent reasonably expects it and its Subsidiaries to derive from the Transactions. The Company shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to propose, negotiate, effect, agree to or commit to, or execute any settlements, undertakings (affirmative or otherwise), consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity or any other Person obligating Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates to take or commit to take any Remedial Action without the prior written consent of Parent. Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require any party to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations pursuant to this Section 6.03 unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing. Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to defend, litigate or participate in the litigation of any Proceeding brought by or against any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any Authorization or Consent from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. (e) In addition to and without limiting any of the parties’ respective obligations in this Section 6.03, each of the Company, the Company Board, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) take all action, including granting such approvals, necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute, “business combination”, “control share acquisition”, “fair price”, “moratorium” or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute, “business combination”, “control share acquisition”, “fair price”, “moratorium” or similar Law becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and this Agreement. (f) The parties shall not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to, enter into any merger, acquisition or similar transaction, or any agreement to effect any such transaction, for any business that competes directly and materially with the other party’s business, that will make it materially more difficult, or materially increase the time required, to (i) obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals expressly set forth on Section 7.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, or (ii) avoid a Legal Restraint. 


SECTION 6.04. Continuing Employee Matters. (a) For the period from the Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Effective Time each employee of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company who remains in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (each, a “Continuing Employee”) shall receive (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and incentive compensation opportunities (other than equity incentive compensation opportunities, which instead will be consistent with the opportunities applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent and Subsidiaries of Parent) that, in each case, are not less favorable than as provided by the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) severance (based on severance arrangements as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and employee benefits (excluding defined benefit pension, post-employment health and welfare benefits, equity-based compensation and change of control, retention or other one-off awards) that are not less favorable in the aggregate to those that were provided by the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that, with respect to any Continuing Employee who is primarily based outside of the United States, the requirements of this Section 6.04(a) shall be subject to any requirements under applicable Law.   55








________________


(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause any plans, programs, agreements or arrangements established or maintained by Parent or any of its affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) (the “New Plans”) to recognize each Continuing Employee’s service with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any predecessor of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (to the extent such service is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary), for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized (i) for any purpose under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare plan, (ii) to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits, (iii) for purposes of any New Plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (iv) for purposes of any New Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. (c) With respect to any New Plan that is a welfare plan, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. (d) If requested by Parent not less than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as necessary to terminate the Company Benefit Plans that are United States Tax-qualified defined contribution plans (the “Company DC Plans”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. The form and substance of such resolutions and other actions taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to reasonable review and comment of Parent. If Parent requests that any Company DC Plan be terminated, the applicable Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a Tax-qualified defined contribution plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries (each such plan, a “Parent DC Plan”), it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation in a Tax-qualified defined contribution plan for such Continuing Employees. Upon the distribution of the assets in the accounts under the Company DC Plans to the participants, Parent shall take any action necessary to permit the Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” from the applicable Company DC Plan to the applicable Parent DC Plan (including in cash or notes (in the case of loans)).   56

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of the Company Benefit Plans (including any change in control severance agreement or other arrangement that is a Company Benefit Plan), in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), it being understood that the foregoing shall not limit the right of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to amend any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan containing a definition of “change in control” or “change of control” (or similar term), the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a “change in control” or “change of control” (or applicable term). (f) If Closing occurs prior to December 31, 2021, with respect to each cash incentive bonus program of the Company and its Subsidiaries with a performance period that is in-cycle as of the Closing (each, a “Company Bonus Program”), following the Closing, (i) payments pursuant such Company Bonus Program with respect to such performance period shall be paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and calculated excluding any merger-related transaction costs, and (ii) Parent shall not make any modification to such Company Bonus Program with respect to such performance period in a manner that is detrimental to any participant therein. (g) Parent and the Company agree to the additional items set forth on Section 6.04(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter. (h) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.07, this Section 6.04 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.04, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever (including any right to continued employment by or services with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries) under or by reason of this Section 6.04. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings or to continue the employment of any specific person. Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any such plan, program, policy, arrangement, agreement or understanding for any purpose.   57

SECTION 6.05. Indemnification. (a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to, (i) assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former director or officer (the “Indemnified Persons”) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as provided in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Person and the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof and, in the case of any indemnification agreement, as set forth in Section 6.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and of which the Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies), without further action, as of the Effective Time, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and (ii) during the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with the defense of any Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnified Person was a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnified Person in the Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Person), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law that the Surviving Corporation could provide such indemnification to such Indemnified Persons pursuant to the DGCL, the Company Charter or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable rights of indemnification and exculpation contemplated by this Section 6.05 and pursuant to the terms of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect at or immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be impaired by any modification of such terms in any amendment or restatement of such Company Charter or Company Bylaws following the Effective Time (including in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Merger). None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 6.05 (each, a “Claim”) for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. (b) Parent shall obtain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain in consultation with the Company, at or prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid (or “tail”) directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the   58








________________


Company’s or any of its Subsidiary’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies, with coverage for six years following the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable to the insureds than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.05(b) an amount in excess of 450% of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for such insurance for its current fiscal year; provided, further, that, if the amount necessary to procure such prepaid (or “tail”) insurance coverage exceeds such maximum amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall only be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such maximum amount. Parent shall cause the “tail” policy delivered in accordance with the preceding sentence to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section 6.05(b). (c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall make proper provision so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent’s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. (d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.05 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. The Indemnified Persons shall be express third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.05. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.05, Parent agrees that any indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance available to any Indemnified Person who at or prior to the Closing was a director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be secondary to the indemnification, advancement of expenses and insurance to be provided by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.05 and that Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (i) shall be the primary indemnitors of first resort for the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Section 6.05, (ii) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation from liabilities with respect to Indemnified Persons that are addressed by this Section 6.05 and (iii) shall not make any claim for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any other indemnification or insurance available to any Indemnified Person with respect to any matter addressed by this Section 6.05   59

SECTION 6.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.17 and this Section 6.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger and the other Transactions are consummated. (b) In the event that: (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); (ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d); or (iii) a Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) is made, proposed or communicated to the Company Board, any committee of the Company Board or management of the Company, or is publicly made, proposed or communicated publicly, or any Person or group publicly proposes or announces an intention to make a Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn), and thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or Section 8.01(g) and (B) within 12 months of such termination (1) any transaction included within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal is consummated or (2) the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of any transaction within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal, in each case whether or not involving the same Company Takeover Proposal or the Person or group making the Company Takeover Proposal referred to in this Section 6.06(b)(iii); provided that for purposes of clause (B), the term “Company Takeover Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.03, except that all references to “20%” in such definition shall be deemed references to “50.1%”, 


then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) a fee of $520,354,225 (the “Company Termination Fee”). Any fee due under this Section 6.06(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent (1) in the case of clause (i) above, prior to or simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of clause (ii) above, within three Business Days after the date of such termination of this Agreement and (3) in the case of this clause (iii), within three Business Days after the earlier of (x) the date of the consummation of the transaction referred to in clause (B)(1) thereof and (y) the date of entry into the definitive agreement referred to in clause (B)(2) thereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events.   60

Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without such right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

The parties hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. The foregoing shall not restrict any party’s right to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment, or to bring suit for the recognition or enforcement of any judgment obtained in any Chosen Court.

Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock after the date which is one (1) year following the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent upon demand. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not exchanged his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder’s shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person, including any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Compensatory Awards, including for any Merger Consideration, Option Consideration or D/RSU Consideration that is required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.   (g)               Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Article III, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses, and (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as directed by Parent.

  (h)               All Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and D/RSU Consideration issued or paid upon conversion of the Company Common Stock, the Company Options, the Company RSU Awards or Company DSU Awards, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSU Awards or Company DSU Awards, as the case may be.   Section 3.03       Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article III; provided, however, that the Paying Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such amount, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.   Section 3.04       Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, including consideration payable to any holder or former holder of Company Compensatory Awards, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment pursuant to the Code or under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide prior notice to the Company of any such deduction or withholding (other than (a) payroll withholding because of the compensatory nature of the applicable payment or (b) U.S. backup withholding) and shall cooperate with the Company to minimize or eliminate such deduction or withholding to the extent permitted by Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   Section 3.05       Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards.

 (a)               Company Options. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders thereof, be cancelled and terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, if any, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option (the “Option Consideration”), less any applicable withholding Taxes. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes, to each holder of such Company Option through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date). For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per share of any Company Option, whether vested or unvested as of the Effective Time, is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders thereof, the Company Option will automatically terminate and be canceled without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.   


21   


  (b)               Company RSU Awards; Company DSU Awards.   (i)                 Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as provided in Section 3.05(b)(ii), each Company RSU Award and each Company DSU Award that remains outstanding immediately prior thereto shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders thereof, be cancelled and terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU Award or Company DSU Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the “target” level of performance) and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the “DSU/RSU Consideration”), less any applicable withholding Taxes.   (ii)              Notwithstanding Section 3.05(b)(i), effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each New Company RSU Award that remains outstanding immediately prior thereto shall by virtue of the Merger automatically and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders thereof, be cancelled and terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the product of (A) number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such New Company RSU Award, and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days completed from the date of grant until the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 1095 and (ii) the Merger Consideration (collectively with the DSU/RSU Consideration, the “D/RSU Consideration”), less any applicable withholding Taxes.   (iii)            Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the D/RSU Consideration, less applicable withholding Taxes, to each holder of such Company RSU Award or Company DSU Award, as applicable, through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date or, with respect to Company DSU Awards, five Business Days following the Closing Date). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU Award or Company DSU Award that, immediately prior to such cancellation, was treated as “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Company RSU Awards or Company DSU Award if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.   


22   


  (c)               Certain Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, as applicable, any committee thereof administering any of the Company Stock Plans and having appropriate authority) shall, if necessary, adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as it deems necessary or advisable to effectuate the treatment of Company Compensatory Awards set forth in this Section 3.05. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are necessary to provide that, subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company Stock Plans shall terminate effective immediately prior to (and contingent upon) the Effective Time.   Section 3.06       Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal (each such share, a “Dissenting Share”), if any, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that such shares of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and shall no longer be outstanding, subject to the further provisions of this Section 3.06. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its right for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish his, her or its entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (iii) if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL and any right of such holder of Dissenting Shares to payment for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares, and each such right, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company (A) shall give Parent prompt written notice of all written demands received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (B) shall give Parent the opportunity to direct (provided that (1) the Company shall have the right to participate in and (2) prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reasonably consult in good faith with the Company with respect to) all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to any such demand. The Company shall not make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands for appraisal, in each case, without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  Section 5.08       Financial Capacity. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of (a) the executed Intermediate Holdco Commitment Letter and (b) the executed Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, none of the Commitment Letters have been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other commitment or arrangement relating to the financing of the Transactions, other than (i) as set forth in the Commitment Letters and the fee letters related thereto, as applicable, and (ii) customary non- disclosure or non-reliance agreements which do not impact the conditionality or aggregate amount of the Financing. As of the date hereof, assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Conditions and assuming that each of the conditions set forth in Article VIII are satisfied at Closing, the aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all “market flex” provisions related thereto), the Preferred Equity Financing and the Holdco PIK Financing, together with cash on hand, will be sufficient to consummate the Transactions, including, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and D/RSU Consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSU Awards and Company DSU Awards will be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) subject to Section 7.14, the repayment or refinancing of the Company Credit Agreement and (iii) the payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Holdings, Intermediate Holdco or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions. As of the date hereof, the commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been








________________


withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and represent valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent, Holdings and Intermediate Holdco, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, Merger Sub and Intermediate Holdco, each other party thereto (subject, in each case, to the Enforceability Exceptions) to provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions. Holdings, Parent and Intermediate Holdco have fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date hereof, assuming that each of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Holdings, Parent or Intermediate Holdco or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Intermediate Holdco, any other party thereto under any term of the Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Parent and Intermediate Holdco have no reason to believe, assuming that each of the conditions set forth in Article VIII are satisfied at Closing, that it or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Intermediate Holdco, any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of any of the Commitment Letters. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other than the Financing Conditions. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the applicable Financing on the Closing Date that will be included in the definitive documentation in respect of the applicable Financing shall be the Financing Conditions contained in the applicable Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Parent and Intermediate Holdco have no reason to believe that (A) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or (B) assuming satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions on the Closing Date, the Financing will not be made available to Parent or Intermediate Holdco, as applicable, on the Closing Date. With respect to any commitment letter (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto and any associated fee letter) governing any Replacement Commitment Facility (the “Replacement Facility Commitment Letter”), the parties hereto agree that upon delivery to Company of a fully executed version thereof, the Replacement Facility Commitment Letter shall be deemed a “Debt Commitment Letter” hereunder and Parent shall be deemed to, as of such date of delivery, make the same representations and agree to the same covenants contained herein with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter regarding such Replacement Facility Commitment Letter (it being understood and agreed that the Replacement Facility Commitment Letter may not have conditions precedent to the funding thereunder that are not substantially identical to (or are more expansive than) the conditions precedent to the funding of the second lien incremental term loan facility under the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof). Parent, Merger Sub and Intermediate Holdco expressly agree and acknowledge that their obligations hereunder, including Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger, are not subject to, or conditioned on, Parent’s, Merger Sub’s or Intermediate Holdco’s receipt of financing.

  Section 5.09       Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the Transactions with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any Parent, the Subsidiaries of Parent or any Acquired Company. Assuming (a) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Transactions and (b) the accuracy of the Company’s representations set forth in Article IV, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the payment of any amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all related fees and expenses, be solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. As used in this Section 5.09, the term “solvent” means, with respect to a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries have not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and (c) each of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business.   Section 5.10       Information in the Proxy Statement. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will, as of the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company’s stockholders and at the time of the meeting of the Company’s stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.   Section 5.11       Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities. All of the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its formation and the Transactions, including those matters incidental thereto, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Effective Time have incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person.

Section 5.13       Investment Intention. Parent is acquiring through the Transactions the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have not been registered under the Securities Act or any “blue sky” Laws and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act, any applicable “blue sky” Laws or pursuant to an exemption from any such registration.   Section 5.14       Absence of Certain Agreements. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Intermediate Holdco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (including the Guarantor and its Affiliates) has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), (i) with any Third Party that would, in any material way, be reasonably expected to limit Parent’s, Intermediate Holdco’s or Merger Sub’s ability to comply with Parent’s, Intermediate Holdco’s or Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement or (ii) with any Third Party that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent consummation of the Transactions. Parent is not aware of any matter related to Parent, Intermediate Holdco, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially delay, impede or interfere with the consummation of the Transactions.   Section 5.15       No Additional Representations and Warranties. Except as provided in this Article V or in any certificate to be delivered by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, any of their Subsidiaries, or with respect to any other information provided to the Company or their respective Affiliates in connection with the Transactions, including the accuracy, completeness or timeliness thereof.

53   


  (b)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.02(a), if at any time following the date hereof and prior to adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that did not result from a breach of Section 6.02(a) (other than any such breach that is immaterial and unintentional) and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may (1) furnish non-public information, and afford access to the books or records or officers of the Acquired Companies, to such Third Party and its Affiliates and Representatives and (2) engage in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party and its Affiliates and Representatives with respect to the Acquisition Proposal (provided, that any material non-public information concerning the Acquired Companies made available to any Third Party shall, to the extent not previously made available to Parent, be made available to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within 48 hours) after it is made available to such Third Party); provided, however, that the Company will not, will not permit any other Acquired Company or the Company Representatives to, disclose any material non-public information regarding the Acquired Companies to such Person without the Company first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person if such Person is not already party to a confidentiality agreement with the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.02(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives may, in any event (without the Company Board having to make the determination in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence), contact any Third Party to (i) seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by such Third Party solely to determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) inform such Third Party that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making an Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this Section 6.02.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board shall be permitted, subject to compliance with Section 6.02(d) and Article IX, (A) to terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement and/or (B) to effect any Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.02(c) shall be deemed to prohibit, and no Adverse Recommendation Change shall be deemed to have occurred in connection with, any of the actions permitted by Section 6.02(f).   


54   


  (d)               The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(h) unless, prior to adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Approval:   (i)              (A) an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.01(a) (other than a breach that is immaterial and unintentional) is made to the Company by a Third Party following the date hereof; (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (C) the Company has provided, at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance (or, if such seventy-two (72)-hour period does not include at least one (1) Business Day, ending on the first (1st) Business Day commencing after the passage of such seventy-two (72)-hour period), written notice (a “Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change”) to Parent that the Company intends to take such action (it being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes, as applicable, (1) written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, (2) an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement in respect of such Acquisition Proposal, (3) an unredacted copy of

  (ii)             (A) an Intervening Event has occurred; (B) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial and outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; (C) the Company has provided, at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance (or, if such seventy-two (72)-hour period does not include at least one (1) Business Day, ending on the first (1st) Business Day commencing after the passage of such seventy-two (72)-hour period), written notice (a “Notice of Intervening Event”) to Parent that the Company intends to take such action (it being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Intervening Event and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes reasonably detailed information describing the Intervening Event; (D) during such seventy-two (72)-hour period following the time of Parent’s receipt of the Notice of Intervening Event, the Company shall have, and shall have caused its directors, officers and employees to, and shall have used reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and Guaranty in response to such Intervening Event; (E) following the end of such seventy-two (72)-hour period described in the preceding clause (D), the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and Guaranty irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Intervening Event, that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.   (e)               From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article IX, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including, for avoidance of doubt, the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal), and (ii) the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects, on a reasonably current basis, of oral or written communications regarding, and the status and details (including material amendments or proposed material amendments) of, any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

Nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any environmental testing involving sampling of soil, groundwater or building materials, or other similar invasive techniques at any of the Acquired Companies’ properties without the prior written consent of the Company. All information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation or access permitted pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder but may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the applicable conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied.

(c)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent related to any Applicable Law, Parent shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) cooperate in good faith with the Governmental Authorities and shall undertake (and cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to undertake) promptly any and all action to complete lawfully the Transactions as soon as practicable (but in any event prior to the End Date) and any and all action necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement of any Proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority or the issuance of any Governmental Order that would (or to obtain the agreement or consent of any Governmental Authority to the Transactions the absence of which would) delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger, including (i) proffering and consenting and/or agreeing to a Governmental Order or other agreement providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition, or the holding separate of, or other limitations or restrictions on, or limiting any freedom of action with respect to, particular assets, categories of assets or lines of business and (ii) promptly effecting the disposition, licensing or holding separate of assets or lines of business, in each case, at such time as may be necessary to permit the lawful consummation of the Transactions on or prior to the End Date. The entry by any Governmental Authority in any Proceeding of a Governmental Order permitting the consummation of the Transactions but requiring any assets or lines of business to be sold, licensed or otherwise disposed or held separate thereafter (including the business and assets of the Acquired Companies) shall not, individually, or in the aggregate (together with one or more other changes, events, circumstances, developments or facts) be deemed a failure to satisfy any condition specified in Article VIII.

  (d)               Parent shall be solely responsible for and pay all filing and related fees required in connection with obtaining any consents or approvals of the type described in this Section 7.01.   Section 7.02       Proxy Statement.   (a)               Subject to Parent’s timely performance of its obligations under Section 7.02(b), as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary form, as required by the Exchange Act, relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”). Except as contemplated by the express terms of Section 6.02, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form, in all material respects, with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as of the record date established for the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in no event more than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and the Company shall consider in good faith the inclusion or reflection of any such comments so provided; provided, however, that the Company may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement without the review or comment of Parent in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.02. The Company agrees that none of the information supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that (i) notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or Representatives, or any of the Financing Sources, for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and (ii) updates thereafter in responses to claims shall not per se be deemed to be a breach for purposes of this Section 7.02(a).

  (b)               Parent shall, as promptly as possible, furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement, including such information that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon reasonable request of the Company, confirm and/or supplement the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, such information shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (c)               In accordance with the Company’s organizational documents, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.02(c) and the timing contemplated in Section 7.02(a)), (i) establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Company Stockholder Meeting”) and (ii) mail to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the Company Stockholder Meeting a Proxy Statement (such date, the “Proxy Date”). Without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), in no event shall the Proxy Date be changed to such a date that would result in the Company Stockholder Meeting being within 10 Business Days of the End Date, except as required by Applicable Law. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedures and matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; provided, however, that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting: (A) with the consent of Parent, (B) for the absence of a quorum, (C) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval or (D) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary under Applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.02, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for adoption at the Company Stockholder Meeting; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article IX.

  (d)               If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the Company’s or Parent’s respective Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the others. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading.   Section 7.03       Confidentiality; Public Announcements. Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 6.02(f) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall limit the rights of the Company or the Company Board under Section 6.02), prior to any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, and none of the parties or their Affiliates shall issue any such press release or public announcement prior to obtaining the other parties’ consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by Applicable Law or applicable stock exchange rule or any listing agreement of any party hereto. The Company may, without Parent’s or Merger Sub’s consent, communicate to its employees, customers, suppliers and consultants in a manner consistent with prior communications of the Company or consistent with a communications plan previously agreed to by Parent and the Company to the extent such prior communications are still accurate, in which case such communications may be made consistent with such plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth therein or herein, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and thereafter terminate and be of no further force and effect. Nothing in this Section 7.03 shall, but subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, prevent any Affiliate of Parent that is a private equity or similar investment fund, or any manager or general partner of any such fund, from reporting or disclosing with respect to fundraising, marketing, informational or reporting activities, on a confidential basis, to its partners, investors, potential investors or similar parties, general information regarding this Agreement and the Transactions, in each case subject to customary obligations of confidentiality with respect to non-public information such as transaction value or other specific economic terms. For the avoidance of doubt, any public filings providing notice to or seeking approval from any Governmental Authority made pursuant to Section 7.01 shall be governed by Section 7.01 and not this Section 7.03.

  Section 7.04       Indemnification of Officers and Directors.   (a)               From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former (in each case, as of the Effective Time) director, officer and employee of the Acquired Companies (each, a “7.04 Indemnitee”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, would have been permitted under or required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements or other organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement. Parent also agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses as incurred by each 7.04 Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted under or required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements or other organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies (i) to maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the 7.04 Indemnitees that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the certificates of incorporation, bylaws,








________________


indemnification agreements, and other organizational documents of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Applicable Law.   (b)               For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage; provided, however, that if any Proceeding is asserted or made against those Persons who are currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on or prior to the sixth (6th) year anniversary of the Effective Time, any insurance required to be maintained under this Section 7.04 shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may and (if the Company does not) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause coverage to be extended under the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance by obtaining at or prior to the Closing Date a prepaid, non-cancelable six (6)-year “tail” policy (containing terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.   (c)               Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 7.04 shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04. In addition, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that could reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 7.04.   


62   


  (d)               Parent shall assume, and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to honor, each of the covenants in this Section 7.04.   Section 7.05       Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are required to cause the disposition of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSU Awards, Company DSU Awards or other securities in connection with the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.   Section 7.06       Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of (and, if entered, to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned) any injunction, order, ruling, decree, judgment or similar order that results from any Proceeding against the Company or any of its directors by any holder of Company Common Stock arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company shall provide Parent with prompt notice of, and copies of all pleadings and correspondence relating to, any Proceeding against the Company or any of its directors by any holder of Company Common Stock arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis regarding any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Transactions, whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and give Parent the opportunity to participate in (but not direct or control) the defense, settlement or compromise of any such Proceeding, at Parent’s sole cost and expense, and no such settlement or compromise shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.   Section 7.07       Employee Matters.   (a)               For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (x) the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time and (y) the date on which the employment of a Continuing Employee terminates, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall provide each Continuing Employee with (i) an annual base salary and incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the annual base salary and incentive compensation opportunities (in each case, other than equity or equity-related compensation incentives) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) employee and fringe benefits (including vacation/leave, health, welfare and retirement benefits, but excluding for such purposes any equity or equity-related awards, incentive compensation, severance benefits, defined benefit pension benefits and retiree medical benefits) that are no less favorable than (A) those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and (iii) severance benefits and protections that are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, taking into account such Continuing Employee’s additional period of service and increases (but not decreases) in compensation following the Closing. Additionally, following the Closing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall assume, honor and perform in accordance with their terms the severance protections and benefits under the Plans set forth on Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   


63   


  (b)               Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent and its Affiliates shall recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize, each Continuing Employee’s employment or service with any Acquired Company (including any current or former Affiliate thereof or any predecessor of such Acquired Company) prior to the Closing for purposes of determining, as applicable, eligibility for participation, vesting and entitlement of the Continuing Employee under all employee benefit plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, including vacation plans or arrangements, 401(k) or other retirement plans and any severance or welfare plans, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plan and except to the extent such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent and its Affiliates shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods, actively at work requirements, evidence of insurability requirements or required physical examinations under any health or similar plan of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, except to the extent that any waiting period, exclusions or requirements still applied to such Continuing Employee under the comparable Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) fully credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing during the plan year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which such Continuing Employee has satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of- pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan year under any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan.

 (c)               In the event the Closing Date occurs prior to the payment of bonuses under the Company’s 2020 bonus program, Parent and its Affiliates shall cause each Continuing Employee to be paid such employee’s 2020 annual bonus pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in such program; provided, however, that in the event the Closing Date occurs on or prior to March 15, 2021, each Continuing Employee’s bonus shall be no less than such employee’s 2020 target annual bonus. Such annual bonuses shall be paid no later than March 15, 2021, subject to the Continuing Employee’s continued employment through the payment date; provided, however, that a Continuing Employee shall remain entitled to such employee’s 2020 bonus if such employee is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, in either event, prior to the payment date.   


64   


  (d)               If requested by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board will authorize the full vesting of all benefits under and termination of any and all Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Each Continuing Employee who is a participant in a 401(k) plan of the Acquired Companies will be allowed to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a tax qualified plan which includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code that is sponsored by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”). Parent will, or will cause an Affiliate to, take all actions necessary so that the Parent 401(k) Plan will accept rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans) from the 401(k) Plan of the Acquired Companies and Parent (or its Affiliate) will thereafter maintain such loan under the Parent 401(k) Plan.   (e)               The provisions of this Section 7.07 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee or other current or former employee, director, or consultant (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 7.07 shall create such rights in any such Persons or otherwise confer upon or give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 7.07 under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment or continued service for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason, (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to continue any Plans, or other employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time or (iii) amend any Plans or other employee benefit plans or arrangements.   Section 7.08       Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority or any other Person in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any Proceedings commenced or, to such party’s Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement or the Transactions, and (c) any Effect that has caused, or would reasonably be expected to cause, any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII not to be satisfied.   


65   


  Section 7.09       Stock Exchange Delisting. Prior to and following the Effective Time, the Company (and the Surviving Corporation) shall cause the Company’s securities to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time in compliance with Applicable Law, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect thereto.   Section 7.10       Merger Sub. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness or make any investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement and any matters incidental thereto.   Section 7.11       Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub covenant and agree that, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall not permit any of their Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business of any Person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any material assets if such business competes in any line of business of the Acquired Companies and the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (a) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (b) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering a Governmental Order prohibiting the consummation of Transactions, (c) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Governmental Order on appeal or otherwise or (d) materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions.   Section 7.12       Financing Cooperation.   (a)               The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any of its and their respective officers and employees of appropriate seniority and expertise to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide) such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing, including any Replacement Commitment Facility) as is reasonably requested by Parent; provided that the Company shall in no event be required to provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide) such assistance that shall unreasonably interfere with its or its Subsidiaries’ ongoing business operations. Such assistance shall include using reasonable best efforts to do the following, each of which shall be at Parent’s sole cost and expense:   (i)                 furnish, or cause to be furnished to, Parent, Merger Sub and Intermediate Holdco and the Financing Sources, the Required Information and such other information regarding the Acquired Companies as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of bank information memoranda, lenders’ presentations and other customary marketing materials relevant to the Debt Financing (provided that Parent acknowledges that the Company SEC Documents provide a substantial amount of such information under this clause (i) that Parent reasonably expects to require as of the date of this Agreement);

(b)               Notwithstanding Section 7.12(a), (i) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will be required to make any filings with the SEC in connection with the Financing (other than in any applicable proxy statement), (ii) nothing in this Section 7.12 shall require any such action to the extent it would (A) unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Acquired Companies or require the Acquired Companies to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or give any indemnities, in any case prior to the Closing, for which Parent does not promptly reimburse or indemnify it, as the case may be, under this Agreement or (B) require the Company, any Company Party or their respective Representatives to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any Financing Document that in each case would take effect prior to the Closing (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) in response to requests consistent with those set forth in clause (a)(v) above, certifications or other materials as may be required by bank regulatory authorities and (2) the Rep Letters), (iii) none of the Company Board or similar governing body of any other Acquired Company shall prior to the Closing be required to adopt resolutions approving any Financing Document that in each case becomes effective prior to the Closing and any such adoption or approval at Closing shall be performed by such board of directors (or other similar governing body) as constituted after the Effective Time and Closing, (iv) the Company’s obligations under this Section 7.12 shall be subject to the Financing Sources being bound by confidentiality agreements in accordance with customary market practice, and (v) none of the Acquired Companies shall be required to provide any information to the extent it would (A) cause significant competitive harm to any Acquired Company if the Transactions are not consummated, (B) violate Applicable Law or the provisions of any material Contract (including any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement) to which any Acquired Company is a party, (C) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (D) violate any applicable confidentiality obligation of any Acquired Company.   


67   


  (c)               The Company shall have the reasonable right to review marketing materials used in connection with the arrangement of the Financing prior to the dissemination of such materials to potential lenders or other counterparties to any proposed financing transaction (or filing with any Governmental Authority); provided that the Company shall communicate in writing its comments with respect to the Acquired Companies, if any, to Parent and its counsel within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances and consistent with the time accorded to other participants who were asked to review and comment on such marketing materials. The Company shall not be required to agree to any contractual obligation relating to the Preferred Equity Financing or the Holdco PIK Financing (without prejudice to clause (b)(i) above). The Company shall not be required to agree to any contractual obligation relating to the Debt Financing that is not conditioned upon the Closing and that does not terminate without liability to the Company and its Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement.

Financing on or prior to the Closing Date. Such actions shall include, but not be limited to, using reasonable best efforts to do the following: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters; (ii) cause the officers and employees of Parent and its Affiliates to participate in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iii) satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis all Financing Conditions; (iv)(A) negotiate, execute and deliver Debt Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any “market flex” provisions related thereto) or on such other terms acceptable to Parent and the applicable Financing Sources and (B) negotiate, execute and deliver the Preferred Equity Financing Documents and the Holdco PIK Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Intermediate Holdco Commitment Letter or on such other terms acceptable to Intermediate Holdco and the other parties to the Intermediate Holdco Commitment Letter; (v) in the event that the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 as to the obligations of Intermediate Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding would be satisfied, consummate the Financing (including consummation of the transactions required to satisfy clause (ii) of paragraph 6 of Annex III of the Debt Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof)); and (vi) enforce Parent’s or Intermediate Holdco’s rights under each Commitment Letter (including by seeking damages or taking other enforcement actions, including seeking an order of specific performance).   (b)               Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any actual breach or repudiation, or bona fide threatened in writing breach or repudiation, by any party to any Commitment Letter of which Parent or its Affiliates becomes aware. Without limiting Intermediate Holdco’s, Parent’s or Merger Sub’s other obligations under this Section 7.13, if any portion of the Financing becomes, or would reasonably be expected to become, unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the applicable Commitment Letter (after, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, taking into account flex terms), Intermediate Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such occurrence and the reasons therefor, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing in consultation with the Company, from the original Financing Sources or alternative financing sources (on terms containing conditions precedent to the consummation of such financing that are substantially identical to (and no more expansive than) the conditions precedent expressly set forth in the applicable Commitment Letter being replaced by such alternative financing as in effect on the date hereof), in an amount sufficient to replace any unavailable portion of the applicable Financing; provided, however, that in no event shall the foregoing require Intermediate Holdco, Parent and/or Merger Sub to agree to any terms or conditions materially less favorable (taken as a whole and taking into account any “market flex” provision) to Intermediate Holdco, Parent and/or Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Intermediate Holdco, Parent and/or Merger Sub), in each case relative to those set forth in the applicable Commitment Letter being replaced, and, and (iii) if and when available, provide the Company with a true and complete copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing. Upon any such replacement, amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waiver under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Intermediate Holdco Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 7.13(b), the term “Debt Commitment Letter” or “Intermediate Holdco Commitment Letter”, as applicable thereto (and consequently the terms “Debt Financing,” “Preferred Equity Financing,” “Holdco PIK Financing” and “Financing” shall mean the Debt Financing, the Preferred Equity Financing and the Holdco PIK Financing contemplated by such Commitment Letters as so replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived), shall mean such Commitment Letter as so replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or replace any of the Commitment Letters or any definitive documentation in respect of the Financing except (A) for substitutions and replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, (B) such amendments, modifications, supplements, restatements, assignments, substitutions or replacements that do not (1) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing thereunder (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof), or (2) impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any condition, to the receipt of any portion of the Financing; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt (x) Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, co-managers, syndication agents or other financing sources who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and, in connection therewith, amend the economic and other arrangements with respect to the appointment of such existing and additional entities (including in connection with any Second Lien Giveaway), (y) Intermediate Holdco may amend the Intermediate Holdco Commitment Letter to add investors, other financing sources or other parties who had not executed the Intermediate Holdco Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and, in connection therewith, amend the economic and other arrangements with respect to the appointment of such existing and additional entities and (z) Parent shall promptly furnish to Company copies of any such amendments, modifications, supplements, restatements, assignments, substitutions or replacements to or under the applicable Commitment Letter, and upon the execution and delivery thereof, any Debt Commitment Letter in respect of any Second Lien Giveaway or Replacement Commitment Facility. Other than as permitted under this Agreement, Parent shall not consent to any assignment of rights or obligations under any of the Commitment Letters without the prior written approval of the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall consult with and keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status of Parent’s efforts to arrange the Financing. Upon the reasonable written request of the Company, Parent will make commercially reasonable efforts to confirm (a) with the applicable Financing Sources their intent and ability to perform, and the availability of the applicable Financing under, the applicable Commitment Letter, subject only to satisfaction or waiver of the applicable Financing Conditions, and (b) that none of Parent, the Financing Sources or the Guarantor are aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of a Financing Condition. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that their obligations under this Agreement, including their obligations to consummate the Merger, are not subject to, or conditioned on, Parent’s or Merger Sub’s receipt of financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent or Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 10.02 and the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.03(b), as the case may be, under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 10.02 and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee.   (d)               Parent Termination Fee.

Nothing in this Section 9.03(e) shall in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which Parent or any other Parent Party may be liable under this Agreement or the Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 10.02 to effect the Closing and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.03(d), as the case may be, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 10.02 to effect the Closing and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

  (f)                Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in Sections 9.02 and 9.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor the Company would enter into this Agreement. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall (i) the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (ii) Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.   (g)               Any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03(b), Section 9.03(d) or this Section 9.03(g) shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds in accordance with this Section 9.03 to an account designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable (at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date such fee is to be paid). If the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails to pay when due any amount payable under Section 9.03(b) or Section 9.03(d), as applicable, and in order to collect such amount, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee or Parent for the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, then such party shall reimburse the other for all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with such suit.

  Section 10.02   Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Transactions). It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek to obtain an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the parties to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with the Company’s enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing shall be subject to the following requirements: (a) all conditions in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions that are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur, (b) the Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing, (c) the Company has confirmed that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.03 have been satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than conditions that are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing), and (ii) if the Financing is funded, then the Company would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur and (d) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Closing prior to the second Business Day following the delivery of such confirmation.   Section 10.03   No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties and covenants and agreements in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto by any Person shall terminate at the Effective Time other than those covenants or agreements of the parties which by their terms contemplate performance after the Effective Time or after termination of this Agreement.   Section 10.04   Amendments and Waivers.   (a)               Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that no amendment or waiver shall be made subsequent to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval that requires further approval of the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the DGCL without such further stockholder approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Lender Protective Provisions contained in this Agreement may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Financing or any Financing Related Person without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.   (b)               No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any right, power or privilege hereunder, unless the waiver of such right, power or privilege is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party, and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

  Section 10.05   Disclosure Letter References. The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) of such party that are contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The listing of any matter on a party’s Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by such party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be disclosed

by such party under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in a party’s Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by such party of any Contract or Applicable Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in a party’s Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of such party’s representations, warranties and/or covenants set forth in this Agreement.   Section 10.06   Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.   (a)               This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure solely to the benefit of and be enforceable by each party hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) 7.04 Indemnitees (and their successors, heirs and representatives) are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, Section 7.04, (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Compensatory Awards shall be intended third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, Articles II and III, and (iii) the Financing Related Persons shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, the Lender Protective Provisions.   (b)               Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 10.06(b) shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement (and all rights, interests and obligations hereunder) may be assigned, in whole or in part, without consent by each of Parent or Merger Sub (i) to any of its Affiliates or (ii) for collateral security purposes to any Persons providing financing to thereto pursuant to the terms thereof (including for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of such financing); provided that no such assignment shall affect or relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under this Agreement.   Section 10.07   Governing Law. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, or related to this Agreement, the Transactions, or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that any Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, against the Financing Related Persons in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letters, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provision thereof that would cause the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

  Section 10.08   Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto hereby expressly, irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any appeal thereof, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not to commence any such Proceeding except in such courts, (b) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such Federal court, (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such Federal court and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 10.08 in any such Proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 10.01. However, nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process on the other party in any other manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees (i) that any Proceeding of any kind or nature, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, against a Financing Related Person in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the Transactions, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) not to bring or permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such action or proceeding in any other courts, (iii) that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, and (iv) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such court.   Section 10.09   Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.09.   Section 10.10   Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.   Section 10.12   Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   Section 10.13   Non-Recourse. Without limiting the rights of the Company under and to the extent provided under Section 10.02, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the Transactions may only be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto (and the Guarantors in accordance with the Guaranty and any other Person named a party to any other agreement entered into in connection with the Transactions) and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein (or therein), with respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and the Guarantors in accordance with the Guaranty and any other Person named a party to any other agreement entered into in connection with the Transactions) (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party herein or therein, and not otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Financing Related Person, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of Company, Parent, Merger Sub or Intermediate Holdco under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) or of or for any Proceeding based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the Transactions; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.13 shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent under this Agreement or any Financing Related Person’s obligations to Parent or Intermediate Holdco under the Commitment Letters.

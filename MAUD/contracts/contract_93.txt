approvals and consents and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger specified in Article VI of this Agreement (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents to be delivered at Closing) (the “Approval Date”), provided, however, that if the Approval Date occurs during the month immediately prior to the start of Buyer’s next fiscal quarter the Closing shall occur on the last Business Day of the month in which the Approval Date occurs with an Effective Time as of 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month of the Buyer’s next fiscal quarter.

The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger related to the Merger (the “Articles of Merger”) that shall be filed with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation on the Closing Date. The “Effective Time” of the Merger shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger. (b) Holdco Merger Effective Time.

At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Interim Surviving Entity, and each such individual shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or otherwise in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Interim Surviving Entity.

________________


(a) Each share of Buyer Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger. (b) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be converted into and become one share of common stock, no par value, of the Interim Surviving Entity. (c) Each share of Company Common Stock (i) held as treasury stock or (ii) owned directly by Buyer (other than, in the case of clause (ii), shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired immediately prior to the Effective Time without any conversion, and no payment shall be made with respect to them. (d) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares described in Section 2.01(c) above) shall become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive 0.275 of a share (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Buyer Common Stock (the “Consideration”). The Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares paid pursuant to Section 2.04 are sometimes referred to collectively as the “Merger Consideration.” Section 2.02    Effects on Capital Stock of the Holdco Merger.

After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of shares of Company Common Stock. Section 2.04    Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock will be issued in the Merger.

of the Buyer Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent as provided by Bloomberg L.P. Section 2.05    Exchange Procedures. (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article II or evidence of shares in book entry form (“New Certificates”) and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent cash equal to the estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock (that cash and New Certificates, being referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). (b) A s promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, and provided that Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information that is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered their Certificate of Certificates, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided for in this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of the Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to which the former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and/or (ii) a check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock which the former holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.05(b), each Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares described in Section 2.01(c)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration as provided for in this Agreement and any unpaid dividends and distributions as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 2.05 and any unpaid dividend with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date that is prior to the Effective Time. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. For shares of Company Common Stock held in book entry form, Buyer shall establish procedures for delivery which shall be reasonably acceptable to Company. (c) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder shall surrender his or her Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.05. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.05, the record

holder shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions, without any interest, which had become payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by the Certificate. None of Buyer, Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect to them) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered, as required by Law, to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law. (d) The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and a New Certificate or New Certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.05, or an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and a bond in such amount as shall be required in each case by Buyer (but not more than the amount required under Buyer’s contract with its transfer agent). If any New Certificates evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting the exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other recordation Tax required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate for shares of Buyer Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that any Tax has been paid or is not payable. (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time (as well as any interest or proceeds from any investment of the Exchange Fund) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any stockholders of Company who have not complied with Section 2.05(b) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock the stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable Law, become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to the property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be deemed conclusive. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration

represented by the Certificate and file legal proceedings interpleading all parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims. (f) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock any amounts as Buyer (or any other applicable withholding agent) is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock for whom the deduction and withholding was made by Buyer (or any other applicable withholding agent). Section 2.06    Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted so as to provide the holders of the Company Common Stock the same economic benefit as contemplated by this Agreement prior to that event; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment shall be made with regard to Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer Common Stock and receives consideration for such shares (including, without limitation, upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or other equity awards) or (ii) Buyer issues employee or director stock grants or similar equity awards pursuant to a Buyer Benefit Plan. Section 2.07     Options and Restricted Stock. (a) Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (each sometimes referred to as an “Option,” and collectively sometimes referred to as the “Options”) granted under the Company’s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan and 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Company Equity Plans”), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been exercised or canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective Time, fully vest (to the extent not vested) and be canceled and, on the Closing Date, Company or Company Bank shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock provided for in each such Option, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration over (y) the Exercise Price (the “Cash Payment”). Any Option for which the Exercise Price exceeds the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment. For purposes of this Section 2.07(a), “Exercise Price” shall mean the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock provided for with respect to such Option. The Cash Payment shall be paid in cash within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, shall be made without interest and shall be less applicable tax withholdings. Company shall prohibit the exercise of any Option beginning on and after the fifth (5 ) trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. (b) Each award in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions granted under a Company Equity Plan that is 


th

(a) Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, nor are there any pending or, to Buyer’s Knowledge, threatened, civil, criminal, administrative or regulatory actions, suits, demand letters, claims, hearings, notices of violation, arbitrations, investigations, orders to show cause, market conduct examinations, notices of non-compliance or other proceedings of any nature against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Buyer, or challenge the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, or decree imposed upon Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries, or the assets of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, and neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has been advised of, or is aware of, the threat of any action.

(which will be paid by Buyer), none of Buyer, Merger Sub Buyer Bank, or any of their officers or directors has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any broker’s fees, commissions or finder’s fees in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 4.15    Employee Benefit Plans. (a) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies, or arrangements (whether or not written) (i) covering current or former employees of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) covering current or former directors of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) with respect to which Buyer or any Subsidiary has or may have any liability or contingent liability (including liability arising from affiliation under Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA) including, but not limited to, “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans (the “Buyer Benefit Plans”), are identified on Buyer Disclosure Schedule 4.15(a). True and complete copies of all Buyer Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and insurance contracts forming a part of any Buyer Benefit Plans and all amendments to them, IRS Forms 5500 (for the three most recently completed plan years), current summary plan descriptions, and the most recent IRS determination or opinion letters with respect to them, have been made available to Company, in each case, to the extent applicable. (b) All Buyer Benefit Plans are in compliance in form and operation with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each Buyer Benefit Plan which is an “employee pension benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a “Buyer Pension Plan”) and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS that is currently in effect, and no circumstance exists could result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of the Buyer Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is no pending or, to Buyer’s Knowledge, threatened litigation relating to the Buyer Benefit Plans.

    43








________________


transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, could subject Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. (c) Except as described in Buyer Disclosure Schedule 4.15(c), no liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated “single employer plan,” within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA (including any multiple employer plan as described in 29 C.F.R. Section 4001.2), currently or formerly maintained or contributed to by Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate. Neither Buyer nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to) a “multiemployer plan” within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time during the six-year period ending on the Closing Date, and neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, and does not expect to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate).

No Buyer Benefit Plan is considered to be an “at-risk” plan within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303 of ERISA. (e) To Buyer’s Knowledge, other than as set forth on Buyer Disclosure Schedule Section 4.15(e), neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material obligations for retiree health or life benefits under any Buyer Benefit Plan, other than coverage as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the Laws of any state or locality. All Buyer Benefit Plans that are group health plans have been, in all material respects, operated in compliance with the group health plan continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-609 of ERISA, the certification of prior coverage and other requirements of Sections 701-702 and 711-713 of ERISA and the terms and conditions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (f) No Buyer Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code. The execution of this Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

will not constitute a change in control, as such term is defined under any applicable Buyer Benefit Plan.

Section 4.16    Labor Matters; Employment. (a) Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract, or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is there any proceeding pending or, to Buyer’s Knowledge threatened, asserting that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it pending or, to Buyer’s Knowledge, threatened, nor, to Buyer’s Knowledge, any activity involving its employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational activity.

(a) Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all income, franchise, and other material Tax Returns that it was required to file under applicable Laws prior to the Effective Time, other than Tax Returns that are not yet due or for which a request for extension was filed consistent with requirements of applicable Laws. All such Tax Returns are correct and 


    45








________________


complete in all material respects and were prepared in substantial compliance with all applicable Laws. All Taxes due and owing by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been timely paid, other than any Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on the balance sheet of Buyer or which Buyer is contesting in good faith. Neither Buyer nor any Subsidiary is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, and neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries currently has any open tax years for which the applicable statute of limitations has been extended or suspended. N o written claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where Buyer or any Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by, or required to file a Tax Return in, that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, or Taxes that are being contested in good faith and for which adequate provision has been made on the balance sheet of Buyer) upon any of the assets of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries. (b) Buyer and each Subsidiary has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party. (c) N o foreign, federal, state, or local Tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are being conducted or to Buyer’s Knowledge are pending or threatened with respect to Buyer or any Subsidiary.

(d) Buyer and each Subsidiary have timely and properly taken such actions in response to and in compliance with notices Buyer or any Subsidiary has received from the IRS in respect of information reporting and backup and nonresident withholding as are required by Law. Buyer has not waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency and no request to waive or extend such a statute of limitations or time period has been filed or is currently pending. (e) Neither Buyer nor any Subsidiary has been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. (f) The unpaid Taxes of Buyer and each Subsidiary (i) did not, as of December 31, 2020, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (which is distinct and different from any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the financial statements of Buyer as of December 31, 2020 (rather than in any notes to such financial statements), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Effective Time in accordance with the past practice of Buyer in filing its Tax Returns. Since December 31, 2020 neither Buyer nor any Subsidiary 


    46








________________


has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP.

Neither Buyer nor any Subsidiary (i) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was Buyer), or (ii) has liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Buyer or any Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. (h) Neither Buyer nor any Subsidiary shall be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) “closing agreement” as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law); (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date; or (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date.

(j) Neither Buyer nor any Subsidiary is or has been a party to any “listed transaction”, as defined in Section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). (k) Neither Buyer nor any Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take any action, has failed to take or agreed not to take any action or has Knowledge of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger and the Holdco Merger, taken together, and the Bank Merger from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Section 4.18    Loans: Nonperforming and Classified Assets. (a) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to (i) any Loans under the terms of which the obligor was, as of March 31, 2021, over sixty (60) days delinquent in payment of principal or interest or in default of any other material provision, or (ii) Loan with any director, Executive Officer or five percent or greater shareholder of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or to Buyer’s Knowledge, any person, corporation or

Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement with any individual or group regarding Community Reinvestment Act matters and, to Buyer’s Knowledge, none of Buyer and its Subsidiaries has been advised of, or has any reason to believe (because of Buyer Bank’s Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the FDIC, or otherwise) that any facts or circumstances exist which would cause Buyer Bank: (i) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, and its implementing regulations, or to be assigned a rating for Community Reinvestment Act purposes by federal or state bank regulators of lower than “Satisfactory”; (ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 103), the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule, or regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the applicable privacy of customer information requirements contained in any federal and state privacy Laws, including, without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and its implementing regulations, as well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by Buyer Bank pursuant to 12 C.F.R.

Without limiting the preceding sentence, Buyer and Company shall (i) cooperate to develop all public announcement materials; and (ii) make appropriate management available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the other.

party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Company nor Buyer shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information, where access or disclosure could reasonably be expected to (i) violate the rights of such entity’s customers, (ii) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the entity in possession or control of such information, (iii) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties; (iv) violate any obligation of Company or Buyer with respect to confidentiality (provided that the party who owes an obligation of confidentiality makes a reasonable effort to obtain a waiver of such obligation) including with respect to disclosure of regulatory examination ratings or other confidential supervisory information, or violate any fiduciary duty of Company or Buyer; (v) interfere with the prudent operation of such entity; or (vi) contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the previous sentence apply. (b) N o investigation by a party or its representatives shall be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other party set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the respective obligations of Buyer and Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.09    No Solicitation by Company. (a) Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease, and Company and its Subsidiaries shall cause each of their respective representatives to immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal. Except as permitted by this Section 5.09, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiry with respect to, (ii) participate or engage in any negotiations with any Person with, or furnish any nonpublic information relating to, or (iii) engage or participate in any discussions with any Person regarding, a Company Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.09; provided, that, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, in the event Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its board of directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that such Company Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal and failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, further, that, prior to or concurrently with providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Company shall have provided such information to Buyer, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Company. Company will

________________


promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) advise Buyer following receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal and, if applicable, copies of any documents or correspondence evidencing such Company Acquisition Proposal) and will keep Buyer reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable Law and the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Company, to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.04(a), the board of directors of Company shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Buyer, its recommendation referred to in Section 5.04, or (ii) approve or recommend (or publicly propose to approve or recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal. Company shall not, its board of directors shall not allow Company to, and Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement (except for confidentiality agreements referred to and entered into in accordance with the terms of Section 5.09(a)) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal. (c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 shall prohibit Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, including Rule 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or, (ii) making any disclosure to Company’s stockholders if, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, Company determines that such disclosure would be required under applicable Law; provided, however, that any such disclosure relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless it is limited to a stop, look, and listen communication or Company’s board of directors reaffirms the recommendation referred to in Section 5.04 in such disclosure and does not recommend that Company stockholders tender their shares or otherwise support such Company Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.09. 


Section 5.10    Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer of Company and its Subsidiaries (the “Indemnified Parties”) and any person who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred after the Effective Time in connection with any claim,

action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, based in whole or in part, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, trustee or other agent of any other organization or in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of Company, including without limitation any matters arising in connection with or related to the negotiation, execution, and performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions it contemplates, to the full extent to which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled to have the right to be indemnified under the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement as though such Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws continue to remain in effect after the Effective Time and as permitted by applicable Law. Buyer shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the full extent as would have been permitted by Company under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if such officer, director or employee shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. Buyer’s obligations under this Section 5.10(a) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim; and provided further, that Buyer’s obligations as successor in interest to the Company shall continue as required under the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company. (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party and, if so, only to the extent of such actual prejudice. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party is prohibited by applicable Laws and regulations.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Company shall and if Company is unable to, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) with terms, conditions, retentions, and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as Company’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions it contemplates); provided, however, that in no event shall Company expend, or Buyer or the Surviving Entity be required to expend, for such “tail” policy in the aggregate a premium amount in excess of an amount (the “Maximum D&O Tail Premium”) equal to 200% of the annual premiums paid by Company for D&O Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement; provided further, that if the cost of such a tail policy exceeds the Maximum D&O Tail Premium, Company, Buyer or the Surviving Entity shall obtain a tail policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding Maximum D&O Tail Premium. (d) If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. (e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive, or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Company or its officers, directors and employees, and that the indemnification of this Section 5.10 is not a substitute for any claims under any policies. (f) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 5.10 are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1828(k)) and the regulations promulgated by the FDIC (12 C.F.R. Part 359). Section 5.11    Employees; Benefit Plans. (a) All Company Employees who remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be subject to Buyer Bank’s normal and customary employment procedures and practices, including customary background screening and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment performance. In addition, Company and Company Bank agree, upon Buyer’s reasonable request, to facilitate discussions between Buyer and Company Employees regarding employment, consulting, or other arrangements to be effective

prior to or following the Merger. Any interaction between Buyer and Company Employees shall be coordinated by Company. (b) Company Employees (other than those who are parties to an employment, change of control, or other type of agreement which provides for severance) as of the date of this Agreement who remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and whose employment is terminated by Buyer (absent termination for cause as determined by the employer) within one year after the Effective Time shall, subject to the execution by each Company Employee of a standard release, substantially in the form set forth in Buyer Disclosure Schedule 5.11(b), in favor of Buyer and Buyer Bank (if Buyer, in its discretion, requests that a release be signed), receive severance pay in a lump sum equal to the greater of the amount determined under (i) the East Boston Savings Bank Amended and Restated Employee Severance Compensation Plan as set forth in Company Disclosure Schedule 5.11(b), or (ii) eight weeks of base compensation. (c) Following the Closing Date, Buyer may choose to maintain any or all of the other Company Benefit Plans in its sole discretion, subject to the next sentence of this Section 5.11(c). For any Company Benefit Plan terminated for which there is a comparable Buyer Benefit Plan of general applicability, Company Employees shall be entitled to participate in the Buyer Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly- situated employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank (it being understood that inclusion of Company Employees in Buyer Benefit Plans may occur, if at all, a t different times with respect to different plans). With respect to a comparable Buyer Benefit Plan, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits, and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of benefits under any Buyer Benefit Plans, including any post-retirement welfare benefit plan of Buyer, but excluding any severance, vacation and/or paid time off plans), service by a Company Employee shall be recognized to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Plan in which such Company Employee was a participant immediately before the Effective Time, or if there is no such comparable employee benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under the Company 401(k) plan immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent applicable; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no coverage of any Company Employees who remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time or their dependents shall terminate under any of the Company’s health care plans prior to the time such employees or their dependents, as applicable, become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to similarly situated employees of Buyer and Buyer Bank and their dependents and, consequently, no such employees shall experience a gap in health care benefit coverage. If employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental, or health plan of Buyer or Buyer Bank upon termination of a similar plan of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall cause each plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health, or dental plans of Buyer or Buyer Bank, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide full credit under such plans for any deductible, co-payment, and out-of-pocket 


    68

expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the plan year prior to participation, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to the employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent the employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. (e) Buyer shall honor, and the Surviving Entity shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all vested benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees and directors of Company existing as of the Effective Time, as well as all employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or “change-in-control” agreements, plans, or policies of Company, but only if such obligations, rights, agreements, plans or policies, that individually or in the aggregate are material, are set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule. Buyer acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a “change-in-control” of Company for purposes of any benefit plans, agreements, and arrangements of Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer Bank to amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time after the Effective Time, subject to vested rights of employees and directors that may not be terminated pursuant to the terms of the Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans. (f) In the event that Buyer or Buyer Bank terminates or lays off a sufficient number of employees following the Effective Date to trigger a notice requirement under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar applicable Law (“WARN Act”) with respect to (i) Company Employees employed during the 90-day period preceding the Effective Time, and (ii) Company Employees employed by Buyer or Buyer Bank after the Effective Time, Buyer shall be solely responsible for compliance with, and any liabilities incurred pursuant to, the WARN Act. Company and Company Bank shall cooperate in providing information reasonably requested by Buyer that is necessary for Buyer to prepare and distribute notices that Buyer may desire to provide prior to the Effective Time under the WARN Act. (g) Company and Company Bank shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary to effect the actions set forth below relating to the ESOP and ESOP Loan. At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and no more than seven Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the ESOP shall be terminated (the “ESOP Termination Date”). No new participants shall be admitted on or after the ESOP Termination Date and all ESOP participants’ accounts shall become fully vested and 100% non-forfeitable. On the ESOP Termination Date, Company Bank shall direct the ESOP trustee to remit a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock held in the ESOP Loan suspense account (the “Suspense Shares”) back to Company Bank to repay the outstanding ESOP Loan in full. All remaining shares of Company Common Stock held by the ESOP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any unallocated shares held in the ESOP Loan suspense account (which shall not include any shares of Company Common Stock used for purposes of repaying or forgiving the ESOP Loans) shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Following

the Effective Time, the unallocated shares of Buyer Common Stock held in the ESOP Loan suspense account and any other remaining unallocated assets shall be deemed to be earnings and shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of the ESOP participants, whether or not such participant is actively employed by Company Bank on the ESOP Termination Date, based on their account balances under the ESOP as of the ESOP Termination Date and distributed to ESOP participants after the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS (only if Buyer requests that Company and Company Bank file such determination letter request with the IRS pursuant to this Section 5.11(g)), except as may be required by applicable Law or the terms of the ESOP. The ESOP shall be amended to provide that distributions under the ESOP after the Closing shall be made only in the form of Buyer Common Stock except with respect to any fractional shares or other de minimis cash distributions, which shall be distributed in the form of de minimus cash, or as otherwise required by applicable Law. If requested by Buyer, prior to the Effective Time, Company and Company Bank, and following the Effective Time, Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to commence the process to obtain such favorable determination letter (including, but not limited to, making such changes to the ESOP as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). Company, Company Bank, and following the Effective Time, Buyer, shall adopt such amendments to the ESOP and related trusts and resolutions to effect the provisions of this Section 5.11(g) (which amendments or resolutions shall be provided to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to adoption for Buyer’s review and approval). (h) Nothing in this Section 5.11, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.11. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 5.11 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director, or consultant of Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this Section 5.11 is intended (i) to amend any Company Benefit Plan or any Buyer Benefit Plan, (ii) interfere with Buyer’s or the Surviving Entity’s right from and after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Benefit Plan or (iii) interfere with Buyer’s or the Surviving Entity’s right from and after the Effective Time to terminate the employment or provision of services by any director, employee, independent contractor, or consultant. (i) If Buyer terminates Company’s 401(k) plan prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to permit Company 401(k) participants who are employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of such date to roll over any eligible rollover distributions in Company’s 401(k) plan into Buyer’s 401(k) plan, excluding those related to plan loans under Company’s 401(k) plan. Section 5.12    Notification of Certain Changes. Buyer and Company shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or which it believes would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time (and on the date prior to the Closing Date), Buyer and Company will supplement or amend their respective Disclosure Schedules

No supplement or amendment to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or Company Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.02(a) or 6.03(a), or compliance by Buyer or Company with the respective covenants and agreements. Section 5.13    Current Information. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Company will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis (not less than weekly) with representatives of Buyer and to report the general status of Company’s financial affairs and the ongoing operations of Company and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, (A) Company agrees to provide to Buyer (i) a copy of each report filed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Authority (if permitted by Law) within one (1) Business Day following its filing, and (ii) a consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated statement of operations, without related notes, within twenty (20) days after the end of each month, prepared in accordance with Company’s current financial reporting practices, and (B) Company shall provide Buyer, on a monthly basis, with a schedule of all new loans, leases, extensions of credit, and renewal loans, leases and extensions of credit, or any increase in any customer’s aggregate credit outstanding or lease commitment (whether or not subject to prior approval under Section 5.01(s)), and provide Buyer with a copy of, and the opportunity to discuss upon request, the relevant documentation for any loan, extension of credit, lease, or renewal. Section 5.14    Board Packages. Company shall distribute by overnight mail or by electronic mail a copy of any Company or Company Bank board package, including the agenda and any draft minutes, to Buyer at the same time in which it distributes a copy to the board of directors of Company or Company Bank; provided, however, that Company shall not be required to provide to Buyer copies of any documents that disclose (i) confidential discussions of this Agreement or the transactions it contemplates or any third-party proposal to acquire control of Company, (ii) any matter that Company’s board of directors has been advised by counsel may violate a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, including with respect to the disclosure of regulatory examination ratings or other confidential supervisory information, or may result in a waiver of Company’s attorney-client privilege or violate the privacy rights of any customer, or (iii) any information provided to Company’s or Company Bank’s board of directors or the Loan Committee of Company’s or Company Bank’s board of directors with respect to loan- or credit-related information, including, but not limited to, loan pricing or credit decisions.

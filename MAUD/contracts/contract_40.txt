(b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares (i) to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.5(a) and (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 2.7) shall at the Effective Time be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to the provisions of this Article II. (c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Stock (a “Certificate”) or (ii) shares of Company Stock held in book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except (subject to Section 2.7) the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.8.

Section 2.6 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a) the Effective Time and (b) any termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1, the outstanding shares of Company Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company Stock (including Company Equity Awards) the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.6 shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement. 


Section 2.7 Appraisal Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with Section 2.5(a)) and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (“Appraisal Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the “fair value” of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the “fair value” of such holder’s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5. The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the   20








________________


Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments, notices or demands served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal under the DGCL, approve any withdrawal of any such demands or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. 


Section 2.8 Exchange of Company Stock. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with a nationally recognized bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”). At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent an amount of cash necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in Section 2.8(g), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. (b) Exchange Procedures. (i) Certificates. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (of affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.   21

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares. (c) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates (or as promptly as practicable, in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Stock after the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of any Merger Consideration payable to such holder. (e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as provided in this Article II.   22

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment income or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Stock; provided, further, that any investment shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this Article II. If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations. 


Section 2.9 Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the holder thereof, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option (whether vested or unvested) shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect. Any such payment shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation’s regular payroll process, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Effective Time, and in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.   23

Any such payment shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation’s regular payroll process, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Effective Time, and in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. (c) Company PSUs. Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the holder thereof, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding and unvested Company PSU shall be (i) deemed earned based on the actual performance through the latest practicable date prior to the Closing, which level of actual performance shall be determined in good faith by the Company at or before the Closing, and (ii) canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (x) the resulting total number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company PSU multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporation’s regular payroll process, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the Effective Time, and in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. (d) Company Restricted Stock. Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the holder thereof, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically vest in full and all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions) otherwise applicable to such vested Company Restricted Stock shall lapse, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.5; provided that any payment in respect of Company Restricted Stock held by an Employee (or other Person subject to compensatory withholding) shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation’s regular payroll process and subject to all applicable withholding. (e) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions and take any other actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of Company Equity Awards contemplated by this Section 2.10 and to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent, the Company nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Stock, other Company Securities or other compensation of any kind (other than amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.10) to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any Company Equity Awards under the Company Equity Plan or otherwise and that the Company Equity Plan will thereupon terminate.   24

(f) Non-U.S. Employees. Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held by Employees subject to non-U.S. Law in a manner other than that contemplated above in this Section 2.10 to the extent necessary to take into account applicable non-U.S. Law or Tax or employment considerations; provided such treatment is not materially adverse to such Employees, as determined by Parent and the Company. 


Section 2.11 Withholding. Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and any other applicable withholding agent hereunder, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent under the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter.

Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing and satisfied all of the other terms and conditions required to be satisfied by Parent on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing will not be satisfied, nor does Parent have Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that the full amount of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing will not be made available to Parent as of the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2 in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter.

For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Solvent”, when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the sum (without duplication) of (A) the value of all “liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities”, as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.   47

Section 6.2 Director and Officer Indemnification. (a) For a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each former and present director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, a “Company Indemnified Party”) against any costs, expenses (including advancing attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim to the fullest extent permitted by Law upon receipt, if required by applicable Law, organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any applicable Indemnification Agreement, of a written undertaking by such Company Indemnified Party or on such Company Indemnified Party’s behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not permitted to be indemnified under applicable Law, organizational documents or indemnification agreement), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by Law and as provided in the respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement and made available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (an “Indemnification Agreement”). All rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, as provided in the respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or its Subsidiaries or in any Indemnification Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the Company Indemnified Parties shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all the terms thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Company Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.2, the provisions of this Section 6.2 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims relating thereto. (b) For a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws and comparable organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of the Company (or in such documents of any successor thereto) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, during such six (6)-year period, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who immediately before the Effective Time was a Company Indemnified Party, except as required by applicable Law.   55

(c) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) continue to maintain in effect for a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time the Company’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies (the “D&O Insurance”) in place as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) purchase comparable D&O Insurance (from a carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s D&O Insurance carrier) for such six (6)-year period, in each case, with coverage for the persons who are covered by the Company’s existing D&O Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Company’s existing D&O Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an aggregate or total premium amount in excess of 350% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (such 350% amount, the “Premium Cap”); provided, further, that if the amount necessary to procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Premium Cap, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase the most advantageous policy available for an amount not to exceed the Premium Cap. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid “tail policy” for a period of no more than six (6) years after the Effective Time with coverage for the persons who are covered by the Company’s existing D&O Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the Company’s existing D&O Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (provided that the aggregate premium for such “tail” policy shall not exceed the Premium Cap), in which event Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section 6.2(c). The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail policy” in full force and effect for a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. (d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to succeed to or assume the applicable obligations of such Party set forth in this Section 6.2. (e) The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall survive consummation of the Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise. 


Section 6.3 Employee Matters. (a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter for twelve (12) months (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, immediately following the Closing (the “Continuing Employees”) with (i) base salary or other base cash compensation that is at least the   56








________________


same as, in the aggregate, the base salary or other base cash compensation that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term target cash incentive compensation opportunities (including short-term annual cash incentive compensation but excluding equity or equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the aggregate total short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance and any other termination pay and benefits plans, practices and policies that are no less favorable than such plans, practices and policies that were applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) other employee benefits (other than any defined benefit pension, retiree welfare, short-term and long-term bonus and short-term and long-term incentive opportunities, change in control and equity or equity-based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those employee benefits (other than any defined benefit pension, retiree welfare, short-term and long-term bonus and short-term and long-term incentive opportunities, change in control and equity or equity-based compensation) in effect for such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. The terms and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be governed by the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement subject to the expiration, modification or termination of such Collective Bargaining Agreement in accordance with its terms or applicable Law. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the right of Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to (A) terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time for any or no reason, (B) change or modify the terms or conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee to the extent such change is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 6.3 or (C) adopt, terminate, change or modify any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with its terms; provided that such change or modification does not otherwise violate the requirements of this Section 6.3. (b) For purposes of eligibility to participate, level of paid time off and severance benefits, and vesting of retirement benefits (but not benefit accrual, unless required by applicable Law or previously accrued or vested benefits) under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Parent and its respective Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing (the “New Benefit Plans”), each Continuing Employee shall be credited for service to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Continuing Employee as was credited by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under similar or comparable Company Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (except (x) for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit plans and (y) to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits or coverage). With respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately before such commencement of participation. For purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, for the plan year in which the Closing occurs Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any   57








________________


such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing. Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred and paid by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the plan year of the Company Plan in which the Closing Date occurs to be taken into account under such New Benefit Plan in such plan year for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit Plan. (c) In the event that the Closing occurs in 2021, each Continuing Employee participating in any Company Plan that is an annual bonus plan, policy or arrangement during the 2021 calendar year shall remain eligible to receive a cash bonus equal to the cash bonus such Continuing Employee would have otherwise received in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Company Plan (including all employees employed on December 31, 2021, other than any such employees who is thereafter terminated for “cause” or who voluntary resigns without “good reason”), and based on actual performance, to be paid to the Continuing Employee by the Surviving Corporation at the same time such bonuses would have otherwise been paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. If the Closing has not occurred by December 1, 2021, and the Company reasonably determines that the Closing may not occur prior to December 31, 2021, the Company, in consultation with Parent, may accelerate the payment of such bonuses and the ability of such employees to exercise any Company Stock Options, if and to the extent that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, such accelerated payment and accelerated option exercisability would reasonably be expected to mitigate any adverse consequences to the recipient or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that might otherwise reasonably be expected to arise under the provisions of Section 280G or 4999 of the Code (provided that if the Company deems it necessary or appropriate to encourage or facilitate the exercise of Company Stock Options to mitigate such adverse tax consequences, the Company, in consultation with Parent, may, to the extent otherwise permitted under its applicable plans and programs, permit the exercise of such Company Stock Options on a net settlement basis and permit the satisfaction of any associated Tax liability or withholding through share withholding); provided, in each case, that in no event may any such action increase any liability for Parent, the Company or such disqualified individuals under Section 409A of the Code or materially increase the value of any such payments. (d) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to comply in all material respects with all notice, consultation, effects bargaining or other bargaining obligations to any labor union, labor organization, works council or group of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in order to comply with such obligations. (e) The terms of this Section 6.3 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Continuing Employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any participant or beneficiary in any Company Plan or any other Person or Governmental Authority (whether as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise) other than the parties hereto. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to constitute an establishment, amendment or termination of any Company Plan or other   58

compensation or benefit plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to (x) maintain any particular benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement or (y) retain the employment or any particular term or condition of employment of any particular employee; or (iii) prevent the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from adopting, amending or terminating any benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.1, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take any action to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority (including in connection with the HSR Filing, the Ex-U.S. Filings, the FERC Application, the NJDEP Application, the FCC Filing and the CFIUS Notice) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and, in any event, prior to the End Date, including (i) the prompt use of its best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (A) the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, rights, product lines, categories of assets or businesses or other operations or interests therein of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect thereto, including the entry into hold separate arrangements, terminating, assigning or modifying Contracts (or portions thereof) or other business relationships, accepting restrictions on business operations and entering into commitments and obligations) and (B) the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to take such other actions, and promptly to effect such other actions (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect thereto, including the entry into hold separate arrangements, terminating, assigning or modifying Contracts (or portions thereof) or other business relationships, accepting restrictions on business operations and entering into commitments and obligations), in each case if such action should be necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x) commencement of any Proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance of any Order that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority, (ii) defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Authority, seeking to delay past the End Date, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) taking, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with its terms unlawful or that would delay past the End Date, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened Order so as to permit such consummation as promptly as practicable and, in any event, prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to, solely in connection with the CFIUS Notice, take any action pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) that would have a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent or the Company to agree to any divestiture or other remedy not conditioned on the consummation of the Closing.   61

be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may, in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, furnish nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group (or any of their Representatives) making such Company Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group and their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that (x) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or group or their respective Representatives, the Company enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (y) promptly (but not more than forty-eight (48) hours) after furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company’s Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify the terms and conditions of any bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section 7.2 solely to determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (B) permit a Person to request a waiver of a “standstill” or similar obligation and grant such a waiver (unless the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law) and (C) inform a Person or group that has made a Company Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this Section 7.2. (c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries by any Third Party who has made or could reasonably be expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall (i) indicate the identity of the Third Party who has made or could reasonably be expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) include a copy of any written documents or agreements delivered to the Company or its Representatives in connection with such inquiry, proposal or offer (or, if not delivered in writing, a summary of the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request). Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within one (1) Business Day), regarding any material changes to the status and material terms of any such inquiry, proposal or offer (and shall provide Parent with a copy of any written documents or agreements delivered to the Company or its Representatives that contain any material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof (or, if not delivered in writing, a summary of any such material amendments or material changes)).

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions herein to the contrary, prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into a definitive agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.2(d): (i) the Company Board shall provide Parent at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice (a “Notice”) of its determination to take such action, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and, in the case of an Intervening Event, the reasonable detail thereof, and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the terms and conditions of such proposal, including a copy of any proposed definitive agreements relating to such proposal; (ii) during the five (5) Business Days following such written notice (the “Notice Period”), the Company Board and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable; and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable (A) the Company Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) the Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; provided that any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 7.2(e); provided, further, that the new Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days. (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that this Section 7.2(f) shall not permit the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent otherwise permitted by this Section 7.2; provided, further, that a request by Parent for the Company to publicly recommend against a Company Acquisition Proposal may not be made more than twice with respect to any Company   64

For the avoidance of doubt, any “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; provided that the Company does not make any recommendation in connection therewith other than a recommendation against any Company Acquisition Proposal. 


Section 7.3 Financing. (a) Prior to Closing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt Financing or any Substitute Debt Financing as promptly as possible (taking into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) following the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, no later than the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) (A) maintain in effect the Debt Letters and to comply with its obligations under the Debt Letters to the extent the failure to comply with such obligations would adversely impact the amount or, taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, the availability of the Debt Financing at the Closing, (B) negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing reflecting the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Letters (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto) or on terms that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Letters (including any “market flex” provisions applicable thereto), so that such agreements are in effect no later than the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2 and (C) enforce their rights under the Debt Letters and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all the conditions and covenants applicable to Parent or Merger Sub in the Debt Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto that are to be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub in Parent’s or Merger Sub’s control (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing). In the event that all conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived, Parent and Merger Sub shall obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons providing the Debt Financing (the “Debt Financing Parties”) to fund the Debt Financing at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to shares to be paid for pursuant to the Merger. (b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the Debt Financing and material developments with respect thereto and upon the Company’s reasonable written request, provide the Company with copies of any final material definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly (and in no event less than one Business Day) after obtaining knowledge thereof, give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any breach or default by any party to the Debt Letters or the definitive documentation related to the Debt Financing, (ii) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing Source Party with respect to any (A) actual breach, default, termination (other than in accordance with   65

its terms) or repudiation by any part to any of the Financing Letters or, to the extent entered into and effective prior to the Closing Date, the definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Debt Letters or (B) material dispute or material disagreement relating to the Financing with respect to the obligations to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing) or (iii) if for any reason Parent in good faith no longer believes it or Merger Sub will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documentation related to the Debt Financing. Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt Letters without the prior written approval of the Company, provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without Company’s prior written consent, permit any such amendment, modification, assignment, termination or waiver to be made to, or consent to or agree to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the Debt Letters which would (A) reduce the aggregate net cash amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing, unless the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding amount on substantially the same terms as provided in the Debt Letters) except to the extent after giving effect to such termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement, the aggregate net proceeds contemplated from the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing (as terminated, amended, modified, waived or replaced), together with other financial resources of Parent, including contemplated cash on hand of Parent, is, in the aggregate, sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection therewith, (B) impose new or additional conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing, in any case, from those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement or (C) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Letters or the Debt Financing in a manner that in the case of this clause (C) would reasonably be expected to (I) impair, delay or prevent or make less likely the consummation of the Merger or the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) at the Effective Time, taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period, (II) materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to enforce their rights against the Debt Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (III) adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may amend, replace, supplement and/or modify the Debt Letters solely to add additional Debt Financing Parties as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Letters as of the date hereof. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall permit or consent to any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to be made to the Equity Commitment Letter (other than to increase the amount of the Equity Financing). In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt Letters permitted pursuant to this Section 7.3, such new commitment letters shall be deemed to be a “Debt Commitment Letter” for all purposes of this Agreement and/or together with such new fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the “Debt Financing” and deemed to be the “Debt Letters” for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly deliver to the Company true, correct and   66

complete copies of any termination, amendment, modification or replacement of the Debt Letters. If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (x) notify the Company thereof, (y) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute debt financing from the same or alternative debt financing sources (on terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions as set forth in the Debt Letters, taking into account any “market flex” provisions thereof) in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is and remains available to Parent or Merger Sub, together with cash on hand at Parent and its Subsidiaries, to enable Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the payment for shares of Company Stock by Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof (the “Substitute Debt Financing”) and (z) promptly after execution of any new debt financing commitment letter that provides for such Substitute Debt Financing, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new debt commitment letter and the related fee letters (redacted to remove the fee amounts, pricing caps, the rates and economic terms included in the “market flex” and related to “securities demand” provisions contained therein and certain other economic terms, none of which redacted provisions cover terms that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect conditionality, enforceability or availability of, or the aggregate amount available under the Debt Financing) and related definitive financing documents with respect to such Substitute Debt Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute Debt Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the “Debt Financing” and any commitment letter for such Substitute Debt Financing shall be deemed a “Debt Commitment Letter,” and together with the related fee letters the “Debt Letters” for all purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent require or be deemed or construed to require Parent to seek equity financing from any source or in excess of the amount set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parent’s nor Merger Sub’s obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Debt Financing, any Substitute Debt Financing or any other financing. (d) Prior to Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to, and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent such customary cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in connection with arranging the Debt Financing (which for purposes of this clause (d) shall include one or more offerings of non-convertible high yield debt securities to be issued or incurred in lieu or in replacement of any bridge financing contemplated by the Debt Letters) and the satisfaction of the conditions as set forth in the Debt Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) furnish to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (or, in the case of financial statements set forth in paragraph 4 of Exhibit D to the Debt Letters (as in effect on the date of this Agreement), within the time period set forth therein) (A) the Required Information and (B) such other pertinent and customary financial and operating information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent to the   67

(c) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) or Section 9.1(b) (iii), or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii), and, in each case, (i) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, a Company Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company and publicly announced or disclosed (and such Company Acquisition Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn in a bona fide manner prior to the earlier of (x) the date of the Company Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) and (y) the date of such termination) and (ii) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company (A) consummates a transaction with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal and such Company Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated, then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent (or one or more of its designees), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Company Termination Fee, reduced by any amount previously paid under Section 9.3(b) within two (2) Business Days following the consummation of such transaction arising from such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that for purposes of the definition of “Company Acquisition Proposal” in this Section 9.3(c), references to “15%” and “85%” shall be replaced by “50%”.

(e) If the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 9.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against such Party for any amount due pursuant to this Section 9.3, then such Party shall pay the other Party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this Section 9.3 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made (or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law) (any such amount, the “Enforcement Expenses”); provided that in no event shall the Enforcement Expenses payable by the Company, on the one hand, or the Enforcement Expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate. The Parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Company Termination Fee, the Reverse Termination Fee and the Enforcement Expenses is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. All payments under this Section 9.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable. In no event shall the Company Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee be payable more than once. (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) in the event that this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 9.3, Parent’s right to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable, the Enforcement Expenses, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, the Debt Financing Source Parties or any of their respective Affiliates and any of their respective, former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or Representatives (the “Parent Related Parties”) against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or Representatives (the “Company Related Parties”) for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise (including in the event of a fraud or Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 9.3, subject to Section 10.12, the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee and, if applicable, the Enforcement Expenses, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against any of the Parent Related Parties for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise (including in the event of a fraud or Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement in the event Parent or Merger Sub fails to consummate the   81

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise fails to comply with or breaches any covenant or other obligation or representation or warranty in this Agreement (including in the event of a fraud or Willful Breach) shall not exceed an aggregate amount greater than the sum of (A) the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee and (B) $7,000,000 (such sum, the “Parent Liability Limit”) and (iv) in no event will the Company or any other Company Related Party seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Parent Related Party with respect to this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by the Sponsor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any claims or actions under applicable Laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure (including in the event of a fraud or Willful Breach), other than from Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement or the Sponsor or the Equity Investor (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter) pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter; provided that nothing in clauses (ii) through (iv) above shall limit, abridge or otherwise modify (A) any remedies available to the Company under the Confidentiality Agreement or (B) any obligations of Parent pursuant to the last sentence of Section 7.3(f). For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific performance and (B) the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, any Enforcement Expenses or any monetary damages.

This Section 10.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time. 


Section 10.2 Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the Parties at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; provided that after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no amendment that requires further stockholder approval under applicable Law shall be made without such required further approval; provided, further, that Section 9.3, this Section 10.2, Section 10.8, Section 10.11, Section 10.12(c), Section 10.13 and Section 10.14 (and any defined term used in such Sections to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such defined term would directly modify the substance of such Sections) shall not be amended in any manner materially adverse to the Debt Financing Source Parties without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Source Parties. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 or an amendment or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.2 or Section 10.3 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, action by their respective board of directors (or a committee thereof) or sole member, as applicable.   82

Section 10.3 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement of the other Parties or (c) subject to the second proviso of the first sentence of Section 10.2, waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Party of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall act on behalf of Merger Sub and the Company may rely on any notice given by Parent on behalf of Merger Sub with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 10.3.

The listing of any matter on the Company Disclosure Letter in and of itself shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be disclosed by the Company under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by the Company of any Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

Section 10.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, is not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties intend that the remedies and limitations contained in Section 9.3(e) and Section 9.3(f) be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a Party’s liability or obligations hereunder or under the Equity Commitment Letter. 


Section 10.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided that each of Parent and Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time; provided, further, that any assignment by Parent or Merger Sub shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 


Section 10.11 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise set forth in the Debt Letters as in effect as of the date of this Agreement (including as it relates to (a) the interpretation of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect (and whether or not a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred), (b) the determination of the accuracy of any Specified Acquisition Agreement Representation (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent has the right to terminate its obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) or decline to consummate the Closing as a result thereof pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and (c) the determination of whether the Closing has been consummated in accordance with the terms hereof, which will, in each case, be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of Laws thereof), all matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Source Parties in any way relating to the Debt Letters or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.   86

Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction. (a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the limitations in Section 9.3(f), the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the obligations to consummate the Merger, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, prior to a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1 the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to draw down the proceeds of the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter and to make the payment of the Merger Consideration (including via enforcement of the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms) and to cause the Effective Time to occur and to consummate the Closing, in each case, if, and only if, each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or waived at the time when the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied and will be satisfied at the Closing), (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter if the Equity Financing is funded, (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger at the time when the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2, (D) the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur, and (E) Parent does not consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days after delivery of the written notice specified in clause (D) above. The Parties’ rights in this Section 10.12 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 10.12. (b) In addition, each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction and (iv) consents to service of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 10.6.   87








________________


(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party agrees (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Source Parties in any way relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of the Debt Letters or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the County of New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom). 


Section 10.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE DEBT LETTERS, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT THERETO). 


Section 10.14 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future Debt Financing Source Party or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) or of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby.

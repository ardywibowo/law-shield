As a result of the Merger, the separate existence of VEREIT shall cease, and Merger Sub 1 shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”) and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Realty Income, with its corporate name changed to “Realty Income MD Subsidiary I, Inc.” The Merger will have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the MGCL.

Section 1.2            Closing. The closing of the Mergers (the “Closing”) will take place on the date that is the second (2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of those conditions as of the Closing), unless another date is agreed to in writing by Realty Income and VEREIT (the date on which the Closing occurs, the “Closing Date”).

The bylaws of Merger Sub 1 as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.   (b)           The limited partnership agreement of VEREIT OP as in effect immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall be the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving VEREIT OP, with such changes, effective after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as may be determined by Realty Income in its sole discretion prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of such limited partnership agreement.   Section 1.4             Directors and Officers.

ARTICLE II TREATMENT OF SECURITIES   Section 2.1            Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties or the holders of any of the securities of the parties, the following shall occur:   (a)           VEREIT Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.3(e), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of VEREIT (the “VEREIT Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into a number of newly issued shares of Realty Income Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. As a result of the Merger, all shares of VEREIT Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as shares of VEREIT Common Stock, and each evidence of shares in book-entry form previously evidencing shares of VEREIT Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “VEREIT Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate previously representing shares of VEREIT Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “VEREIT Common Stock Certificates”) shall thereafter represent the right to receive the shares of Realty Income Common Stock into which such shares of VEREIT Common Stock were converted, in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.   (b)           VEREIT Series F Preferred Stock. Each share of VEREIT Series F Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, but the holders thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time shall retain the right to receive, and shall receive, the payment of the VEREIT Series F Preferred Stock Redemption Amount with respect to each share of VEREIT Series F Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of the Series F Preferred Stock Redemption Notice issued pursuant to Section 5.16.

4   




  (ii)              Treatment of Realty Income Common Stock. Each share of Realty Income Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall remain outstanding following the Merger as a share of Realty Income Common Stock.   Section 2.2            Effect on Partnership Interests. As of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of any of the parties or the holders of any of the securities of the parties, the following shall occur:   (a)           Limited Liability Company Interests in Merger Sub 2. All of the limited liability company interests of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall, collectively, be converted into and become a number of common units of partnership interest in Surviving VEREIT OP (each, a “Surviving VEREIT Partnership Common Unit”) equal to the number of VEREIT Partnership Common Units owned by the VEREIT OP Minority Partners (as defined below), which shall be held by Realty Income.   (b)           VEREIT Partnership Common Units Held by VEREIT. Each VEREIT Partnership Common Unit that is owned by VEREIT immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, including each VEREIT Partnership Common Unit that constitutes VEREIT’s general partnership interest in VEREIT OP and each VEREIT Partnership Common Unit that constitutes VEREIT’s limited partnership interest in VEREIT OP (the “ VEREIT Partner Units”), shall remain outstanding as one Surviving VEREIT Partnership Common Unit and, immediately following the Effective Time, shall be held by the Surviving Corporation, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c)           VEREIT Partnership Common Units Held by VEREIT OP Minority Partners. Subject to Section 2.3(e) , each VEREIT Partnership Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time owned by a holder of VEREIT Partnership Common Units other than VEREIT (each such holder, a “VEREIT OP Minority Partner”) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive a number of newly issued shares of Realty Income Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.

  (d)           VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Units Held by VEREIT. Each VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Unit that is owned by VEREIT immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (the “VEREIT Series F Preferred Partner Units”) shall remain outstanding as one Series F Preferred Unit in Surviving VEREIT OP (each, a “Surviving VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Unit”) and, immediately following the Effective Time, shall be held by the Surviving Corporation, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of Surviving VEREIT Partnership

As a result of the Partnership Merger, all VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time owned by a VEREIT OP Minority Partner shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each evidence of such VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Units in book-entry form previously evidencing such VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (the “VEREIT Book-Entry Partnership Series F Preferred Units,” and, together with the VEREIT Book-Entry Shares and VEREIT Book-Entry Partnership Series F Preferred Units, the “VEREIT Book-Entry Securities”) and each certificate previously representing such VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (the “VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Unit Certificates,” and, together with the VEREIT Common Stock Certificates and the VEREIT Partnership Common Unit Certificates, the “VEREIT Certificates”) shall thereafter represent the right to receive the VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Payment Amount, in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.   Section 2.3             Exchange of Certificates.   (a)           Exchange Agent.

Such certificates and evidence of shares in book-entry form for shares of Realty Income Common Stock (together with any deposited cash sufficient to pay the fractional share consideration and any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) so deposited are hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund.”

  (b)           Exchange Procedures.   (i)                 As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), Realty Income shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of one or more VEREIT Certificates as of immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (with respect to the VEREIT OP Minority Partners) or the Effective Time (with respect to the holders of VEREIT Common Stock), (1) a letter of transmittal (a “Letter of Transmittal”), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the VEREIT Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the VEREIT Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Realty Income may reasonably specify, and (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of (A) in the case of VEREIT Certificates other than VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Unit Certificates, the VEREIT Certificates in exchange for certificates or, at Realty Income’s option, evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the shares of Realty Income Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and Section 2.2(c), together with, in the case of Realty Income Common Stock, any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Realty Income Common Stock pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.3(c) and any cash such holder is entitled to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Realty Income Common Stock pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.3(e), or (B) in the case of VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Unit Certificates, the consideration payable under Section 2.2(e).

As of immediately after the Effective Time, each such Realty Income RSU Award shall be credited with a dividend equivalent balance that is equal to the dividend equivalent balance credited on the corresponding VEREIT RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.5(b), each VEREIT RSU Award assumed and converted into a Realty Income RSU Award pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding VEREIT RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including dividend equivalent rights and including all time and service vesting conditions, but excluding performance vesting conditions).

As of their respective dates, the VEREIT SEC Documents at the time filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such filing) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such VEREIT SEC Documents, and none of the VEREIT SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of VEREIT included in the VEREIT SEC Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of VEREIT and its consolidated Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows of such companies as of the dates and for the periods shown.

Since December 31, 2018, any material change in internal control over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any VEREIT SEC Document has been so disclosed.   (iii)            Except as set forth on Section 3.1(d)(iii) of the VEREIT Disclosure Letter, VEREIT has made available to Realty Income complete and correct copies of all written correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and VEREIT, on the other hand, since December 31, 2018.

(v)              Since December 31, 2018, (A) neither VEREIT nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of VEREIT, any Representative of VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls relating to periods after December 31, 2018, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices (except for any of the foregoing after the date hereof which have no reasonable basis), and (B) to the knowledge of VEREIT, no attorney representing VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported to the Board of Directors of VEREIT or any committee thereof evidence of a material Violation of securities Laws or breach of fiduciary duty relating to periods after December 31, 2018, by VEREIT or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents.   (e)            Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by VEREIT for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 or the Form 10 will, at the time the applicable Form is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined below) will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the times of the meetings of stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the OfficeCo Distribution Prospectus will, at the date of effectiveness of the Form 10 and of mailing to stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

None of VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries is, and to VEREIT’s knowledge no other party is, in breach, default or Violation (and no event has occurred or not occurred through VEREIT’s or any Subsidiary of VEREIT’s action or inaction or, to VEREIT’s knowledge, through the action or inaction of any third party, that with notice or the lapse of time or both would constitute a breach, default or Violation) of any term, condition or provision of any VEREIT Material Contract to which VEREIT or any Subsidiary of VEREIT is now a party, or by which any of them or their respective properties or assets may be bound, except for such breaches, defaults or Violations as would not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a VEREIT Material Adverse Effect.

(b)          For purposes of any New Plans providing benefits to any VEREIT Employees after the Effective Time, Realty Income shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the VEREIT Employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except, with respect to pre-existing conditions or exclusions, to the extent such pre-existing conditions or exclusions would apply under the analogous VEREIT Benefit Plan; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each VEREIT Employee and their eligible dependents under any New Plan with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the portion of the plan year of the corresponding VEREIT Benefit Plan ending on the date such VEREIT Employee’s participation in the New Plan begins (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous VEREIT Benefit Plan prior to the date that the VEREIT Employee first participates in the New Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the New Plan; and (iii) recognize all service of the VEREIT Employees with VEREIT and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessors or affiliates thereof), for all purposes in any New Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the same extent such service was taken into account under the analogous VEREIT Benefit Plan prior to the date that the VEREIT Employee first participates in the New Plan; provided, however, that the foregoing clause (iii) shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits, or (B) for any purpose with respect to any defined benefit pension plan, postretirement welfare plan or any New Plan under which similarly situated employees of Realty Income and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation.

  (c)          If the parties agree (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, VEREIT shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the VEREIT Benefit Plans that are Tax- qualified defined contribution plans (collectively, the “VEREIT Qualified DC Plan”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the review and comment of Realty Income (which comments shall be considered by VEREIT in good faith).

After the Effective Time, Realty Income shall maintain such directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary insurance policies in full force and effect for each of their full six (6) year terms and continue to honor its respective obligations under each policy.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any obligation of Realty Income to maintain and honor insurance policies pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall survive the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution.   (d)          Realty Income shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9; provided, that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such expenses to the extent it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law.   (e)          The provisions of this Section 5.9 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Realty Income and VEREIT shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby, and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.   Section 5.10          Dividends.   (a)          From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement, neither VEREIT, VEREIT OP nor Realty Income shall make, declare or set aside any dividend or other distribution to its respective stockholders or unitholders without the prior written consent of VEREIT (in the case of Realty Income) or Realty Income (in the case of VEREIT or VEREIT OP); provided, however, that the written consent of the other party shall not be required for the declaration and payment of regular quarterly cash dividends by VEREIT and the declaration and payment of regular quarterly cash distributions by VEREIT OP or monthly (in the case of Realty Income) cash dividends in accordance with past practice at a rate not in excess of the regular cash dividend most recently declared prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to each of the shares of VEREIT Common Stock, shares of VEREIT Series F Preferred Stock, VEREIT Partnership Series F Preferred Units, VEREIT Partnership Common Units and shares of Realty Income Common Stock, respectively, subject to customary increases in accordance with past practices (it being agreed that the timing of any such distributions will be coordinated so that, if either the holders of VEREIT Common Stock or the holders of shares of Realty Income Common Stock receive a distribution for a particular period prior to the Closing Date, then the holders of shares of Realty Income Common Stock and the holders of VEREIT Common Stock, respectively, shall receive a distribution for a comparable period prior to the Closing Date).   (b)          Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, each of VEREIT and Realty Income, as applicable, shall be permitted to declare and pay a dividend to its stockholders, the record date and payment date for which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date, distributing any amounts determined by such party (in each case in consultation with the other party) to be the minimum dividend required to be distributed in order for such party to qualify as a REIT and to avoid to the extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income or excise Tax (any dividend paid pursuant to this paragraph, a “REIT Dividend”).

  (c)           If either party determines that it is necessary to declare a REIT Dividend, it shall notify the other party at least twenty (20) days prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, and such other party shall be entitled to declare a dividend per share payable (i) in the case of VEREIT, to holders of VEREIT Common Stock, in an amount per share of VEREIT Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the REIT Dividend declared by Realty Income with

respect to each share of Realty Income Common Stock and (B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) in the case of Realty Income, to holders of shares of Realty Income Common Stock, in an amount per share of Realty Income Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the REIT Dividend declared by VEREIT with respect to each share of VEREIT Common Stock by (y) the Exchange Ratio. The record date and payment date for any dividend payable pursuant to this Section 5.10(c) shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date.   Section 5.11          Public Announcements. VEREIT and Realty Income shall use reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution) shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, or as required in connection with required notifications or filings under the HSR Act or any foreign antitrust, competition, or merger control Law or in response to any request by a Governmental Entity investigating the transactions described herein, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution). In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or OfficeCo Distribution Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1 or as otherwise permitted under Section 5.4, or as required in connection with required notifications or filings under the HSR Act or any foreign antitrust, competition, or merger control Law or in response to any request by a Governmental Entity investigating the transactions described herein, no party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party or the other party’s business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   Section 5.12        Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest Realty Income with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of VEREIT, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.   Section 5.13          Tax Matters.   (a)        VEREIT and Realty Income agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties shall treat the Merger as a tax-free “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Code and no party shall take any position for tax purposes inconsistent therewith, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.   (b)         Realty Income shall, with VEREIT’s good faith cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer, recording, registration, stamp or similar Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, “Transfer Taxes”) and VEREIT and Realty Income shall cooperate to minimize the amount of such Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law. In addition, VEREIT and Realty Income shall cooperate in good faith to minimize (i) the recognition of built-in gain under Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7(b), and (ii) any state Taxes, in each case, imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    Section 5.14          Financing Cooperation.   (a)           Consistent with applicable Laws, VEREIT shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and its Subsidiaries’ respective officers and employees to use reasonable best efforts to, provide to Realty Income and its Subsidiaries, at Realty Income’s sole expense, all cooperation as may be reasonably requested in writing by Realty Income that is necessary in connection with (i) the Realty Income Credit Agreement Amendment and the Realty Income PPN Amendment, (ii) the arranging, obtaining and syndication of the OfficeCo Debt Financing (as defined in Exhibit A)and (iii) one or more equity or debt offerings of Realty Income, that Realty Income and its Subsidiaries may pursue prior to the Effective Time (any such transaction in clause (ii) or (iii) a “Financing”), including, without limitation, in the event such action is customary in connection with the applicable Financing, using reasonable best efforts to: (i) cooperate with customary marketing efforts relating to such Financing, including assisting in the preparation of customary confidential information memoranda, private placement memoranda, lender presentations, prospectuses, offering memoranda and other customary offering documents and marketing materials; (ii) assist in the preparation of rating agency presentations and participate in a reasonable number of meetings with rating agencies, roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and meetings with prospective lenders and debt and equity investors, in each case, by audio or videoconference at such times as coordinated reasonably in advance thereof at mutually agreed times; (iii) deliver documentation and other information reasonably requested by sources of such Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable with respect to (x) applicable “know-your-customer”, FINCEN and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and (y) the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in each case, to the extent such information is required pursuant to the applicable Financing; (iv) deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable all financial information and real property and other diligence materials related to VEREIT and its Subsidiaries customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of such Financing; (v) direct VEREIT’s independent auditors to cooperate with Financing that is a securities offering consistent with their customary practice, including requesting VEREIT’s independent accountants to prepare and deliver customary comfort letters (it being understood that such customary comfort letters shall include a SAS 100 review of any interim financial statements and “negative assurance” comfort covering any “stub” period) if customary for such Financing, in connection with any Financing to the applicable underwriters, arrangers, initial purchasers or placement agents thereof in each case, on customary terms and consistent with the customary practice of such independent accountants; (vi) assist with the preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma financial statements solely with respect to VEREIT to the extent customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing, including, if applicable, of the type that would be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act for a public offering of securities of Realty Income and for Realty Income’s preparation of pro forma financial statements; (vii) assist in the preparation of customary projections, estimates and other forward looking financial information regarding the future performance of VEREIT to the extent customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing; and (viii) the execution and delivery of such definitive financing documents, including certificates, credit agreements, note purchase agreements, dealer manager agreements, solicitation agent agreements, authorization letters, guarantees, schedules, legal opinions and other documents, as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate such Financing, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the party executing such document; provided that any such documents referred to in this clause (viii) shall be effective no earlier than the Effective Time (other than any authorization letters that are required to be given in advance of such time in order for the Financing to be consummated on or after the Effective Time). VEREIT hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries’ logos in connection with any Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or is reasonably likely to harm or disparage VEREIT or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of such party or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between Realty Income and VEREIT or its affiliates, the parties hereto agree that Realty Income may share with the sources of such Financing customary projections and other confidential information with respect to VEREIT (including information about VEREIT’s Subsidiaries) after giving effect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby that the parties have cooperated in preparing, and that Realty Income, its Subsidiaries and such sources of Financing may share information about VEREIT and its Subsidiaries (notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement) with potential sources of the Financing in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with the Financing, provided that the recipients of such information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to VEREIT.

  (b)          During the period from the date of this Agreement and the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1 (the “Interim Period”), Realty Income or one or more of its Subsidiaries may (i) commence any of the following: (A) one or more offers to purchase (including any “change of control offer” under the VEREIT Notes Indenture and/or the notes issued thereunder) any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the VEREIT Notes Indenture for cash (collectively, the “Offers to Purchase”); or (B) one or more offers to exchange any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the VEREIT Notes Indenture for securities issued by the Realty Income or any of its affiliates (the “Offers to Exchange”); and (ii) solicit the consent of the holders of debt issued under the VEREIT Notes Indenture regarding certain proposed amendments thereto (the “Consent Solicitations” and, together with the Offers to Purchase and Offers to Exchange, if any, the “Note Offers and Consent Solicitations”); provided that any such notice or offer shall expressly reflect that, and it shall be the case that, the closing of any such transaction shall not be consummated until the Effective Time. Any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations shall be made on such terms and conditions (including price to be paid and conditionality) as are proposed by Realty Income and which are permitted by the terms of the VEREIT Notes Indenture and applicable Laws, including SEC rules and regulations. Realty Income shall consult with VEREIT regarding the material terms and conditions of any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, including the timing and commencement of any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations and any tender deadlines. Realty Income shall have provided VEREIT with the necessary offer to purchase, offer to exchange, consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal, press release, if any, in connection therewith, and each other document relevant to the transaction that will be distributed by Realty Income in the applicable Note Offers and Consent Solicitations (collectively, the “Debt Offer Documents”) a reasonable period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Note Offers and Consent Solicitations to allow VEREIT and its counsel to review and comment on such Debt Offer Documents, and Realty Income shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made or input provided by VEREIT and its legal counsel. Subject to the receipt of the requisite holder consents, in connection with any or all of the Consent Solicitations (including for the avoidance of doubt any other liability management transaction hereunder that includes a Consent Solicitation), VEREIT shall execute a supplemental indenture to the VEREIT Notes Indenture in accordance with the terms thereof amending the terms and provisions thereof as described in the applicable Debt Offer Documents in a form as reasonably requested by Realty Income (the “Supplemental Indenture”); provided that the amendments effected by such supplemental indenture shall not become operative until the Effective Time. During the Interim Period, at Realty Income’s sole expense, VEREIT shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and their Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Realty Income to assist Realty Income in connection with any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations (including using reasonable best efforts to direct VEREIT’s independent accountants to provide customary consents for use of their reports to the extent required in connection with any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations). The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations will be selected and retained by Realty Income. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Realty Income or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, discovers any information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, such party that discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Realty Income describing such information shall be disseminated to the holders of the notes outstanding under the VEREIT Notes Indenture.   (c)          Realty Income shall promptly, upon request by VEREIT, reimburse VEREIT and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out- of-pocket costs and expenses paid to third parties (including advisor’s fees and expenses) incurred by VEREIT and its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 5.14 and indemnify and hold harmless VEREIT, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and other Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (collectively, “Losses”) suffered or incurred by them in connection with any Financing, any information utilized in connection therewith or any action taken by VEREIT or any Subsidiary of VEREIT pursuant to this Section 5.14, in each case, whether or not the Merger is consummated or this Agreement is terminated; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply with respect to any Losses resulting from any gross negligence or willful misconduct of VEREIT or its Subsidiaries or Representatives or a Willful Breach of VEREIT or any Subsidiary of VEREIT under this Agreement.   




72   




  (d)           Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 5.14(a), neither VEREIT nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to Section 5.14 that (i) would unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of VEREIT or its Subsidiaries, (ii) would require VEREIT, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors or officers of VEREIT or its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of any Financing or any Note Offers or Consent Solicitations or execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement, in each case, that is effective prior to the Effective Time, or that would be effective if the Effective Time does not occur (other than (x) authorization letters contemplated b y Section 5.14(a)(viii) and (y) to the extent required to be executed or delivered prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 5.14(a)), (iii) would cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) would require VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee prior to the Effective Time or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with any Financing or any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations prior to the Effective Time, or have any obligation of VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective until the Effective Time, (v) could reasonably be expected to cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (vi) could reasonably be expected to conflict with the organizational documents of VEREIT or its Subsidiaries or any Laws, (vii) could reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any contract to which VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (viii) would require providing access to or disclosing information that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries, (ix) would require delivering or causing to be delivered any opinion of counsel in connection with any Financing or any Note Offers or Consent Solicitations (other than to the extent required by Section 5.14(b) in connection with the entry into a Supplemental Indenture, an opinion of counsel if the trustee under the VEREIT Notes Indenture requires an opinion of counsel to VEREIT) or (x) could reasonably be expected to cause VEREIT to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes (including by reason of potential payments under Section 5.14(c) from such action).   (e)           Upon the request of Realty Income, VEREIT shall use reasonable best efforts to, and cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and its Subsidiaries’ respective officers and employees to use commercially reasonable efforts to, facilitate the payoff of the VEREIT Credit Agreement, including obtaining a customary payoff letter in connection therewith (the “Credit Agreement Payoff”); provided that any such action described above shall not be required unless it can be and is conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing.   (f)           For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 5.14 represent the sole obligation of VEREIT, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any Financing to be obtained by Realty Income or any of its Subsidiaries and OfficeCo with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the parties’ obligation to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent upon the completion of any Financing, any Note Offers or Consent Solicitations or the Credit Agreement Payoff. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedule hereto), any breach by VEREIT of any of the covenants required to be performed by it under this Section 5.14

  Section 5.15          Separation and OfficeCo Distribution.   (a)          From and after the date hereof, unless the condition set forth in Section 6.3(f) shall have been satisfied or irrevocably waived by Realty Income, each of VEREIT and Realty Income shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to, as promptly as practicable, consummate and make effective, on the Business Day following the Closing, the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution, in each case, in accordance with the terms set forth on Exhibit A, including (i) preparing and causing to be executed all agreements necessary to effect the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution, including a separation and distribution agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) containing, among other provisions, the terms contemplated therefor on Exhibit A, (ii) effectuating the transfer of the OfficeCo Properties to OfficeCo or Subsidiaries thereof and obtaining any Consents and making any notifications required in connection therewith in accordance with the terms set forth on Exhibit A, (iii) determining and electing or appointing the individuals who will comprise OfficeCo’s board of directors and management team upon consummation of the OfficeCo Distribution in accordance with the terms set forth on Exhibit A, (iv) preparing and causing a registration statement on Form 10 (such registration statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Form 10”) to be filed by OfficeCo with respect to the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution with, and declared effective, by the SEC, and keeping the Form 10 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the OfficeCo Distribution and the transactions contemplated thereby, and (v) obtaining all requisite corporate and other approvals, authorizations and declarations, and obtaining a customary solvency opinion in connection therewith, if necessary. In addition, from and after the date hereof, unless the condition set forth in Section 6.3(f) shall have been satisfied or irrevocably waived by Realty Income, and except as expressly permitted or required pursuant to Section 5.15(d), VEREIT shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, refrain from taking any action after the date of this Agreement that, to Viking’s knowledge, would reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution on terms consistent with the terms set forth in Exhibit A by the Spin-off Outside Date.   (b)          Each party shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party with copies of any written comments and advise such other party of any oral comments with respect to the Form 10 received from the SEC, and each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any filing, amendment or supplement to the Form 10, or any responses to comments received from the SEC, prior to filing such with the SEC. In addition, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the OfficeCo Distribution, and shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock or shares of common stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each party will advise the other party promptly after it receives notice of the time when the Form 10 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the securities of OfficeCo issuable in connection with the OfficeCo Distribution for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Form 10. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to either of the parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either party, and such information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form 10 so that it would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by Law, the parties shall cooperate to cause OfficeCo to promptly file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information. In addition, each of VEREIT and Realty Income shall promptly advise the other party upon receiving any written communication from any Governmental Entity and any material written communication given or received in connection with any legal proceeding by a private party, in each case in connection with the Separation or the OfficeCo Distribution and reasonably cooperate to respond to any such communication.   




74   




    (c)           In furtherance of (and without limiting) the foregoing obligations in this Section 5.15, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to consult and cooperate with each other with respect to the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution, and each party shall keep the other party informed on a reasonably timely basis of the status of matters related to the Separation and the OfficeCo Distribution. In the event that the parties do not agree on the terms of the Separation or the OfficeCo Distribution or actions to be taken in furtherance thereof (including with respect to the terms set forth on Exhibit A), Realty Income shall, acting in good faith and after consultation with VEREIT, have the ultimate decision-making authority.                  (d)           (i)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.15 or Section 5.4, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Realty Income, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and other Representatives may, directly or indirectly, and in the event that Realty Income requests cooperation from VEREIT in connection therewith, VEREIT and its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees and other Representatives may, to the extent requested or approved by Realty Income, directly or indirectly, (x) solicit, initiate, propose, facilitate, induce or encourage any proposals from third parties which to acquire all or any portion of the OfficeCo Properties (each, an “OfficeCo Proposal”), including by furnishing to any Person or its Representatives any information relating to the OfficeCo Business; (y) continue, enter into, participate in or otherwise engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Person or its Representatives with respect to one or more OfficeCo Proposals; and (z) otherwise cooperate with, assist, participate in or take any action to facilitate any OfficeCo Proposals.   (ii)           Realty Income shall reasonably consult with and consider in good faith any comments of VEREIT with respect to any OfficeCo Proposal, and shall keep VEREIT informed on a reasonably timely basis of the status of matters related thereto. In addition, upon written request from Realty Income, VEREIT shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Realty Income and its Subsidiaries in connection with the activities set forth in Section 5.15(d)(i), including by participating in the strategy with respect to the marketing and sale of any such OfficeCo Properties, and affording to any Person or its Representatives reasonable access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information regarding the OfficeCo Properties, subject to any such Person and/or its Representatives entering into a customary non-disclosure agreement with VEREIT.   




75   




    (iii) At any time prior to the Effective Time, Realty Income and its Subsidiaries may negotiate and, acting in good faith and after consultation with VEREIT, enter into one or more binding agreements with third party purchasers providing for the sale of all or any portion of the OfficeCo

Properties on such terms as determined by Realty Income (each, including any ancillary documentation related thereto, an “OfficeCo Sale Agreement”), and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, and, the parties agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate the entry into such OfficeCo Sale Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, provided, however, that, with respect to each OfficeCo Sale Agreement, if such sale relates to OfficeCo Properties owned by VEREIT or its Subsidiaries, (A) either (1) such sale is conditioned upon the closing of the Merger, or (2) Realty Income complies with the indemnification requirements of Section 5.15(d)(iv) with respect to such sale, (B) such sale (1) shall not occur prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time and (2) shall not occur prior to the Effective Time if such sale would reasonably be expected to cause VEREIT to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal Tax purposes and (C) such OfficeCo Sale Agreement (1) does not obligate VEREIT or its Subsidiaries to pay any material consent, termination or other similar fee that is payable prior to the Closing (unless Realty Income agrees to reimburse VEREIT or its Subsidiaries for such fees and such reimbursement would not reasonably be expected to cause VEREIT to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal Tax purposes), (2) may be terminated by VEREIT or its Subsidiaries, or shall be automatically terminated, in each case, if this Agreement is terminated, and (3) does not create any material obligations, commitments or liabilities for VEREIT or its Subsidiaries that would survive the termination of such OfficeCo Sale Agreement or this Agreement (an OfficeCo Sale Agreement that satisfies the foregoing requirements, a “Qualifying OfficeCo Sale Agreement”). Upon written request from Realty Income, VEREIT shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and facilitate such sale or sales, including affording to any Person or its Representatives reasonable access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other information regarding any applicable OfficeCo Properties owned by VEREIT or its Subsidiaries, subject to any such Person and/or its Representatives entering into a customary non-disclosure agreement with VEREIT.   (iv) With respect to any sale of OfficeCo Properties owned by VEREIT or its Subsidiaries otherwise made in accordance with this Section 5.15, Realty Income may make an irrevocable election (the “OfficeCo Sale Election”), by written notice to VEREIT (the “OfficeCo Sale Notice”), to require that VEREIT or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, enter into one or more Qualifying OfficeCo Sale Agreements on such terms as determined by Realty Income and, subject to the terms and conditions thereof and any applicable third-party consent or other rights, to sell, immediately prior to the Effective Time, all or any portion of the OfficeCo Properties owned by VEREIT or its Subsidiaries (an “OfficeCo Sale”), in each case, as specified by Realty Income in the OfficeCo Sale Notice; provided, however, that no such sale shall occur (A) prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time or (B) prior to the Effective Time if such sale would reasonably be expected to cause VEREIT to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal Tax purposes.

Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that each of the Realty Income Expense Reimbursement, VEREIT Expense Reimbursement, Realty Income Termination Fee and VEREIT Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.   (f) The “VEREIT Termination Fee” shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the VEREIT Base Amount (as defined below) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to Realty Income without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the “REIT Requirements”) for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (b) Realty Income has 0.5% of its gross income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of Realty Income which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants to Realty Income. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Realty Income receives Tax Guidance providing that Realty Income’s receipt of the VEREIT Base Amount should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the VEREIT Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the VEREIT Base Amount and VEREIT shall, upon receiving notice that Realty Income has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Realty Income the unpaid VEREIT Base Amount within five (5) Business Days. In the event that Realty Income is not able to receive the full VEREIT Base Amount due to the above limitations, VEREIT shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three (3) days of the date when the VEREIT Termination Fee would otherwise be due but for the above limitations and shall not release any portion thereof to Realty Income unless and until Realty Income receives either one or a combination of the following once or more often: (i) a letter from Realty Income’s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Realty Income without causing Realty Income to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which events VEREIT shall pay to Realty Income the lesser of the unpaid VEREIT Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above within five (5) Business Days after VEREIT has been notified thereof. The obligation of VEREIT to pay any unpaid portion of the VEREIT Termination Fee shall terminate on the December31 following the date which is three (3) years from the date the VEREIT Termination Fee first becomes payable under Section 7.2(b). Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of VEREIT to pay the VEREIT Termination Fee terminates shall be released to VEREIT. “ Qualifying Income” shall mean income described in Sections856(c)(2)(A)–(I) and 856(c)(3)(A)–(I) of the Code. “ Tax Guidance” shall mean a reasoned opinion from nationally recognized federal income tax counsel experienced in REIT tax matters or a ruling from the IRS. The “VEREIT Base Amount” shall mean $365,000,000; provided, however, that, in the event the VEREIT Termination Fee becomes payable as a result of the termination of this Agreement prior to the Window Period End Time (a) by VEREIT pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) with respect to a Superior Proposal by a Qualified Bidder or (b) by Realty Income pursuant to Section 7.1(e) in response to a Change in VEREIT Recommendation effected in compliance with Section 5.4(b)(iv) with respect to a Superior Proposal by a Qualified Bidder, then, in the case of either of the immediately preceding clauses (a) or (b), the “VEREIT Base Amount” shall mean $195,000,000.   86

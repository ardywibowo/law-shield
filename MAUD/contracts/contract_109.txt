B. At a date and time following the Holdco Merger as determined by Parent, People’s United Bank, National Association, a national banking association and Subsidiary of the Company (“Company Bank”) will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Bank Merger Agreement, merge with and into Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, a New York state chartered bank and Subsidiary of Parent (“Parent Bank”) (the “Bank Merger”), so that Parent Bank is the surviving bank in the Bank Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Bank”). 


C. In furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub have approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and have resolved to submit this Agreement to their respective shareholders and stockholders, as applicable, for approval and to recommend that their respective shareholders and stockholders, as applicable, approve this Agreement. 


D. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and the Holdco Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 


E. In this Agreement, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe certain conditions to the transactions contemplated hereby.

number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to give Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 


(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company or Parent (in each case, other than shares of Company Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or Parent in respect of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Parent Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(a) At and after the Effective Time, each share of Parent Common Stock and each share of preferred stock of Parent, par value $1.00 per share (“Parent Preferred Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock or preferred stock, as applicable, of Parent and shall not be affected by the Merger. 


(b) At and after the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share (“Merger Sub Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be converted into and become one share of common stock, no par value, of the Interim Surviving Entity.

unit denominated in shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into a restricted share unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (a “Parent Stock-Based RSU”). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Stock-Based RSU shall be equal to the product (rounded up or down to the nearest whole number, with 0.5 rounding up) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Share immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable dividend equivalents) based on the higher of target performance and actual performance through the Effective Time as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the Company Board (the “Company Compensation Committee”) in its reasonable judgment and in consultation with Parent, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above or in Section 1.8(d) below, at and following the Effective Time, each such Parent Stock-Based RSU shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including employment vesting terms but excluding performance conditions, after giving effect to any “change in control” post-termination protections under the applicable Company Stock Plan or award agreement) as were applicable to the applicable Company Performance Share immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Except as specifically provided above, in Section 1.8(d) below or in Section 1.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, following the Effective Time, each Company Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms, after giving effect to any “change in control” post-termination protections under the applicable Company Stock Plan or award agreement) as were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Parent 2019 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Parent Equity Plan”)) following the Closing, any then-outstanding Parent Converted Equity Award, to the extent not then vested, shall be treated in accordance with Section 10.1 of the Parent Equity Plan.

Certificates in exchange for New Certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or shares of New Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) (A) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and (B) a check representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and (y) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), or (ii) (A) a New Certificate representing that number of shares of New Parent Preferred Stock to which such holder of Company Preferred Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and (B) a check representing the amount of any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock or shares of New Parent Preferred Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2. 


(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock or New Parent Preferred Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock or shares of New Parent Preferred Stock that the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive. 


(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock or New Parent Preferred Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock or New Parent Preferred Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock or New Parent Preferred Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2, as applicable.

to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the consecutive period of five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. 


(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity. Any former holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of the shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, or the shares of New Parent Preferred Stock and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the New Parent Preferred Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Preferred Stock such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 


(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 


(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, or the shares of New Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable, and dividends or distributions, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

3.1 Corporate Organization. 


(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the BHC Act. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability (including the Pandemic Measures) to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries (including any such changes arising out of the Pandemic or any Pandemic Measures), (D) changes, after the date hereof, resulting from hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, floods or other natural disasters or from any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak of any disease or other public health event (including the Pandemic), (E) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on a party’s relationships with its customers or employees) (it being understood that the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.3(b), 3.4, 4.3(b) or 4.4) or actions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) a decline in the trading price of a party’s common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts (it being understood that the underlying causes of such decline or failure may be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred); except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as   -9-

promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger, the Holdco Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to obtaining all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; and provided, that each party shall promptly advise the other party with respect to substantive matters that are addressed in any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with or affecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which the other party does not attend or participate in, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and subject to applicable law and Section 9.15. As used in this Agreement, the term “Requisite Regulatory Approvals” shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders and approvals (and the expiration or termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof), or waivers of such regulatory authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, (i) from the Federal Reserve Board (in respect of the Merger, the Holdco Merger and the Bank Merger), the NYDFS and the CDB, or (ii) referred to in Section 3.4 or Section 4.4 that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger, the Holdco Merger and the Bank Merger), except for any such authorizations, consents, orders or approvals the failure of which to be obtained would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Entity. 


(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (without the prior written consent of Parent), to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (a “Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition”).

(f) Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.1, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the furnishing of information and by making employees reasonably available) as is reasonably requested by Parent in order to comply with the requirements of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing programs. 


6.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality. 


(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws (including the Pandemic Measures), each of Parent and the Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time the conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose in accordance with Section 9.15 or otherwise under applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Parent’s or the Company’s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or to the extent that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, reasonably determines, in light of the Pandemic and the Pandemic Measures, that such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any of its employees. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 


(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party’s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated January 25, 2021, between Parent and the Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”). 


(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth in this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations. 


6.3 Shareholders’ Approval and Stockholder Approval. 


(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders and stockholders, respectively (the “Parent Meeting” and the “Company Meeting,” respectively) as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, for the purpose of obtaining (i) the Requisite Parent Vote and the Requisite Company Vote, respectively, required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) if so desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, in connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable   -48-

best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date and to set the same record date for such meetings. Such meetings may be held virtually, subject to applicable law and the organizational documents of each party. 


(b) Subject to Section 6.3(c), (i) each of Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Parent and the stockholders of the Company, respectively, the Requisite Parent Vote and the Requisite Company Vote, respectively, including by communicating to the respective shareholders of Parent and stockholders of the Company its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that, in the case of Parent, the shareholders of Parent approve and adopt the Parent Charter Amendment and the Parent Share Issuance (the “Parent Board Recommendation”), and in the case of the Company, that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement (the “Company Board Recommendation”); and (ii) each of Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall not (A) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the other party the Parent Board Recommendation, in the case of Parent, or the Company Board Recommendation, in the case of the Company, (B) fail to make the Parent Board Recommendation, in the case of Parent, or the Company Board Recommendation, in the case of the Company, in the Joint Proxy Statement, (C) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (D) fail to publicly and without qualification (1) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal, or (2) reaffirm the Parent Board Recommendation, in the case of Parent, or the Company Board Recommendation, in the case of the Company, in each case, within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting, as applicable) after an Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by the other party to do so, or (E) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing, a “Recommendation Change”). 


(c) Subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Parent or the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its outside financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the Parent Board Recommendation or the Company Board Recommendation, as applicable, such Board of Directors may, in the case of Parent, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, and in the case of Company, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, submit this Agreement to its shareholders or stockholders, respectively, without recommendation (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall constitute a Recommendation Change) (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event such Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided, that such Board of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless it (i) gives the other party at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including in the event such action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances); and (ii) at the end of such notice period, takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its outside financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the Parent Board Recommendation or the Company Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3(c) and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3(c). 


(d) Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by   -49-

6.6 Employee Matters. 


(a) Commencing on the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2022, unless otherwise mutually determined by the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who at the Effective Time become employees of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries (the “Continuing Employees”) (i) base salary or base wage that is no less than the base salary or base wage provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus opportunities provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits (other than severance and equity- based incentive opportunities) that are comparable to those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company agree that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof,   -50-

Parent shall provide severance payments and benefits as described in Section 6.6(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Continuing Employee who is involuntarily terminated during such period.

(c) Parent agrees that, with respect to the annual bonus plans set forth on Section 6.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the “Annual Incentive Plans”), it shall provide each Continuing Employee who participates in an Annual Incentive Plan (an “Incentive Plan Participant”) with a normal and customary annual cash incentive award for the year during which the Closing occurs determined as the sum of (i) a pro-rated portion of the bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to the Closing, which bonus shall be determined based upon actual performance through the Closing Date, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Company prior to the Closing; provided that such amounts have been accrued in the Company’s internal financial records consistent with past practice plus (ii) a pro-rated portion of the bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that occurs after the Closing determined by Parent and in accordance with Section 6.6(a)(ii) above. Such amounts shall be paid at the time Annual Incentive Plan payments would typically be paid so long as an Incentive Plan Participant remains employed through the relevant payment date; provided that Parent will provide any Incentive Plan Participant who experiences a termination of employment on or after the Closing due to death, disability (as defined in the Company’s long-term disability plan), an involuntary termination without cause, or, if applicable, by the Incentive Plan Participant for good reason, with respect to which the Incentive Plan Participant is eligible to receive severance benefits under a Company Benefit Plan or a Parent Benefit Plan payment of the amount that would otherwise have been payable under this Section 6.6(c) pro-rated, as applicable, for the portion of the year of the Closing during which such Incentive Plan Participant was employed and provided further that in no event shall payment of any amounts under the Annual Incentive Plans pursuant to this Section 6.6(c) result in the duplication of payments to any Incentive Plan Participant under any Company Benefit Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall this Section 6.6(c) amend, modify or otherwise reduce any severance payments to which an Incentive Plan Participant is eligible to receive pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan that is calculated by reference to a multiple of a target or actual cash incentive bonus.

Parent and its Subsidiaries prior to the first payment: (x) 40% upon the Closing, (y) 30% upon the first anniversary of Closing and (z) 30% upon the second anniversary of Closing, in each case, subject to continued employment through such date (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the “net better” cutback provisions of the Change in Control Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such Change in Control Employee’s employment with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary terminates for any reason other than for Cause or as a result of a such Change in Control Employee’s resignation other than for Good Reason on or before the third anniversary of Closing, such Change in Control Employee shall be entitled to any then unpaid cash severance, and to the extent applicable, remain eligible to receive any other benefits (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any retirement and group health continuation benefits) in accordance with his or her Change in Control Agreement (subject to the release requirement described above). Prior to the Effective Time, in order to facilitate the foregoing, Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access to the Change in Control Employees. Prior to Parent providing a Revised Change in Control Agreement to any Change in Control Employee, Parent shall provide the Company with a draft form of Revised Change in Control Agreement, the form and substance of which shall be subject to the review and approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Parent shall deliver to the Company an executed copy of each Revised Change in Control Agreement as soon as practicable following its execution. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any such Change in Control Employee does not enter into a Revised Change in Control Agreement, such Change in Control Employee shall remain subject to his or her Change in Control Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof and failure to enter into a Revised Change in Control Agreement shall in no way affect the rights or benefits such Change in Control Employee has or may have under such Change in Control Agreement.

If Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by Parent) not later than two (2) days immediately preceding the Closing Date, and (ii) the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”), it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan for Continuing Employees. Parent and the Company shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or the Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) from the Company 401(k) Plan in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans), Parent Common Stock or a combination thereof in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such employee from the Company 401(k) Plan, and Parent shall endeavor through reasonably commercial efforts to ensure availability of in-kind and note rollover.

Similarly, on and after the date hereof, any broad-based employee notices or communication materials (including any website posting) to be provided or communicated by Parent with respect to employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and comment of the   -52-

Parent agrees that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a “change in control”, “change of control” or other similar concept under any Company Benefit Plan, and prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or the compensation committee thereof) shall be empowered to take such action as necessary to declare such status under such Company Benefit Plans.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.12, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Parent or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 


6.7 ESOP Matters. 


(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take any and all actions and adopt such necessary resolutions to terminate the ESOP effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date and adopt such amendments to the ESOP to terminate the ESOP and effectuate the provisions of this Section 6.7. The ESOP amendments shall provide that (i) all ESOP participant accounts shall be fully vested, (ii) no new participants will be admitted to the ESOP on or after the ESOP termination date, and (iii) no additional benefits shall accrue to any ESOP participant with respect to services performed on or after the Closing Date. The form and substance of all such resolutions and amendments shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the Company shall deliver to Parent an executed copy of the resolutions and amendments as soon as practicable following their adoption by the Board of Directors of the Company and shall fully comply with such resolutions and amendments. 


(b) In connection with the termination of the ESOP and the Merger, the Company shall cause all outstanding indebtedness of the ESOP (including any ESOP Loan) to be satisfied in full at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date. The Company will cancel or offset the ESOP Loan (including accrued interest thereon) in exchange for unallocated shares attributable to the ESOP Loan having an aggregate fair market value that is not more than the outstanding amount of the ESOP Loan plus accrued interest. This will result in the cancellation of both the loan receivable and payable on the books of the Company. Any remaining shares of Company Common Stock held by the ESOP trust after repayment of the ESOP Loan shall be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5 hereof, and the balance of the unallocated shares and any other unallocated assets remaining in the ESOP’s suspense account after satisfaction of the ESOP Loan and conversion of the shares of Company Common Stock into Parent Common Stock shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of the ESOP participants who are employed as of the date of termination of the ESOP   -53-

based on their account balances under the ESOP as of such date. For the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence shall have no effect if there are no such unallocated shares or any other unallocated assets remaining in the ESOP’s suspense account. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent documentary evidence sufficient to show that all outstanding indebtedness of the Company ESOP (including any ESOP Loan) has been satisfied in full. 


(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall file or cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the ESOP. As soon as practicable following the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in ESOP shall either be distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct. Prior to the distribution of account balances in the ESOP, Parent shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the Parent 401(k) Plan to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) at the time of such distribution from the ESOP in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing Employee from the ESOP to the Parent 401(k) Plan. 


6.8 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. 


(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall indemnify and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and the governing or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Company Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses, any Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. The Surviving Entity shall reasonably cooperate with the Company Indemnified Parties, and the Company Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving Entity, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 


(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the Surviving Entity shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Entity’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of, Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year “tail” policy under the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to   -54-

that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap. 


(c) The obligations of the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Company under this Section 6.8 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.8 without the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person. 


(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in each such case, the Surviving Entity will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. 


6.9 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Entity with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the Holdco Merger or the Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent. 


6.10 Advice of Changes. Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise the other party of any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it, or (ii) that it believes would or would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.10 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. 


6.11 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement and to the extent permitted under the Parent Charter and the Company Charter, respectively, each of Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of the Parent Common Stock, Parent Preferred Stock, Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of the Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock and any shares of the Parent Common Stock or New Parent Preferred Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 


6.12 Shareholder Litigation. Each party shall give the other party prompt notice in writing of any shareholder litigation against such party or its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parent’s expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation. Each party shall give the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by such party in connection with any such litigation, and will   -55-

in good faith take such comments into account. The Company shall not agree to settle any such litigation without Parent’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of Parent and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the Effective Time upon the Surviving Entity or any of its affiliates. 


6.13 Corporate Governance.

Such members of the Advisory Board will serve on the Advisory Board until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date or until their respective earlier death or resignation, during which period such members will each receive annual compensation of $40,000. 


6.14 Headquarters; Commitments to Communities. 


(a) As of the Effective Time, Bridgeport, Connecticut shall become Parent’s New England headquarters and Parent shall retain the Company’s headquarters building in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

(c) At or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall contribute $25,000,000 to establish a new charitable foundation dedicated to supporting community development and reinvestment, and civic and charitable activities primarily in the greater Bridgeport, Connecticut area and such other areas as the Company and Parent may mutually agree. 


6.15 Acquisition Proposals. 


(a) Each party agrees that it will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) to, immediately cease, and cause to be terminated, any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than the Company, in the case of Parent, or Parent, in the case of the Company, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 


(b) Each party agrees that it will not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person   -56-

relating to any Acquisition Proposal (except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of such party, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.15), or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 6.15) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 


(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.15(a) and 6.15(b), in the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, or the Requisite Company Vote, in the case of the Company, a party receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions with the person making the Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its outside financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that, prior to furnishing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, such party shall have provided such information to the other party to this Agreement and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement (“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”), which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with such party.

Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.

such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 


6.16 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent agree that the initial press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a release mutually agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the parties agrees that no public release or announcement or statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental Entity or stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, or (b) for such releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with other such releases, announcement or statements made after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this Section 6.16. 


6.17 Change of Method. Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the combination of Company and Parent (including the provisions of Article I), and, if and to the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall agree to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall (a) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (b) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to the Company’s stockholders, or (c) materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 9.1. 


6.18 Restructuring Efforts. If either the Company or Parent shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions provided for in this Agreement (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of the Company as provided for in this Agreement, or any term that would adversely affect the Tax treatment of the transactions contemplated hereby, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable) and/or resubmit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.18) to its respective shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, for approval. 


6.19 Takeover Restrictions. None of the Company, Parent or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Restriction to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Restriction now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Restriction may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Restriction on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Restriction.

under the definitive documents governing the indebtedness set forth on Section 6.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on, the notes governed thereby. In connection therewith, prior to the Effective Time or the Bank Merger Effective Time, as applicable, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause Parent Bank and Company Bank, respectively, to, cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to (a) execute and deliver any supplemental indentures, officer’s certificates or other documents, and (b) provide any opinion of counsel to the trustee thereof, in each case, required to make such assumption effective as of the Effective Time or the Bank Merger Effective Time, as applicable. 


6.21 Amendment of Parent Charter. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Requisite Parent Vote, Parent shall amend the Parent Charter to effect (i) an increase in the number of authorized shares of Parent’s stock from 251,000,000 to 270,000,000 and (ii) an increase in the number of authorized shares of preferred stock from 1,000,000 to 20,000,000 (the “Parent Charter Amendment”). 


6.22 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). The Company and Parent agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the “Company Insiders”), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of the Company Common Stock, the Company Preferred Stock and the Company Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.22. The Company shall deliver to Parent in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding the Company Insiders, and the Board of Directors of Parent and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of Company) any acquisitions and dispositions of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Company Equity Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the case of Parent) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock, New Parent Preferred Stock, or Parent Equity Awards by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 


6.23 Transition. Commencing on and following the date hereof, and in all cases subject to applicable Law, upon the reasonable request of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Parent and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the integration of the parties and their respective businesses effective as of the Closing Date or such later date as may be determined by Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, and consistent with the performance of their day-to-day operations and the continuous operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, and subject to any requirements under applicable law, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the employees and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide Parent assistance, upon the reasonable request of Parent, with respect to conversion planning and customer communications and notices (including joint communications and notices relating to anticipated account changes or systems conversion) provided, however, that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to terminate any third-party service provider arrangements prior to the Closing .   -59-

representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or the Surviving Entity.

All other representations and warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement (read without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties but, in each case, after giving effect to the lead-in to Article IV) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date); provided, however, that for purposes of this sentence, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The Company shall have received a certificate dated as of the Closing Date and signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to the foregoing effect.

ARTICLE VIII 


TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT 


8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote: 


(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; 


(b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger, the Holdco Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint or prohibition permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger, the Holdco Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 


(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the “Termination Date”), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 


(d) by either Parent or the Company (provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written notice to Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date); 


(e) by the Company, if (i) Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent shall have made a Recommendation Change, or (ii) Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent shall have breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.15 in any material respect; or 


(f) by Parent, if (i) the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company shall have made a Recommendation Change, or (ii) the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company shall have breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.15 in any material respect.   -62-

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses (b) through (f) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected. 


8.2 Effect of Termination. 


(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 6.16 (Public Announcements), this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.13) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or its Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement. “Willful Breach” shall mean a material breach of, or material failure to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in, this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching or non-performing party with actual knowledge that such party’s act or failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in or constitute such breach of or such failure of performance under this Agreement. 


(b) (i) In the event that (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the Company Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal, in each case, with respect to the Company, and (B) (x) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 were satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination), or (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a Willful Breach, and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to two hundred and eighty million dollars ($280,000,000) (the “Termination Fee”); provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “twenty-five percent (25%)” shall instead refer to “fifty percent (50%).” 


(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of termination. 


(c) (i) In the event that (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of Parent or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of Parent generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the Parent Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal, in each case, with respect to Parent, and (B) (x) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Parent Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 were satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination), or (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a Willful Breach, and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Parent enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred   -63-

to above), then Parent shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay the Company the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds; provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(c)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “twenty-five percent (25%)” shall instead refer to “fifty percent (50%).” 


(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then Parent shall pay the Company, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of termination. 


(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other party’s fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement, in no event shall either party be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once. 


(e) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or the Company, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Parent or the Company, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” published in the Wall Street Journal on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full. The amounts payable by the Company and Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c), respectively, and this Section 8.2(e), constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the other party in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such applicable section.

CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF M&T BANK CORPORATION 


Under Section 805 of the Business Corporation Law 


The undersigned, being the [ ] and [ ] of M&T Bank Corporation (the “Corporation”), do hereby certify and set forth as follows: 


(1) The name of the Corporation is M&T BANK CORPORATION. The name under which the Corporation was formed is First Empire State Corporation. 


(2) The certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed by the Department of State on the 6th day of November, 1969. 


(3) The board of directors of the Corporation (the “Board of Directors”) or a duly authorized committee thereof, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation and applicable law, adopted resolutions on the [ ] of [ ], 2021, creating a series of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock of the Corporation designated as “Perpetual Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series H.” 


(4) The certificate of incorporation is hereby amended by adding language to Article FOURTH, which recites the terms and conditions of the Perpetual Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series H, as follows: 


11. A series of preferred stock of the Corporation be and hereby is created, and the designation of such series, the number of shares to comprise such series, the dividend rate or rates payable with respect to the shares of such series, the redemption price, the voting rights, and any other relative rights, preferences and limitations pertaining to such series, are as follows: 


1. Designation and Amount. The series of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, shall be designated as the “Perpetual Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series H” (the “Series H Preferred Stock”). The Series H Preferred Stock shall be perpetual, subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, and the authorized number of shares of the Series H Preferred Stock shall be 10,000,000 shares. The number of shares of Series H Preferred Stock may be increased from time to time pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 hereof and any such additional shares of Series H Preferred Stock shall form a single series with the Series H Preferred Stock. Each share of Series H Preferred Stock shall have the same designations, powers, preferences and rights as every other share of Series H Preferred Stock. 


2. Dividends. 


1. Holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under New York law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series H Preferred Stock at a rate equal to (i) 5.625% per annum for each Dividend Period (as defined below) from [ ], the original issue date of the Series H Preferred Stock (the “Issue Date”) to, but excluding, December 15, 2026 (the “Fixed Rate Period”) and (ii) three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.02% per annum for each Dividend Period from and including December 15, 2026 (the “Floating Rate Period”). If the Corporation issues additional shares of Series H Preferred Stock after the Issue Date, dividends on such additional shares of Series H Preferred Stock may accumulate from and including the Issue Date, the then most recent Dividend Payment Date or any other date the Corporation specifies at the time such additional shares of Series H Preferred Stock are issued. 


The dividend rate for each Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent using three-month LIBOR as in effect on the second London banking day prior to the   A-2

beginning of the Dividend Period, which date is the “Dividend Determination Date” for the Dividend Period. The Calculation Agent then will add three-month LIBOR as determined on the Dividend Determination Date and the applicable spread of 4.02% per annum. Absent manifest error, the Calculation Agent’s determination of the dividend rate for each Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period for the Series H Preferred Stock will be binding and conclusive on holders of the Series H Preferred Stock, the transfer agent and the Corporation. “Calculation Agent” shall mean such bank or other entity as may be appointed by the Corporation to act as calculation agent for the Series H Preferred Stock during the Floating Rate Period. A “London banking day” shall mean any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. 


The term “three-month LIBOR” shall mean the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as that rate appears on Reuters screen page “LIBOR01” (or any successor or replacement page) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the relevant Dividend Determination Date. If no offered rate appears on Reuters screen page “LIBOR01” (or any successor or replacement page) on the relevant Dividend Determination Date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the Calculation Agent, in consultation with the Corporation, will select four major banks in the London interbank market and will request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, three-month LIBOR will be the arithmetic average (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the Calculation Agent, in consultation with the Corporation, will select three major banks in New York City and will request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by it at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Dividend Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable dividend period in an amount of at least $1,000,000, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If three quotations are provided, three-month LIBOR will be the arithmetic average (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the quotations provided. Otherwise, three-month LIBOR for the next Dividend Period will be equal to three- month LIBOR in effect for the then-current Dividend Period or, in the case of the first dividend Period in the Floating Rate Period, the most recent rate on which three-month LIBOR could have been determined in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph had the dividend rate been a floating rate during the Fixed Rate Period. 


A “Dividend Period” means the period from, and including, a Dividend Payment Date (as defined below) to, but excluding, the next Dividend Payment Date, except that the initial Dividend Period shall commence on and include [ ].1 


2. If declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, the Corporation shall pay dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock quarterly in arrears, on [March 15], [June 15], [September 15] and [December 15] of each year, beginning on [ ]2 (each such day on which dividends are payable, a “Dividend Payment Date”). In the event that any Dividend Payment Date during the Fixed Rate Period falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), then the dividend payment due on that date shall be due on the next day that is a Business Day and no additional dividends shall accrue as a result of that postponement. In the event that any Dividend Payment Date during the Floating Rate Period falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date will be the next day that is a Business Day. However, if the postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month during the Floating Rate Period, the Dividend Payment Date will instead be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day.   1 To reflect the last dividend payment date in respect of the Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A of People’s United Financial, Inc. prior to Closing. 2 To reflect the first dividend payment date following the Issue Date.   A-3

A “Business Day” means (i) with respect to the Fixed Rate Period, any day, other than a Saturday or a Sunday, that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City, New York, are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close and (ii) with respect to the Floating Rate Period, any day, other than a Saturday or a Sunday, that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City, New York, are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, and additionally, is a London banking day. 


3. Dividends shall be payable to holders of record of shares of the Series H Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the applicable record date, not exceeding 30 days before the applicable Dividend Payment Date, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors. 


4. Dividends payable on shares of the Series H Preferred Stock during the Fixed Rate Period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends payable on the Preferred Stock for the Floating Rate Period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in a Dividend Period and a 360-day year. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation shall be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. If the Corporation redeems the Series H Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6, dividends on shares of the Series H Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue on the redemption date, if any, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price of the Series H Preferred Stock called for redemption. No interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series H Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. 


5. Dividends on shares of the Series H Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative. If for any reason the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on the Series H Preferred Stock in respect of a Dividend Period, then no dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such Dividend Period or be payable on the applicable Dividend Payment Date, and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay any dividend for that Dividend Period, whether or not the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors declares a dividend on the Series H Preferred Stock for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to the Series H Preferred Stock or for any future dividend period with respect to any other series of preferred stock of the Corporation or common stock, par value $0.50 per share, of the Corporation (the “Common Stock”). 


6. So long as any share of the Series H Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series H Preferred Stock in respect of the most recently completed Dividend Period have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment:   


  


1. no dividend shall be declared or paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Junior Securities (as defined below) (other than (1) a dividend payable solely in Junior Securities or (2) any dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders’ rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under any such plan);   


  


2. no shares of Junior Securities shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation (other than (1) as a result of a reclassification of Junior Securities for or into other Junior Securities, (2) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Securities for or into another share of Junior Securities, (3) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Securities, (4) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Junior Securities in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (5) purchases of shares of Junior Securities pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy Junior Securities existing prior to such most recently completed Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (6) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Securities   A-4

3. no shares of Parity Securities (as defined below) shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Corporation (other than (1) pursuant to pro rata offers to purchase all, or a pro rata portion, of the Series H Preferred Stock and such Parity Securities, if any, (2) as a result of a reclassification of Parity Securities for or into other Parity Securities, (3) the exchange or conversion of Parity Securities for or into other Parity Securities or Junior Securities, (4) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Parity Securities, (5) purchases of shares of Parity Securities pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy Parity Securities existing prior to such most recently completed Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (6) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Parity Securities pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Parity Securities or the security being converted or exchanged, (7) purchases or other acquisitions by any of the Corporation’s broker-dealer subsidiaries solely for the purpose of market making, stabilization or customer facilitation transactions in Parity Securities in the ordinary course of business, (8) purchases by any of the Corporation’s broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Corporation’s capital stock for resale pursuant to an offering by the Corporation of such capital stock underwritten by such broker-dealer subsidiary, or (9) the acquisition by the Corporation or any of the Corporation’s subsidiaries of record ownership in Parity Securities for the beneficial ownership of any other persons (other than for the beneficial ownership by the Corporation or any of the Corporation’s subsidiaries), including as trustees or custodians); provided that for the avoidance of doubt, references to Parity Securities in this clause (iii) refer to any class or series of capital stock that ranks on a parity with the shares of Series H Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 


7. No dividends shall be declared or paid or funds set apart for the payment of dividends on any preferred stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series H Preferred Stock as to dividends, if any, for any period unless dividends on the shares of Series H Preferred Stock have been contemporaneously declared and paid or a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for such payment for the most recently completed Dividend Period. When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of Series H Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series H Preferred Stock as to dividends, if any, all dividends declared and paid upon the shares of the Series H Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Series H Preferred Stock as to dividends, if any, shall be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share shall bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share on Series H Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, if any, on such Parity Securities, if any, bear to each other. 


8. Subject to the conditions in this Section 2, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, capital stock, or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, may be declared and paid on Junior Securities or Parity   A-5

Securities, if any, from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in those dividends. 


9. Dividends on the Series H Preferred Stock shall not be declared, paid or funds set apart for the payment thereof to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, including applicable capital adequacy rules of any appropriate federal banking regulator or agency. 


10. The Series H Preferred Stock ranks on a parity with the Corporation’s Perpetual Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E (“Series E Preferred Stock”), Perpetual Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F (“Series F Preferred Stock”) and Perpetual 5.0% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series G (“Series G Preferred Stock”) in the payment of dividends. 


3. Liquidation Preference. 


1. Upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to its stockholders a liquidating distribution of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, before any payment or distribution of assets to the holders of the Common Stock or any other class or series of Junior Securities. Holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation and shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation after such holders have received their full liquidating distribution as provided for in this Section 3. 


2. In any such distribution, if the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid dividends in full to all holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and the liquidation amounts owed to all holders of Parity Securities, if any, the amounts paid to the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and the holders of Parity Securities, if any, shall be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions owed to those holders. If the liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of the Series H Preferred Stock and the liquidation amounts owed to all holders of Parity Securities, if any, have been paid in full to all such holders, the holders of Junior Securities shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and preferences. 


3. For purposes of this Section 3, the merger or consolidation by the Corporation with or into any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Corporation for cash, securities or other consideration, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 


4. The Series H Preferred Stock ranks on a parity with the Corporation’s Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 


4. Preemption and Conversion. The holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall not have any preemptive rights with respect to any shares of the Corporation’s capital stock or any of its other securities convertible into or carrying rights or options to purchase any such capital stock. The holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such shares into shares of any other class or series of securities of the Corporation. 


5. Voting Rights. 


1. The holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall have no voting power and no right to vote on any matter at any time, either as a separate series or class or together with any other series or class of shares of capital stock, and shall not be entitled to call a meeting of such holders for any purpose nor   A-6

shall they be entitled to participate in any meeting of the holders of the Common Stock, except as provided in this Section 5 or as otherwise specifically required by law. 


2. So long as any shares of Series H Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of all outstanding shares of the Series H Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Stock, voting together as a separate class of the Corporation’s capital stock, shall be required to authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or create shares of, any class or series of Senior Securities, or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of Senior Securities. 


3. So long as any shares of the Series H Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of all outstanding shares of the Series H Preferred Stock, voting together as a separate class of the Corporation’s capital stock, shall be required to:   


  


1. amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Designations or the Certificate of Incorporation so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series H Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series H Preferred Stock or authorized Common Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase or decrease in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series H Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series H Preferred Stock; or   


  


2. consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification involving the Series H Preferred Stock, or a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another entity unless (i) the shares of the Series H Preferred Stock remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the new surviving entity and (ii) the shares of the remaining Series H Preferred Stock or new preferred securities have terms that are not materially less favorable than the Series H Preferred Stock. 


4. If the Corporation fails to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on outstanding shares of the Series H Preferred Stock for six or more quarterly Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall be increased by two at the Corporation’s first annual meeting of the stockholders held thereafter, and at such meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting until continuous noncumulative dividends for at least one year on all outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock entitled thereto shall have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment, in full, the holders of Series H Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class together with holders of any other equally ranked series of preferred stock that have similar voting rights, if any (such stock, “Voting Parity Stock”), to elect such two additional members of the Board of Directors (such additional directors, the “Preferred Directors”) to hold office for a term of one year; provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Directors. Upon such payment, or such declaration and setting apart for payment, in full, the terms of the Preferred Directors shall forthwith terminate, and the number of directors shall be reduced by two, and such voting right of the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock shall cease, subject to increase in the number of directors as described in this clause (d) and to revesting of such voting right in the event of each and every additional failure in the payment of dividends for six quarterly Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, as described in this clause (d). 


5. Any Preferred Director may be removed and replaced at any time, with cause as provided by law or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of the Series H Preferred Stock voting together as a class with the holders of Voting Parity Stock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described in clause (d) above are then exercisable. Any vacancy created by removal with or   A-7

without cause may be filled only as described in the preceding sentence. If the office of any Preferred Director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal, the remaining Preferred Director may choose a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. In addition, if and when the rights of holders of Series H Preferred Stock terminate for any reason, including under circumstances described in Section 6, such voting rights shall terminate along with the other rights (except, if applicable, the right to receive the redemption price plus any declared and unpaid dividends as provided for in Section 6), and the terms of any Preferred Directors shall terminate automatically and the number of directors reduced by two, assuming that the rights of holders of Voting Parity Stock have similarly terminated.

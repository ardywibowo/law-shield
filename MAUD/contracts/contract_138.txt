Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company, Parent,








________________


Merger Sub or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.04, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $17.25 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.   (b)   Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.   (c)   Each share of Company Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Excluded Company Person immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of common shares of the Surviving Corporation such that the shares issued in respect thereof to each such Person represent the same percentage of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Person owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (d)   Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and, together with the shares referenced in clause (c) above, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”) or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”). The Exchange Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Exchange Agreement shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares represented by such Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Such funds may be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided that such funds shall only be invested in the manner provided in the Exchange Agent Agreement, and no   13       such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration, and to the extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than two Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent and finalized prior to the Effective Time and which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange (the “Letter of Transmittal”). The Company shall prepare in good faith and provide to Parent no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail its good faith estimate of the total unrestricted cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the “Estimated Closing Date Cash”). At Closing, the Company shall wire to the Exchange Agent an amount of cash specified by the Parent (“Company Cash”), the proceeds of which will be used by the Exchange Agent to pay a portion of the Merger Consideration. At least one day prior to the Closing, the Parent shall deliver to the Company written notice of the amount of Company Cash to be wired to the Exchange Agent and appropriate wire instructions. The Company Cash shall not be greater than the amount of the Estimated Closing Date Cash.   (b)   Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each share of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.   (c)   If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or   14       Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.   (e)   Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock without any interest thereon.   (f)   None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02, without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice and a copy of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to a holder’s rights of appraisal. Parent shall have the right to lead all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.   Section 2.05. Treatment of Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit payable upon settlement in Company Common Stock (or the intrinsic value of which is determined by reference to the value of Company Common Stock) granted under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company RSU”) shall become fully vested and shall be automatically canceled as of the Effective Time and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive, immediately after the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.05(c), a cash payment, without interest, in   15       an amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU (and then adding, if applicable, the value of any dividend-equivalent rights accrued with respect to such Company RSU as of the Effective Time); provided that any Company RSU that constitutes “deferred compensation” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code shall be settled in accordance with its terms and at a time that would not result in the application of additional Taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code.   (b)   At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company Option”) shall become fully vested and shall be automatically canceled as of the Closing Date and converted into the right of each holder of a Company Option that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is less than the Merger Consideration to receive, immediately after the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.05(c), a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the applicable exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable in respect of such fully vested Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Option that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall automatically be forfeited and cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment of any consideration and shall have no further force or effect.   (c)   Subject to Section 2.05, all payments under this Section 2.05 shall be made at or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) calendar days following the Effective Time), pursuant to the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.   (d)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors and the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, as applicable, shall provide any notice required under the Company Stock Plan, obtain any necessary consents, adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company Stock Plan or any outstanding awards granted thereunder and take all other actions required to give effect to the transactions contemplated in this Section 2.05.   Section 2.06. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any settlement of Company RSUs or exercise of Company Options, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 2.06 shall be deemed to permit the Company to take, or suffer to be taken, any of the aforementioned actions in violation of its obligations herein, including as set forth in Section 6.01.   16       Section 2.07. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.   Section 2.08. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 or any other payments pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law or under any other Applicable Law. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts and pays them over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.   Section 2.09. Tax Treatment. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income Tax purposes the transfer by the Company to the Exchange Agent of the Company Cash and use of the Company Cash as part of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger shall be treated as a sale or exchange of the applicable portion of the Company Common Stock that corresponds to the Company Cash pursuant to Zenz v. Quinlivan, 213 F.2D 917 (6th Cir. 1954) unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.   ARTICLE 3 THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   Section 3.01. Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to Section 7.03(c), at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that references therein to the name of Merger Sub shall instead refer to “Tribune

From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with Applicable Law, (a) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE 4 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document filed at least 2 Business Days before the date of this Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules thereto, but excluding (i) any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any “risk factors” section, (ii) any disclosures in any “forward-looking statements” section and (iii) any other statements that are similarly predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature; it being understood that nothing disclosed in any Company SEC Document shall be deemed to be a qualification of or modification to the representations and warranties in Section 4.01, Section 4.02, Section 4.05 or Section 4.06) or, subject to Section 11.05, as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent that:   Section 4.01.

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest with respect to an   48       Acquisition Proposal (provided that neither the Company nor the Board of Directors (nor any committee thereof) may recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless permitted by this Section 6.04(b)(ii) and even if permitted by the foregoing, is subject to the rights of Parent set forth in this Agreement), (B) issuing a “stop, look and listen” disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act or (C) contacting any Person or group and their respective Representatives who has made an offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited, facilitated or encouraged in violation or breach of this Section 6.04, and engaging in discussions therewith to the extent required to clarify such offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest and the terms thereof.

For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not in any way permit the Company to entertain or engage in discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal following the Company Stockholder Approval.   (d)   Last Look. Neither the Board of Directors nor the Company shall take any of the actions referred to in Section 6.04(b)(ii) unless (i) the Company shall have notified Parent, in writing and at least four Business Days prior to taking such action (the “Notice Period”), of its intention to take such action, specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the Adverse Recommendation Change and attaching a copy of any proposed agreements for the Superior Proposal, if applicable, (ii) during the Notice Period, the Company negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Board of Directors to maintain the Company Recommendation and not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement; and (iii) following the expiration of the Notice Period, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, taking into account any amendments to the terms hereof proposed by Parent, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided, however, that in the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material terms of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.04(d) with respect to such new written notice (it being understood that the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be two Business Days).   49       (e)   Obligation to Terminate Discussions. Subject to the remainder of this Section 6.04, the Company (i) shall, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) shall promptly request that all copies of all confidential information that the Company or any of its Representatives have distributed or made available to any such Third Party in connection with their consideration of any Acquisition Proposal in the year prior to the date hereof (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Third Party that contains, reflects or analyzes that information) be promptly destroyed or returned, and cause any physical or virtual data room to no longer be accessible to or by any such Third Party.

(d) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this ​Section 6.06 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses actually suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this ​Section 6.06 (including, in the case of ​Section 6.06(a), the Debt Financing contemplated thereby) and any information used in connection therewith, except to the extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses result from the gross negligence, actual fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives.   (e)   All non-public information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives or any other Person pursuant to Section 6.06(a) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement or, in the case of any such information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any other Person, a customary confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company, except that Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information to the Debt Financing sources, other potential sources of capital, rating agencies and prospective lenders (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not prospective investors in any debt or equity securities offering) during syndication of the Debt Financing subject to the potential sources of capital, ratings agencies and prospective lenders entering into customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information (including through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily used in confidential information memoranda for senior credit facilities).   54

   (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have complied with their obligations under this Section 6.06 for all purposes of this Agreement (including Article 10) except in the case of the Company’s Willful Breach of its obligations under this Section 6.06.     ARTICLE 7 COVENANTS OF PARENT   Parent agrees that:   Section 7.01. Conduct of Parent. Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, take any action or fail to take any action that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the financing thereof.   Section 7.02. Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.   Section 7.03. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:   (a)   For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors; officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any individuals serving in such capacity at or with respect to other Persons at the Company’s or its Subsidiaries request (each, an “Indemnified Person”) from and against any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in respect of the Indemnified Person’s having served in such capacity prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof. If any Indemnified Person is made party to any Legal Action arising out of or relating to matters that would be indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to, advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such Legal Action; provided that the Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides a customary undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in a final judicial determination that such Person was not entitled to be so indemnified.   (b)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their respective   55       obligations under any indemnification agreement with any Indemnified Person set forth on Section 7.03(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner that would adversely effect any right of any Indemnified Person thereunder.   (c)   For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained, and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, provisions in the Surviving Corporation’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.   (d)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and the Company’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, “D&O Insurance”), which D&O Insurance shall (i) be for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time; (ii) be from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance and (iii) have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against an Indemnified Person by reason of his or her having served in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the D&O Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Company’s current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Company’s current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the annual premium for such D&O Insurance shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company to maintain its existing directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance policies, which amount is set forth in Section 7.03(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided further that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Company or the   56       Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.   (e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)   consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any

Person or consummates any division transaction, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.03.   (f)   The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and their respective heirs and representatives.   Section 7.04. Employee Matters.   (a)   At the Effective Time, each Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who thereafter continues to provide services to Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (each, a “Continuing Employee”) shall receive from Parent or Surviving Corporation an annual rate of salary or wages, as applicable, that is not substantially less favorable than the annual rate of salary or wages provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (b)  As of the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any of its respective Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, to waive all limitations as to any pre-existing condition or waiting periods in its applicable welfare plans with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing Employee under any welfare plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time and to credit each Continuing Employee for any copayments, deductibles, offsets or similar payments made under any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the plan year (which includes the Effective Time) for purposes of satisfying any applicable copayment, deductible, offset or similar requirements under the comparable plans of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries. In addition, as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any applicable Subsidiary to, give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, accruals and determination of level of benefits under any employee benefit and compensation plans or arrangements (other than any qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension arrangements) maintained by Parent, Merger Sub or an applicable Subsidiary that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time for such Continuing Employees’ service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any comparable employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.04 shall be construed to require crediting of service that would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period.     57         (c)  Notwithstanding anything provided in this Section 7.04, each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be provided with compensation, benefits and terms and conditions of employment consistent with the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect.   (d)  If the Closing occurs before the date annual bonuses for fiscal year 2021 are paid under any Company Plan that is an annual cash incentive compensation plan or arrangement (each, a “2021 Bonus Plan”), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any of its respective Subsidiaries to (i) continue to operate such 2021 Bonus Plan in good faith, (ii) determine the amounts of annual bonuses for 2021 to be paid under the 2021 Bonus (together, the “Earned Bonuses”) reasonably, in good faith and in a manner that is consistent in all material respects with the terms of the applicable 2021 Bonus Plan and (iii) pay Earned Bonuses in accordance with the terms of such 2021 Bonus Plan. Any Company Employee who participates in a 2021 Bonus Plan and experiences a termination of employment without “cause” or a term of similar import at any time on or after the date hereof and on or prior to the Company’s 2021 fiscal year end shall be entitled, in addition to any other severance protections and benefits to which such Company Employee may be entitled, to receive a portion of his or her target 2021 annual bonus, pro-rated for the number of days elapsed during fiscal year 2021 through such Company Employee’s employment termination date, to be paid at the same time as such annual bonus would otherwise be paid to similarly situated Company Employees, subject in every case, to the attainment of the target level of performance by the Company or its applicable Subsidiary to which such bonus is subject for the fiscal year 2021 performance period (provided that such target level shall be equitably adjusted for any asset sale (including the Baltimore Sun Sale) effected during fiscal year 2021).    (e)  Without limiting the generality of ​Section 11.06, the provisions of this ​Section 7.04 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former Company Service Provider or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Section 7.04. Nothing herein shall be deemed to establish, amend or modify any Company Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates and nothing herein shall prohibit Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date.    Section 7.05. Parent Voting Agreement. (a) At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to any of the following, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of the Company with respect to any of the following, Parent hereby   58       irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to be present (in person or by proxy) and vote (or cause to be voted), or, with respect to any written consent solicitation, deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent with respect to, all of the shares of Company Securities or Company Subsidiary Securities owned beneficially or of record, directly or indirectly (including pursuant to derivative Contracts), by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or which any such Person has the right to acquire (collectively, the “Subject Securities”): (i) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and any related proposal in furtherance thereof, (ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone any such meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt this Agreement and/or if there are not sufficient shares present in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum, or as otherwise proposed by the Company and (iii) in favor of any other matter necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement. Parent shall provide the Company with at least five Business Days’ written notice prior to signing any action proposed to be taken by written consent with respect to any Subject Securities.   (b)   In the event of a failure by Parent to act in accordance with its obligations pursuant to Section 7.04(a), Parent hereby irrevocably grants to and appoints each officer of the Company (and any designee thereof) as Parent’s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution and resubstitution), for and in the name, place and stead of Parent, to (i) represent the Subject Securities and (ii) vote, execute and deliver written consents and otherwise act (by voting at any meeting of stockholders of the Company, written consent or otherwise) with respect to the Subject Securities, in each case, regarding the matters referred to in

Section 7.04(a) until the Effective Time, to the same extent and with the same effect as Parent could do under Applicable Law. Parent intends the proxy granted pursuant to this Section 7.05(b) to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by Parent with respect to the Subject Securities. Parent hereby ratifies and confirms all actions that the proxy appointed hereunder may lawfully do or cause to be done in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this proxy shall automatically be revoked at the Effective Time. The Company may terminate this proxy with respect to Parent at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to Parent. The parties acknowledge and agree that neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, directors or officers, shall owe any duty (fiduciary or otherwise), or incur any liability of any kind to Parent or any of its Affiliates, in connection with or as a result of the proper exercise of the powers granted to the officers of the Company by this Section 7.05(b).   (c)   Parent covenants and agrees that, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, it will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) transfer, assign, sell, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of (whether by merger, by tendering into any tender or exchange offer, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise) or consent to any of the foregoing (“Transfer”), or cause to be Transferred, any of the Subject Securities; (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney, or any other authorization or consent with respect to any or all of its Subject Securities in respect of any matter addressed by this Agreement; (iii) deposit any of the Subject Securities into a voting trust or enter into a   59       voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any of the Subject Securities or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with this Agreement, (iv) enter into any Contract with respect to the Transfer of any Subject Securities; or (v) take any other action, that would restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of Parent’s obligations hereunder. Any purported Transfer of the Subject Securities in violation of this Section 7.05(c) shall be null and void ab initio.   ARTICLE 8 COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY   The parties hereto agree that:   Section 8.01. Regulatory Undertakings; Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any actions taken by the Company permitted by Section 6.02 or Section 6.04), the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by causing their Affiliates to take), subject to Section 8.01(c), all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable (and in any event prior to the End Date), including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority or other Third Party all documentation to effect all necessary, proper or advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable.   (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall make, or cause its ultimate parent entity (within the meaning of the HSR Act) to make, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10 Business Days after the date hereof and any other required filings pursuant to applicable Competition Laws as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and furnish to the other party as promptly as practicable all information within its (or its Affiliates’) control requested by such other party and required for such other party to make any application or other filing to be made by it pursuant to any Applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Laws and shall promptly take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Competition Laws as promptly as practicable, and (ii) not enter into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Authority not to   60       consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.   (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Applicable Law (including any Competition Law), or if any Legal Action is instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or any other Applicable Law (including any Competition Law), the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve such objections. Parent shall direct and control the Parties’ efforts and strategy to resolve any such objections. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, (i) take all reasonable actions, including (A) agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of the businesses or properties or assets of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (B) terminating any existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (C) terminating any venture or other arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (D) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the actions described in the foregoing clauses (a)-(d) being “Divestiture Actions”) and (ii) not take any action if such action would reasonably be expected to make it more likely that there would arise any material impediments under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation law that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Authority to the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable. In no event shall Parent be required to take any such Divestiture Actions with respect to its businesses, properties, assets, Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than, following the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries), including agreeing to divest such entities or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services, or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to undertake any Divestiture Actions with respect to businesses, assets, or properties of the Company that, directly or indirectly, would materially impair the benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby that are reasonably expected to be enjoyed by Parent; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary herein, Parent shall be required to undertake Divestiture Actions with respect to businesses, assets or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries that account for up to $40 million of revenue for the fiscal year ended on December 27, 2020. The parties shall oppose, fully and vigorously, (1) any administrative or judicial Legal Action that is initiated or threatened to be initiated challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (2) any request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any order that could restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including in the case of either (c) or (c) by defending through litigation any action asserted by any Person in any court or before any

61       Governmental Authority, and vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.   (d) Each party shall (i) promptly notify the other parties of any substantive communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Authority and, subject to Applicable Law, permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning any competition or antitrust matters in connection with this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby unless in each case it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to any Competition Laws in connection with this Agreement.

The Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included in the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3, shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall respond as promptly as practicable to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3, shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement each time before it is filed with the SEC, shall give reasonable and good-faith consideration to any comments thereon made by Parent and its counsel, and shall cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form and the Schedule 13E-3 to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders at the earliest reasonably practicable date. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and (to the extent reasonably available to the applicable party) stockholders and such   62       other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to the SEC or NASDAQ in connection with the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E- 3. If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of each of the Company and Parent.   Section 8.03. Public Announcements. Except in connection with the matters contemplated by Section 6.04 or in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, having any communication with the press (whether or not for attribution) or making any other public statement, or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than any press release, communication, public statement, press conference or conference call which has a bona fide purpose that does not relate to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and in which no information of or regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are mentioned that has not previously been disclosed to the public in accordance with this Section 8.03) and shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call before such consultation except to the extent required to do so by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the issuance of any press release or the making of any public statement with respect to which the foregoing consultation procedures have been followed, either party may issue such additional publications or press releases and make such other customary announcements without consulting with any other party hereto so long as such additional publications, press releases and announcements do not disclose any non-public information regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement beyond the scope of the disclosure included in the press release or public statement with respect to which the other party had been consulted.

(c)   In the event the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii) or Section 10.01(d)(iii) (or pursuant to Section 10.01(b) (i), if at the time of termination, the Company could have terminated the Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii) or Section 10.01(d)(iii), in each case in this parenthetical without regard to any notice, cure or other time periods set forth in Section 10.01(d)(ii) or Section 10.01(d)(iii)), then Parent shall pay to the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days following such termination) the Liquidated Damages Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided,   71       however, that such amount shall not be payable if at the time of termination, Parent could then have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)(B) or Section 10.01(c)(ii) (in each case, without regard to any notice, cure or other time periods set forth in Section 10.01(c)(i)(B) or Section 10.01(c)(ii)).

The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty (or covenant, as applicable) shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) Subject to Section 11.06(b), the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto;








________________


provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub may (a) assign any or all of their rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, provided that no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder or prevent, delay or impair the transactions contemplated hereby or (b) collaterally assign, without the Company’s or any other parties consent, any or all of the Parent’s or Merger Sub’s rights and obligations hereunder to any party providing the Debt Financing, which party may exercise all of the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder in connection with the enforcement of any security or exercise of any remedies to the extent permitted under the Debt Financing arrangements, provided that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment, delegation or other transfer in contravention of this Section 11.06(b) shall be void.   Section 11.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.   Section 11.08. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any Legal Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Legal Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Legal Action in any such court or that any such Legal Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Action may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.   Section 11.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.   73         Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).   Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.   Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   Section 11.13. Specific Performance.   (a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 11.13, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement, including, subject to Section 10.02, monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 11.13 are not available or otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing contained in this Section 11.13 shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to institute any   74       proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 11.13 before exercising any termination right under Article 10 (and pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this Section 11.13 or anything contained in this Section 11.13 restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 10 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, prior to the End Date, any party brings any Legal Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by the amount of time during which such Legal Action is pending, plus 20 Business Days, or such longer time period established by the court presiding over such Legal Action, if any.   (b)   Without limiting Section 11.13(a), the Company shall be entitled to specific performance of the obligation of Parent to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing in the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in ​Section 9.01 and ​Section 9.02 have been satisfied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement at the time the Closing is required to occur pursuant to ​Section 2.01 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions assuming a Closing would occur at such time; (ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that, as of such time, based on the information then-available to the Company, all of the conditions set forth in ​Section 9.01 and ​Section 9.03 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) or that the Company is prepared to irrevocably waive any unsatisfied conditions, and if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded, and each of Parent and Merger Sub otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder, then the Company is ready, willing and able to, and will take such actions as are within its control to, consummate the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub fails to complete the Closing pursuant to and in accordance with ​Section 2.01.

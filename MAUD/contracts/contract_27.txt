ARTICLE I 


THE MERGER 


Section 1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), at the Closing, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue its existence under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”) and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. 


Section 1.2 Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the fifth Business Day) after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the last of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the “Closing Date.” The Closing shall be held at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, or remotely by exchange of documents and signatures (or their electronic counterparts), unless another place is agreed upon in writing by the Company and Parent. 


Section 1.3 Effective Time. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”), executed and filed in accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other, later date and time as is agreed between the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”). 


Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, claims, obligations, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, claims, obligations, liabilities and duties of the First Step Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL.   2








________________


Section 1.5 Organizational Documents. At the Effective Time, the Company’s Restated and Amended Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the “Company Certificate”) and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Company Bylaws”) shall be amended and restated, respectively, to be in substantially the forms attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2, and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law. 


Section 1.6 Directors and Officers. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. (b) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 


Section 1.7 Parent Board. The parties hereto shall take all necessary actions such that, at the Effective Time, two directors designated by the Company (each, a “Company Designee”) shall be appointed to the Parent Board, each reasonably acceptable to Parent, from among the directors serving on the Company Board as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each of whom must qualify as an “independent director” under applicable Nasdaq rules and regulations. Each Company Designee shall hold office until the earliest to occur of the appointment or election and qualification of his or her respective successor or his or her death, resignation, disqualification or proper removal as a member of the Parent Board. In the event that prior to the Effective Time any Company Designee is unwilling or unable to serve on the Parent Board, the Company shall select a replacement for such individual (who shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent) to serve in such person’s place. Parent agrees to nominate the Company Designees appointed to the Parent Board pursuant to this Section 1.7 for reelection at Parent’s first annual stockholders’ meeting that occurs after the Closing. 


ARTICLE II 


CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 


Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock in the Merger. 


(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares or securities of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub: (i) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   3








________________


(ii) Cancellation of Certain Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held in treasury by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent, its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist (the “Cancelled Shares”), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. (iii) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall, at the Effective Time, be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive (A) $220.00 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”) and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as specified in Section 2.1(d) and the Cash Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book- entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1. (b) Shares of Dissenting Stockholders. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (“DGCL 262” and any such shares meeting the requirement of this sentence, “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with DGCL 262 (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by DGCL 262); provided that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under DGCL 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to DGCL 262 and of any withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   4








________________


(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (and as permitted by Article V), the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided that nothing in this Section 2.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. (d) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or with respect to Book-Entry Shares or otherwise, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares evidenced by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive from Parent, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, a cash payment (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Common Stock VWAP (rounded down to the nearest penny). 


Section 2.2 [Reserved]. 


Section 2.3 Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement relating to the Exchange Agent’s responsibilities with respect thereto, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. 


Section 2.4 Surrender and Exchange of Shares. (a) Deposit of Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, at Parent’s election) representing the full number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the stock portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the cash portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration, in each case payable in the Merger to all holders of Company Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto and including any amounts to be paid in cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(d), the “Exchange Fund”).   5








________________


(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event within five Business Days of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon, (A) with respect to shares evidenced by Certificates, delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and (B) with respect to Book-Entry Shares, upon proper delivery of an “agent’s message” regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), as applicable, to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree upon prior to the Effective Time) (the “Letter of Transmittal”) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.1(d). (c) Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably and customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive, within two Business Days following the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Exchange Agent’s receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement together with any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.4(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4(c), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.4(d).   6








________________


(d) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of Company Common Stock to be converted into cash and shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) until such holder shall surrender such share in accordance with this Section 2.4. After the surrender in accordance with this Section 2.4 of a share of Company Common Stock to be converted into cash and shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii), the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to the Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to this Article II) any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the share of Parent Common Stock represented by such share of Company Common Stock. (e) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The shares of Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Section 2.4 (together with any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.4(d)), without interest and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. (f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Article II, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund, and such investments shall only be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Laws of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Standard & Poor’s Corporation or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., respectively. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to Section 2.1. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 2.1, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.   7








________________


(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II without any interest thereon. (h) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this Article II that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. (i) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate or a Book- Entry Share pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority and, to the extent such amounts are paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. (j) Lost Certificates.

Section 2.5 Treatment of Company Equity Awards. (a) Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each award of Company RSUs that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than awards of Director RSUs, shall be converted into an award covering that number of Parent restricted stock units of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, (“Converted RSUs”) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award of Company RSUs (and, with respect to any Company RSUs that are subject to performance-vesting goals or metrics, the number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be determined based on the greater of the target or actual level of achievement of such goals or metrics immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined by the Company Board or a committee thereof) and (y) the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio, and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Consideration by (ii) the Parent Common Stock VWAP. Any Converted RSUs issued pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable change of control or other accelerated vesting provisions, whether pursuant to an award agreement or any other agreement between the Company and any holder of any award of Company RSUs or pursuant to any other arrangement or plan applicable to any holder of an award of Company RSUs); provided that any Company RSUs, the vesting of which had been subject to performance goals or metrics prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to be subject to any such performance-vesting goals or metrics and shall, following the Effective Time, be subject solely to time- and service-based vesting. (b) Director RSUs. At the Effective Time, each Director RSU (whether or not vested) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, vest (if unvested) and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1 as if such Director RSU had been settled in shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Director RSU Consideration”). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of a Director RSU the Director RSU Consideration, less any applicable Taxes and without interest, within two Business Days following the Effective Time, subject to any delay required by the next sentence; provided that any such withholding Taxes required to be paid by or collected on behalf of such holder shall be satisfied by retaining a number of shares of Parent Common Stock having a fair market value (determined by reference to the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date) equal to the minimum statutory amount required to be withheld. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any Director RSU that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that the Company determines prior to the Effective Time is not eligible to be terminated in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such payment will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Benefit Plan that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. (c) Involuntary Termination. Notwithstanding the vesting schedule and any other vesting conditions applicable to any Company RSUs or Converted RSUs, in the event that the employment of a Continuing Employee (other than any Continuing Employee that is a participant under the Company’s Change in Control Severance Plan (as amended, the “CIC Plan”) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) (each such Continuing Employee, a “Covered Continuing Employee”) is terminated by the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries without Cause (as defined in Section 2.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) within the period beginning immediately following the Closing Date and ending on the date that is 12 months following the Closing Date (or, if earlier, December 31, 2022) (such termination, a   9

“Qualifying Termination”), the vesting of each award of Converted RSUs resulting solely from a Company RSU that was outstanding and held by such Covered Continuing Employee as of the date of this Agreement (and not any other Converted RSUs) will accelerate as to: (A) if such Covered Continuing Employee’s Qualifying Termination occurs during calendar year 2021, the sum of: (x) 100% of the total number of Converted RSUs that otherwise would have vested during calendar year 2021 under the applicable vesting schedule in effect on the Closing had such Covered Continuing Employee remained employed with the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries through the last applicable vesting date for such award in calendar year 2021 (and reduced by the total number of Converted RSUs that vested in calendar year 2021 prior to such Qualifying Termination plus (y) 50% of the total number of Converted RSUs that otherwise would have vested during calendar year 2022 under the applicable vesting schedule in effect on the Closing had such Covered Continuing Employee remained employed with the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries through the last applicable vesting date for such award in calendar year 2022, or (B) if such Covered Continuing Employee’s Qualifying Termination occurs during calendar year 2022, 50% of the total number of Converted RSUs that otherwise would have vested during calendar year 2022 under the applicable vesting schedule in effect on the Closing had such Covered Continuing Employee remained employed with the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries through the last applicable vesting date for such award in calendar year 2022 (and reduced by the total number of Converted RSUs that vested in calendar year 2022 prior to such Qualifying Termination). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.5(c) shall not amend, modify, change or in any way limit any vesting acceleration provided for in any plan or arrangement maintained by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any agreement between the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Continuing Employee, on the other hand. (d) Company and Parent Actions. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary or advisable to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.5 under all Company equity plans or any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required notices, obtaining all necessary consents, and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary to reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of each Converted RSU. As soon as practicable on or following the Effective Time, but no later than three Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8, Form S-3 or Form S-1 (or any successor or other appropriate form), as applicable, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such award of Converted RSUs and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding. (e) ESPP. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company Board or a committee thereof shall adopt resolutions to provide that each individual participating in an Offering (as defined in the ESPP) in progress on the date hereof shall not be permitted to (i) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect as of the date hereof or (ii) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date hereof, except as may be required by applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause any Offering that would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective Time to   10

On such exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company shall terminate the ESPP. 


Section 2.6 Further Assurances. If at any time before or after the Effective Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Mergers and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, management of the Company has disclosed to the Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company’s ability to report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting, in each case, that was disclosed to the Company’s auditors or the audit committee of the Company Board in connection with its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof. The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding transactions being executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization, the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.   16

Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parent’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent’s internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2019, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, management of Parent has disclosed to Parent’s auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parent’s ability to report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal controls over financial reporting, in each case, that was disclosed to Parent’s auditors or the audit committee of the Parent Board in connection with its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof. Parent maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding transactions being executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization, the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parent’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.4, if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, directly or indirectly receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that did not result from a material breach (or a deemed material breach) of this Section 5.4 and if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, and failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, directly or indirectly, (i) furnish, pursuant to a Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the person that has made such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources of funding; provided that the Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously provided or made available to Parent and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (including as a part thereof, making counterproposals) and its Representatives and potential sources of financing regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. “Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means any customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those applicable to Parent that are contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the provisions of this Section 5.4.

In lieu thereof, at or prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company may, in its sole discretion, or (ii) Parent may, in each case, at Parent’s cost, purchase directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability “tail” insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are not less favorable than the D&O Insurance, and that is otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that in no event shall the cost of such “tail” insurance, if purchased by the Company, exceed the Maximum Amount and, if such “tail” insurance is purchased, Parent shall have no further obligations under this Section 5.10(c).

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and legal representatives) to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the consent of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, (i) the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10 and (ii) this Section 5.10 shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal representatives against Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.   74

Any such bonus shall be paid to the applicable employee no later than the next payroll of the Company or the applicable Affiliate employing such employee that occurs following the Closing Date and, in any event, no later than 20 days following the Closing Date (in each case, unless prohibited by Section 409A of the Code, in which case, it shall be paid on the earliest date permitted by Section 409A of the Code).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company to honor, in accordance with their terms without giving effect to any amendments thereto after the Closing Date, all payments, benefits and obligations under any employment, change in control and severance plans, agreements and arrangements of the Company and its Affiliates that are set forth on Section 5.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

In such event, prior to the Closing Date and thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall take any and all action as may be required, including amendments to a U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (each, a “Parent Qualified Plan”), to vest all account balances in the terminated Company Qualified Plans and permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in cash or notes (representing plan loans from the Company Qualified Plan) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributable to such Continuing Employee from such Company Qualified Plan to the corresponding Parent Qualified Plan. If the Company Qualified Plan is terminated as described herein, (i) the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in a Parent Qualified Plan as soon as practicable following the Closing Date and (ii) the Company shall provide Parent evidence that the Company Qualified Plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(h) Effective as of the Closing, the Company shall pay to each “exempt” employee (within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended) located in North America an amount equal to such employee’s accrued or credited but unused vacation time. To the extent not paid at the Closing, Parent shall cause such amounts to be paid to the applicable employee no later than the next payroll of the Company or the applicable Affiliate employing such employee that occurs following the Closing Date and, in any event, no later than 20 days following the Closing Date. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 5.16 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee; (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 5.16, require Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any person, including any Continuing Employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries; or (iv) establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.   79

suffered by the Company or Parent, as applicable, as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances and neither Party shall have any other liability to the other after the payment of such Termination Fee Payment or Expense Payment, except in the case of fraud or a Willful and Material Breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Termination Fee Payment shall become due and payable in accordance with Section 7.3(a), Section 7.3(b), Section 7.3(c) or Section 7.3(d), as applicable, from and after such termination and payment of the Termination Fee Payment pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.3(a), Section 7.3(b), Section 7.3(c), or Section 7.3(d), as applicable, the paying Party shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under Section 7.3(a), Section 7.3(b), Section 7.3(c) or Section 7.3(d), as applicable, except in the case of fraud or a Willful and Material Breach. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Termination Fee Payment and Expense Payments are not intended to be a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee Payment and/or Expense Payment is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful and Material Breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall any Party be entitled to more than one payment of the Termination Fee Payment in connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the Termination Fee Payment is payable, and if the Termination Fee Payment is payable at such time as the receiving Party has already received payment or concurrently receives payment from the paying Party in respect of the Parent Expense Payment or the Company Expense Payment, as applicable, the amount of such Parent Expense Payment or the Company Expense Payment actually received by Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall be deducted from the Termination Fee Payment due and payable to such Party. Without limiting Section 8.13, the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent China Regulatory Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company against the Financing Sources under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. (g) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a Party fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, then such Party shall reimburse the other Party for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any related Actions commenced and pay interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.   94

BYLAWS 


ARTICLE I — MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 


1.1 Place of Meetings. Meetings of stockholders of Coherent, Inc. (the “Company”) shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, determined by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”). The Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). In the absence of any such designation or determination, stockholders’ meetings shall be held at the Company’s principal executive office. 


1.2 Annual Meeting. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date and time as may be designated by resolution of the Board from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting. The Company shall not be required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders, provided that (i) the stockholders are permitted to act by written consent under the Company’s certificate of incorporation and these bylaws, (ii) the stockholders take action by written consent to elect directors and (iii) the stockholders unanimously consent to such action or, if such consent is less than unanimous, all of the directorships to which directors could be elected at an annual meeting held at the effective time of such action are vacant and are filled by such action. 


1.3 Special Meeting. A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board, Chairperson of the Board, Chief Executive Officer or President (in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer) or by one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 10% of the votes at that meeting. 


If any person(s) other than the Board calls a special meeting, the request shall: (i) be in writing; (ii) specify the time of such meeting and the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted; and (iii) be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by facsimile transmission to the Chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President (in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer) or the Secretary of the Company. 


The officer(s) receiving the request shall cause notice to be promptly given to the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, in accordance with these bylaws, that a meeting will be held at the time requested by the person or persons calling the meeting. No business may be transacted at such special meeting other than the business specified in such notice to stockholders. Nothing contained in this paragraph of this section 1.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board may be held.








________________


1.4 Notice of Stockholders’ Meetings. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise provided in the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. 


1.5 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 


If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairperson of the meeting, or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in section 1.6, until a quorum is present or represented. 


1.6 Adjourned Meeting; Notice. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Company may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 213(a) of the DGCL and section 1.10 of these bylaws, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. 


1.7 Conduct of Business. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the Vice Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by the Chief Executive Officer, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by the President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairperson designated by the Board, or in the absence of such designation by a chairperson chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business.   2

1.8 Voting. The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1.10 of these bylaws, subject to Section 217 (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock) and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts and other voting agreements) of the DGCL. 


Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, unless otherwise required by law, need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. If authorized by the Board, such requirement of a written ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission (as defined in section 7.2 of these bylaws), provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder. 


Except as otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class or series or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or series or classes or series, except as otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 


1.9 Stockholder Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by the DGCL to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. 


An electronic transmission (as defined in section 7.2) consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxy holder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxy holder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for purposes of this section, provided that any such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Company can determine (i) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxy holder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxy holder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or proxy holder or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission.   3








________________


In the event that the Board shall have instructed the officers of the Company to solicit the vote or written consent of the stockholders of the Company, an electronic transmission of a stockholder written consent given pursuant to such solicitation may be delivered to the Secretary or the President of the Company or to a person designated by the Secretary or the President. The Secretary or the President of the Company or a designee of the Secretary or the President shall cause any such written consent by electronic transmission to be reproduced in paper form and inserted into the corporate records. 


Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Company as provided in Section 228 of the DGCL. In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any provision of the DGCL, if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such provision shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such provision concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL. 


1.10 Record Dates. In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. 


If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. 


A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the provisions of Section 213 of the DGCL and this Section 1.10 at the adjourned meeting.   4

In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company in accordance with applicable law. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 


In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. 


1.11 Proxies. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL. 


1.12 List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Company shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The Company shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the Company’s principal place of business. In the event that the Company determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Company may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Company. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.   5

Unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors, the number of directors shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board.

2.3 Election, Qualification and Term of Office of Directors. Except as provided in section 2.4 of these bylaws, and subject to sections 1.2 and 1.9 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders.

2.4 Resignation and Vacancies. Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the Company. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. A resignation which is conditioned upon the director failing to receive a specified vote for reelection as a director may provide that it is irrevocable. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, when one or more directors resign from the Board, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective. 


Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws: (i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. (ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.   6

If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the voting stock at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the DGCL as far as applicable. 


A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office and until such director’s successor is elected and qualified, or until such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal.

If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting. 


The vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 


If the certificate of incorporation provides that one or more directors shall have more or less than one vote per director on any matter, every reference in these bylaws to a majority or other proportion of the directors shall refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes of the directors. 


2.10 Board Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.

ARTICLE III — COMMITTEES 3.1 Committees of Directors. The Board may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Company. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Company, and may authorize the seal of the Company to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) approve or adopt, or recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (ii) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the Company.

5.1 Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Third Party Proceedings. Subject to the other provisions of this Article V, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”) (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful. 


5.2 Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Actions by or in the Right of the Company. Subject to the other provisions of this Article V, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereinafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which   11








________________


such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 


5.3 Successful Defense. To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described in section 5.1 or section 5.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 


5.4 Indemnification of Others. Subject to the other provisions of this Article V, the Company shall have power to indemnify its employees and agents to the extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law. The Board shall have the power to delegate to such person or persons the determination of whether employees or agents shall be indemnified. 


5.5 Advanced Payment of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or director of the Company in defending any Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of a written request therefor (together with documentation reasonably evidencing such expenses) and an undertaking by or on behalf of the person to repay such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article V or the DGCL. Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents of the Company or by persons serving at the request of the Company as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate. The right to advancement of expenses shall not apply to any Proceeding for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to these bylaws, but shall apply to any Proceeding referenced in section 5.6(ii) or 5.6(iii) prior to a determination that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. 


5.6 Limitation on Indemnification.

To the extent not prohibited by law, the Company shall indemnify such person against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any action for indemnification or advancement of expenses from the Company under this Article V, to the extent such person is successful in such action.

The Company is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advancement of expenses, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law.

The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL.   13








________________


5.10 Survival. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Article V shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 


5.11 Effect of Repeal or Modification.

ARTICLE VI — STOCK 


6.1 Stock Certificates; Partly Paid Shares. The shares of the Company shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Company. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Company by the Chairperson of the Board or Vice-Chairperson of the Board, or the President or a Vice-President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Company with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. The Company shall not have power to issue a certificate in bearer form.   14








________________


The Company may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the Company in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the Company shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon. 


6.2 Special Designation on Certificates. If the Company is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the Company shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the DGCL, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the Company shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the Company will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the Company shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this section 6.2 or Sections 156, 202(a) or 218(a) of the DGCL or with respect to this section 6.2 a statement that the Company will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated stock and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall be identical. 


6.3 Lost Certificates. Except as provided in this section 6.3, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the Company and cancelled at the same time. The Company may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Company may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner’s legal representative, to give the Company a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.   15








________________


6.4 Dividends. The Board, subject to any restrictions contained in the certificate of incorporation or applicable law, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of the Company’s capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the Company’s capital stock, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation. 


The Board may set apart out of any of the funds of the Company available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. 


6.5 Stock Transfer Agreements. The Company shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the Company to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the Company of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the DGCL. 


6.6 Registered Stockholders. The Company: (i) shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner; (ii) shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares; and (iii) shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. 


6.7 Transfers. Transfers of record of shares of stock of the Company shall be made only upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by an attorney duly authorized, and, if such stock is certificated, upon the surrender of a certificate or certificates for a like number of shares, properly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer. 


ARTICLE VII — MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE AND WAIVER 7.1 Notice of Stockholder Meetings. Notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder’s address as it appears on the Company’s records. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Company that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 


7.2 Notice by Electronic Transmission. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Company under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Company. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: (i) the Company is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Company in accordance with such consent; and   16








________________


(ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice. 


However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 


Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. 


An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Company that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 


An “electronic transmission” means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. 


Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Sections 164, 296, 311, 312 or 324 of the DGCL. 


7.3 Notice to Stockholders Sharing an Address. Except as otherwise prohibited under the DGCL, without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Company under the provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Company. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Company, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Company of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.   17








________________


7.4 Notice to Person with Whom Communication is Unlawful. Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the Company is such as to require the filing of a certificate under the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. 


7.5 Waiver of Notice. Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 


ARTICLE VIII — GENERAL MATTERS 


8.1 Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Company shall be fixed by resolution of the Board and may be changed by the Board. 


8.2 Seal. The Company may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Board. The Company may use the corporate seal by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced. 


8.3 Annual Report. The Company shall cause an annual report to be sent to the stockholders of the Company to the extent required by applicable law. If and so long as there are fewer than 100 holders of record of the Company’s shares, the requirement of sending an annual report to the stockholders of the Company is expressly waived (to the extent permitted under applicable law). 


8.4 Construction; Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the DGCL shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term “person” includes both a corporation and a natural person. 


ARTICLE IX — AMENDMENTS 


These bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote. However, the Company may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.   18

A bylaw amendment adopted by stockholders which specifies the votes that shall be necessary for the election of directors shall not be further amended or repealed by the Board.   19

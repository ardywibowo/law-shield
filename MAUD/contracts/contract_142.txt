RECITALS 


A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the “Offer”) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the “Company Shares”) for $53.00 per share of Company Common Stock, in cash (such amount, or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the “Offer Price”), without interest, subject to any applicable withholding Taxes. 


B. Following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided in Section 2.5, (i) each issued and outstanding Company Share (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest, subject to any applicable withholding Taxes, and (ii) the Company shall become a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger. 


C. The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii) agreed that the Merger shall be subject to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the Offer and tender their Company Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the recommendation of the Company Board, the “Company Board Recommendation”). 


D. The board of directors or authorized committee thereof of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this Agreement and the Transactions and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively, to enter into this Agreement. 


E. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledges and agrees that the Merger shall be governed by, and effected pursuant to, Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be consummated as soon as practicable following the Offer Acceptance Time. 


F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent and Purchaser entering into this Agreement, certain holders of the Company Shares (the “Principal Stockholders”) have entered into tender and support agreements, dated as of the Agreement Date, in substantially the form set forth in Annex II, pursuant to which, among other things, each of the Principal Stockholders has agreed to tender his, her or its Company Shares to Purchaser in the Offer (the “Tender Agreements”).

AGREEMENT The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 


SECTION 1 THE OFFER 1.1 The Offer. (a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Agreement Date, subject to the Company then being prepared to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same day as the commencement of the Offer, and having complied in all material respects with its obligations to provide information to Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.1(e) and 1.2(b), but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer. (b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the “Offer Conditions”), as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms, and promptly accept for payment and promptly thereafter pay for all Company Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the “Offer Closing”). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the “Offer to Purchase”) that contains terms not inconsistent with those set forth in this Agreement. Purchaser and Parent expressly reserve the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Company Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects any holder of Company Shares (collectively, the “Company Stockholders”) in its capacity as such, (F) change or waive the Minimum Condition, (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date of the Offer (except to the extent permitted or required pursuant to Section 1.1(c)) or (H) provide any “subsequent offering period” within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be terminated prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer without the prior written consent of the Company, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8. (c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire one minute following 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the Offer Commencement Date, determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under   2








________________


the Exchange Act (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the “Initial Expiration Date,” and such date or such subsequent date and time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the “Expiration Date”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties’ respective termination rights under Section 8: (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, if permitted hereunder and under applicable Laws, Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for additional periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) the minimum period required by any Law or any interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq or its staff, in each case, applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, (A) any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied or (B) the Minimum Condition is not satisfied, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer on up to two occasions for additional periods specified by the Company of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit the Minimum Condition to be satisfied; provided, that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (the “Extension Deadline”) (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8 and (y) the End Date; or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company. (d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Laws, all tendered Company Shares to the registered holders thereof. (e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the “Schedule TO”) that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto (which together constitute the “Offer Documents”) filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Laws. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to use all reasonable efforts to cause the Offer   3

The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed upon in writing by the Parties and specified in the certificate of merger (such date and time, the “Effective Time”). 2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time: (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time, as determined by Parent prior to Closing, to conform to Exhibit B, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be “Viela Bio, Inc.”; (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are the directors and officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time. 2.5 Conversion of Company Shares. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: (i) any Company Shares then held by the Company (or held in the Company’s treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; (ii) any Company Shares then held by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;   6








________________


(iii) except as provided in clauses “(i)” and “(ii)” above (the “Excluded Shares”) and subject to Section 2.5(b), each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and (other than any Dissenting Shares, as defined below) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the “Merger Consideration”), without interest, subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes, and each holder of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.6; and (iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Purchaser outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. (b) If, between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted. 2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the holders of Company Shares to receive the aggregate Offer Price to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Substantially concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5 (together, the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. (b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the Company Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Company Shares (the “Certificates”) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.6(e), if applicable) to the Paying Agent), or a customary agent’s message in respect of Book-Entry Shares and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu in accordance with Section 2.6(e), if applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Share   7

formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Offer Price payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, for the benefit such holder. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Company Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all Transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the Transfer Taxes described in this Section 2.6(b) under any circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.5.

(c) Subject to Section 2.8(a), each Company Option that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares (each, a “Converted Option”). Except as expressly provided below, each Converted Option will continue to have and be subject to substantially the same vesting terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option immediately before the Effective Time, except that (i) each Converted Option will be exercisable for that number of shares of Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (A) the number of Company Shares subject to the Company Option immediately before the Effective Time and (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; and (ii) the per share exercise price for each share of Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Converted Option will be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option immediately before the Effective Time by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that the exercise price and the number of shares of Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares purchasable under each Converted Option will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder; provided, further, that in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder.   10

Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9, as applicable, is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented, or at the time it is first distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. 4.6 Absence of Litigation.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a complete and correct copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter. Parent has also delivered to the Company a complete and correct copy of the Debt Fee Letter (redacted to exclude fees and other provisions that do not affect the conditionality of the Debt Financing at the request of the Financing Sources party thereto). (b) The Debt Commitment Letter is, as of the Agreement Date, in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower, and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Purchaser, the other parties thereto, in each case except as enforcement thereof may be limited against Borrower by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Purchaser, no such withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is presently contemplated by Parent, Purchaser or Borrower (other than amendments or modifications that are permitted by Section 6.15(a)). Except for the Debt Commitment Letter, as of the Agreement Date, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter that impose any additional conditions thereto, modify any conditions thereto or otherwise affect the availability of the Debt Financing. The Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Debt Financing available to Borrower, on the terms in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the Agreement Date, neither Parent nor Purchaser has any reason to believe that Borrower will be unable to satisfy any term or condition to be satisfied by it as a condition to the availability of the Debt Financing contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, nor any reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing will not be satisfied. As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Borrower, Parent or Purchaser and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter only, to the Knowledge of Parent and Purchaser) any of the other parties thereto, under any term of the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that none of Borrower,   40

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to Offer Acceptance Time: (i) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a material breach of Section 5.4) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and, after consultation with outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such   51

Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, that the failure to do so is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) at least four (4) Business Days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a “Determination Notice”) (which notice shall not constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation); and (C) (1) the Company shall have provided to Parent all information contemplated to be provided in accordance with Section 5.4(d), (2) the Company shall have given Parent the four (4) Business Days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, (3) after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws, and (4) if the Company intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement, the Company shall have complied with Section 8.1(f). Issuance of any “stop, look and listen” communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f), in and of itself, shall not be considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment (which shall include any change to the financial terms, including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4) Business Days shall be deemed to be three (3) Business Days; and (ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, that the failure to do so is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified the Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the four (4) Business Days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals so that such Intervening Event would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and shall have made its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to do so) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by   52

Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4) Business Days shall be deemed to be three (3) Business Days. 6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity in connection with any Antitrust Laws; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties; and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions. (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement Date, make an appropriate filing of all Notification and Report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions. Each Party shall furnish to the other Party or its outside counsel such necessary information and assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or submissions by it to any Governmental Entity. (c) Each Party hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with any inquiry by any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.2, each Party hereto shall give the other Parties prompt notice of any pending or threatened request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Entity, or brought by a third party before any Governmental Entity, in each case with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Laws (an “Antitrust Investigation”). In connection with any such Antitrust Investigation, and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and appropriate agreements to limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel and preserve the attorney-client or other legal privileges, each Party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (ii) promptly inform the other Parties   53

of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Entity in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (and if in writing, furnish the other Party with a copy of such communication), (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the other Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental Entity, and (iv) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, provide advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the other Party to be present at each material meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity and to have access to and be consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental Entity. Parent may withdraw and refile its filing under the HSR Act if, in its good faith judgment, it determines (after consultation with the Company and taking the Company’s views into account), that the taking of such action would be consistent with, and would not undermine, the parties’ efforts to expeditiously consummate the Transactions. (d) The Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any Person, including any Governmental Entity, under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the End Date; provided that such litigation in no way limits the obligation of Purchaser and Parent to use their reasonable best efforts to make effective the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable. The Company will not commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend, directly or indirectly, any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or pull and refile under the HSR Act, without Parent’s prior review and approval. (e) Parent agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire any assets, business or any Person, whether by merger, consolidation, purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any Person or by any other manner or engage in any other transaction, if the entering into of an agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase or other transaction would reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult or to materially increase the time required to obtain the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act. 6.3 Company Equity Awards. (a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Equity Awards are outstanding or otherwise) to (i) cause the treatment (as applicable) of each unexercised Company Option then outstanding as set forth in Section 2.8, and (ii) cause, as of the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised Company Option then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to be cancelled, terminated, extinguished, subject, if applicable, to payment or assumption and conversion by Parent, in either case, pursuant to Section 2.8.   54

(b) In lieu of the Company granting any Company Equity Awards for Fiscal Year 2021 to its employees in accordance with its compensation practices under the terms of the Company Equity Plans, no later than 30 days following the Closing, the Ultimate Parent will grant to each employee identified by the Company on Section 6.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter and who remains a Continuing Employee through the applicable grant date, an equity award under the assumed Viela Bio Amended and Restated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and/or any Ultimate Parent equity incentive plan, as determined by Ultimate Parent in its discretion, with a grant date fair value for financial accounting purposes that is not less than the value set forth opposite each employee’s name of Section 6.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 6.4 Employee Benefits. (a) Following the Closing Date and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, for employees of the Company who continue in the employ of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (“Continuing Employees”), (i) no less than the same base salary or hourly wage and annual target cash bonus percentage as applicable to the Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing (provided that the bonus shall be governed by the plan generally applicable to employees of U.S. Subsidiaries of Parent) and (ii) other employee benefits which are no less favorable in the aggregate to either of the following (to be determined within the Parent’s sole discretion): (A) those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to Closing, and (B) those provided to similarly situated employees of U.S. Subsidiaries of Parent (in either case, excluding any defined benefit pension benefits, retiree medical benefits and equity-based compensation), and in either case, subject to Section 6.4. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee, provided that any such termination is effected in accordance with applicable Law. (b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or to cause its Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate under any Employee Benefit Plans and arrangements (with the exception of any applicable pension plan and post-retirement health and life insurance) that are provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed by U.S. Subsidiaries of Parent for such Continuing Employee’s service with the Company, to the same extent recognized by the Company, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service. (c) Parent shall make commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive for each Continuing Employee, and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the health and welfare plans of U.S. Subsidiaries of Parent applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, payment requirement, pre-existing condition limitation, actively at work requirement or other restriction would not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the Company, (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability requirements (including pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements) with respect to such Continuing Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Continuing Employees under the   55

(d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Viela Bio, Inc. Executive Severance Plan adopted by the Company as of August 9, 2019 and the Viela Bio, Inc. Non-Executive Severance Plan adopted by the Company as of August 9, 2019 (the “Company Severance Plans”) will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and may not be amended, modified or terminated through and including the second anniversary of the Closing Date. (e) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any current or former employee, director or other service provider of the Company in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Employee Benefit Plan or benefit plan of Parent. 6.5 Termination of the Company’s 401(k) Plan. Unless otherwise directed by Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days before the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary actions to terminate its 401(k) plan, with such termination effective as of no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date.

Prior to and conditioned upon termination of the Company’s 401(k) plan, the Company shall take any action necessary to fully vest any and all unvested amounts of the accounts of all participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan that are impacted by such termination. 6.6 Appointment of the Plan Administrator of the Severance Plans.    At least five (5) Business Days before the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary actions to appoint a committee composed of three individuals, two of whom are designated by Ultimate Parent and one of whom is designated by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, as the “Plan Administrator” for each of the Company Severance Plans following the Effective Time, with such appointments automatically effective as of the Effective Time. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any resolutions or other corporate action (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) evidencing such appointment. 6.7 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. (a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company existing in favor of those Persons who are directors or officers of any Acquired Corporation as of the Agreement Date or have been directors or officers of any Acquired Corporation in the past (the “Indemnified Persons”) for their acts and omissions occurring prior   56

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain, in effect, the existing policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Acquired Corporations as of the Agreement Date (an accurate and complete copy of which has been Made Available by the Company to Parent or Parent’s Representatives prior to the Agreement Date) (the “Existing D&O Policy”), to the extent that directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage is commercially available; provided, that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing D&O Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage, including a “tail” or “runoff” insurance policy, (ii) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing D&O Policy (or for any substitute or “tail” policies) in excess of an amount equal to 250% of the most recently paid annual premium for the Existing D&O Policy (the “Maximum Premium”) and (iii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall issue a broker of record letter acceptable to Parent permitting Parent’s insurance broker to negotiate and place such “tail” or “runoff” insurance of comparable coverage, and Parent shall have the right to negotiate such coverage and the Company shall reasonably cooperate therewith.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the acceptance of Company Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless   57

required by applicable Law, this Section 6.7 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person. 6.8 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any litigation brought against the Company and/or members of the Company Board or the Company’s officers (in their respective capacities as such) relating to the Transactions (“Transaction Litigation”) and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall control any Transaction Litigation; provided, that the Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment in advance on all filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such litigation and the right to participate (at Parent’s expense) in such litigation. No compromise or full or partial settlement of any Transaction Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this Section 6.8, “participate” means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to any Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise adversely affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above. 6.9 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the provisions of Section 6.2, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions.

The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such consent obtained by the Company during the Pre-Closing Period. 6.10 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement or making any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release, public statement or announcement to Company Associates without the other Party’s written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences,   58

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received.   68

DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Paragraph C of this Article SEVENTH with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or an advancement of expenses or as otherwise required by law, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any such Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. B. In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Paragraph A of this Article SEVENTH, an Indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney’s fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Paragraph B or otherwise. C. If a claim under Paragraph A or B of this Article SEVENTH is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article SEVENTH or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.   B-2

D. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article SEVENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. E. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. F. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article SEVENTH with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation. G. The rights conferred upon Indemnitees in this Article SEVENTH shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article SEVENTH that adversely affects any right of an Indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to any such amendment, alteration or repeal. H. If any word, clause, provision or provisions of this Article SEVENTH shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article SEVENTH (including, without limitation, each portion of any Paragraph of this Article SEVENTH containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article SEVENTH (including, without limitation, each such portion of any Paragraph of this Article SEVENTH containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 


EIGHTH: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for any monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty as a director; provided that this provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director, to the extent that such liability is imposed by applicable law, (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) under Section 174 or successor provisions of the DGCL; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of   B-3

any director for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

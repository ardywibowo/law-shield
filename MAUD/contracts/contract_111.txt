(h) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Company’s 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the “ESPP”), the Company Board (or a committee thereof) adopted resolutions and took other actions as were reasonably necessary or required to provide that each individual participating in an Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress on December 11, 2020 would not be permitted to (i) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect as of December 11, 2020; or (ii) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following December 11, 2020, except as may be required by applicable law. No individual who is not a current participant in the ESPP with respect to any current Offering Period as of December 11, 2020 will be allowed to commence participation in the ESPP following December 11, 2020.

To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.10; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for the Parent Entities (or the Payment Agent on behalf of the Parent Entities) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.10 for any reason, Parent Entities will, or will cause the Surviving Entities to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.10. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to the Parent Entities or the Surviving Entities, as Parent I directs. (c) Payment Procedures.

Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock, as applicable, represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price, Class B Per Share Price, or Class C Per Share Price, as applicable (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled.

The Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares and Holdings Units upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.

In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in and of itself, be deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, or modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) a Company Board Recommendation Change.

In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Company Merger Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Person’s entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Entities will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible).

Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation. (c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Company Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect on December 11, 2020 (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier on December 11, 2020. The Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier on December 11, 2020 so long as the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the amount set forth on Section 6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company elects to purchase such a “tail” policy, the Surviving Corporation will (and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect.   -78-

(d) Successors and Assigns. If any Parent Entity, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective successors or assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of such Parent Entity, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of such Parent Entity and the Surviving Entities set forth in this Section 6.10. (e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if such person were a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter, Bylaws and Holdings LLCA; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company Group; or (iv) applicable law (whether at law or in equity). (f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Entities, the Parent Entities and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be joint and several. (g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company Group for any of its directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements. 6.11 Employee Matters. (a) Acknowledgement. The Parent Entities hereby acknowledge and agree that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Offer Acceptance Time, Company Merger Effective Time and/or the Holdings Merger Effective Time, as applicable (but in no case more than once). (b) Existing Arrangements. Subject to this Section 6.11, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entities will (and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Entities to) honor all of the Employee Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving Entities from in any way amending, modifying or terminating any such Employee Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise permitted pursuant to applicable law. (c) Employment; Benefits. As of the Closing, the Surviving Entities or one of their respective Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of the Company Group as of the Company Merger Effective Time. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time until December 31, 2021 (or, if earlier, the termination date of an applicable Continuing Employee) (the “Continuation Period”) the Surviving   -79-

Entities and their respective Subsidiaries will (and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Entities and their respective Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans set forth on Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and any other employee benefit plans or other compensation and severance arrangements (other than defined pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-termination or retiree health or welfare, or equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements) of the applicable Surviving Entity or Subsidiary (the “Company Plans”) at benefit levels that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries on December 11, 2020, and provide compensation and benefits (other than defined pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-termination or retiree health or welfare, or equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than defined pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-termination or retiree health or welfare, or equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than defined pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-termination or retiree health or welfare, or equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (“Comparable Plans”); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. In each case, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, base compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be decreased for any Continuing Employee. During the Continuation Period, the Surviving Entities will (and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Entities to) provide severance benefits to eligible employees in accordance with the Company’s severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on December 11, 2020 and that have been made available to the Parent Entities prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing in this Section 6.11 shall obligate the Surviving Entities and their respective Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any specific period, and (y) the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11 shall not (i) apply to any individual during such time as such individual is furloughed, temporarily laid off, or suffers a termination of employment or reduction in hours or benefits at any time because of, in whole or in part, COVID-19-related circumstances, or (ii) limit the Surviving Entities’ or their Subsidiaries’ right, in their sole discretion, to furlough, temporarily layoff, terminate the employment of, or reduce the hours or benefits of, any employee because of, in whole or in part, COVID-19-related circumstances (in which case, for the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Entities and their Subsidiaries shall have no obligations under Section 6.11, including in respect of providing any severance or termination benefits). (d) New Plans. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entities and their respective Subsidiaries will (and the Parent Entities will cause the Surviving Entities and their respective Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company Group prior to the Company Merger Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and (for vacation and severance benefits only) entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant, except that (i) such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) such service shall only be credited to the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited under an analogous Company Plan, and (iii) no service shall be required to be credited under any Comparable Plan that provides for equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension, deferred compensation or post-termination or retiree welfare benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Surviving Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately   -80-

eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Entities and their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Company Merger Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, (x) the Surviving Entities will cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and (y) the Surviving Entities will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year ending on the Closing Date to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, co-pay, offsets and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Company Merger Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals (except to the extent that such limits or forfeitures applied under the Company Plans in effect as of December 11, 2020). (e) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of any Parent Entity, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11, require any Parent Entity, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Company Merger Effective Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. 6.12 Obligations of the Buyer Parties and the Company Parties. The Parent Entities will take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, and the Surviving Entities to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Mergers upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Buyer Parties will be jointly and severally liable for any breach of this Agreement by any Buyer Party (or, following the Closing, the Surviving Entities) or any other failure by any Buyer Party (or, following the Closing, the Surviving Entities) to perform and discharge any of its respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 6.13 Notification of Certain Matters. (a) Notification by the Company. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of the Original Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company will give prompt notice to the Parent Entities upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Buyer Parties to consummate (i) the Offer set forth in ANNEX I to fail to be satisfied as of the Expiration Time or (ii) the Mergers set forth in Section 7.1 to fail to be satisfied as of the Closing, except that no such notification will   -81-

The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to any Parent Entity pursuant to this Section 6.13(a). (b) Notification by Parent Entities. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of the Original Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Company Merger Effective Time, the Parent Entities will give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by the Buyer Parties in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by the Buyer Parties to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company Parties to consummate (i) the Offer set forth in ANNEX I to fail to be satisfied as of the Expiration Time or (ii) the Mergers set forth in Section 7.1 to fail to be satisfied as of the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Buyer Parties set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company Parties to consummate the Offer or the Mergers or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to the Company Parties pursuant to this Section 6.13(b). (c) Impact of Non-Compliance. The Company Parties’ or the Buyer Parties’ failure to comply with this Section 6.13 will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether any conditions set forth in ANNEX I or Article VII to consummate the Offer or the Mergers, as applicable, have been satisfied. 6.14 Public Statements and Disclosure. The initial press release concerning this Agreement and the Offer of the Company Parties, on the one hand, and the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, will each be reasonably acceptable to the other Party. Thereafter, the Company Parties (other than with respect to the portion of any communication relating to a Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to become public, in any such case to the extent relating to the Offer, the Mergers or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Original Agreement, except that the Company Parties, and with respect to clauses (i) and (iv), the Buyer Parties, will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that are (i) required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement; (ii) principally directed to employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications are consistent with the previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually if approved by the other Party); (iii) solely to the extent related to a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change; or (iv) with respect to any actual Legal Proceeding between the Company Parties or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Buyer Parties and their Affiliates, on the other hand. 6.15 Transaction Litigation. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Parties will provide the Parent Entities with prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep the Parent Entities reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company Parties will (a) give the Parent Entities the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with the Parent Entities with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation.

arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless the Parent Entities have consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this Section 6.15, “participate” means that the Parent Entities will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company Parties (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between a Company Party and its counsel is not undermined), and the Parent Entities may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above. 6.16 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration.

If at any time after the Holdings Merger Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving LLC with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of Holdings or Merger Sub II, then the proper officers or managers of each Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action. If at any time after the Company Merger Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the Company or Merger Sub I, then the proper officers and directors of each Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action. 6.18 Parent Vote.

(c) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company Parties be required to pay more than one Termination Fee, collectively, or be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. (d) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Offer and the Mergers, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company Parties fail to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, any Parent Entity commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company Parties for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof, the Company Parties will pay to any Parent Entity its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable law.

Other than the Guarantor’s obligations under the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the Buyer Parties’ obligations under this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than the Guarantor and the Buyer Parties have any liability for monetary damages to the Company Parties or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Offer or the Mergers.   -88-

(ii) The Parent Entities’ receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) will be the only monetary damages that the Buyer Parties and each of their respective Affiliates may recover from (A) the Company Group and its Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the Company Group and its Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Offer or the Mergers or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to the Buyer Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Tender Agreements Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d), as applicable); and (2) none of the Buyer Parties or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company Parties or any Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Tender Agreements Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d), as applicable). Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Company Parties for breaches under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed $104,600,000 in the aggregate for all such breaches (plus any obligations pursuant to Section 8.3(d)) (the “Company Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against any of the Company Related Parties, and in no event will the Buyer Parties be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against the Company Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Offer or the Mergers, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Offer or the Mergers or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. (f) Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.3(e) or the existence of the Parent Liability Limitation or the availability of monetary damages, it is agreed that the Buyer Parties and the Company Parties will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.8(b), except that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 9.8(b), under no circumstances will the Company Parties be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and any monetary damages. (g) Non-Recourse Parent Party. In no event will the Company Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Non-Recourse Parent Party (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter, which excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, the Guarantor and the Buyer Parties) with respect to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by the Guarantor or the Buyer Parties), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, other than from the Buyer Parties to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Guarantor to the extent expressly provided for in the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter.   -89-

supersedes in its entirety the Original Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Company Merger Effective Time and the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto. 9.6 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 6.10 and this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by Section 6.10; (b) if a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to grant specific performance and has instead granted an award of damages, then the Company may enforce such award and seek additional damages on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs and Holdings Incentive Units (which the Buyer Parties and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i); (c) if any of the Buyer Parties wrongfully terminate or willfully breach this Agreement, or if the Guarantor wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches the Guaranty, then, following the termination of this Agreement, the Company may seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs and Holdings RSUs (which the Buyer Parties and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i); and (d) from and after the Closing, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs and Holdings Incentive Units to receive the consideration set forth in Article II. The rights granted pursuant to clause (c) of the second sentence of this Section 9.6 will only be enforceable on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs and Holdings Incentive Units by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for such holders, and it is understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims will attach to such shares of the Company Common Stock, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Options, Holdings Units, Holdings RSUs or Holdings Incentive Units and subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i)) may, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion, be (A) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to such holders as of any date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company Group in any manner that the Company deems fit.

In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.   -93-

9.8 Remedies. (a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company (on behalf of the Company Parties) may pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages, under no circumstances will any of the Company Parties be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance). (b) Specific Performance. (i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company Parties, on the one hand, or the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Offer and the Mergers and without that right, neither the Company Parties nor the Buyer Parties would have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing the Buyer Parties’ obligations to consummate the Offer (including, subject to the satisfaction (or to the extent waivable, the waiver by Parent I (on behalf of the Buyer Parties)) of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub I’s obligation to accept for payment, and pay for, shares of Company Common Stock, Company Class B Stock and Company Class C Stock tendered in the Offer) and the Mergers and cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Offer and the Mergers (including to cause any Parent Entity to enforce the obligations of the Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements for any Debt Financing under the terms thereof, none of the Company Parties and their Affiliates and their direct and indirect equityholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing, and in no event shall any Company Party, any of its Affiliates or its or their direct or indirect equityholders be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any Financing Source. (ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or any Parent Entity, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Buyer Parties pursuant to this   -94-

Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. 9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Any and all claims, controversies, and causes of action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute, shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws or other rules that would result in the application of the laws or statutes of limitations of a different jurisdiction. 9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) General Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Offer, the Mergers and the Guaranty, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware (and any appellate court therefrom) or, if any federal court within the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court within the State of Delaware (and any appellate court therefrom)) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts.

This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed (including by electronic signature) by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity. 9.14 No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

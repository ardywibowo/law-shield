(a)          Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall represent one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time. 


(b) Capital Stock of the Company. 


(i)          Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares, any Converted Shares, any Dissenting Shares and Company Restricted Stock Awards, which shall be treated as set forth in Section 3.2(a)) (such shares of Company Common Stock, the “Eligible Shares”) shall be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (A) $11.00 per share in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash, the “Cash Consideration”) and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio from Parent (such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with the Cash Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”).  As used in this Agreement, “Exchange Ratio” means 0.32. 


(ii)          All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist.  Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares, Converted Shares, Dissenting Shares and Company Restricted Stock Awards, which shall be treated as set forth in Section 3.2(a)) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(g) and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the exchange of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.3(a). 


(iii)          All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, “Excluded Shares”) shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) (collectively, “Converted Shares”) shall automatically be converted into a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the quotient of the Cash Consideration divided by the Parent Share Price (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 3.1(c)). -2-








________________


(iv)          Each share of Company Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding as a share of Company Preferred Stock immediately following the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 


(c)          Impact of Stock Splits, Etc.  In the event of any change in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, conversion of any shares of Company Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company Preferred Stock and as permitted by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement), the Merger Consideration and any similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.1(c).  Nothing in this Section 3.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement. 


3.2 Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards. 


(a)          Company Options.  At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised option award to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (a “Company Option”), whether or not vested, shall be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, within five Business Days following the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the Net Option Payment subject to each such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.  For purposes of this Agreement, “Net Option Payment” means, with respect to a Company Option, the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value of the Merger Consideration shall equal the sum of (I) the Cash Consideration and (II) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the Parent Share Price. 


(b)          Company Restricted Stock Awards Generally.  At the Effective Time and except as provided in Section 3.2(c), each outstanding award of restricted Company Common Stock (a “Company Restricted Stock Award”) granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans shall be converted into an award of restricted Parent Common Stock (a “Parent Restricted Stock Award”) in respect of that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.2, each such Parent Restricted Stock Award shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any performance-based vesting conditions).  For purposes of this Agreement, “Equity Award Exchange Ratio” means the sum of (1) the Exchange Ratio, and (2) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of (a) the Cash Consideration, divided by (b) the Parent Share Price. 


(c)          Company Restricted Stock Awards Held by Non-Employee Directors.  At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and held by an individual who is a non-employee member of the Company Board as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with payment of any dividend equivalents that are accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of such Company Restricted Stock Award as in effect on the date hereof. -3-








________________


(d)          Company PSU Awards Generally.  At the Effective Time and except as provided in Section 3.2(e) and Section 3.2(f), each outstanding award of performance-based stock units relating to shares of Company Common Stock (the “Company PSU Awards”) granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans shall be converted into a Parent restricted stock unit award (a “Parent RSU Award”) in respect of that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined by deeming the performance goals to be achieved at 100%) multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.2, each such Parent RSU Award shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the performance-based vesting conditions shall no longer apply and the Parent RSU Award will be subject only to the applicable service-based vesting conditions. 


(e)          Specified Company PSU Awards.  At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company PSU Award with performance conditions based on the performance of a specified subsidiary of the Company, all of which are set forth on Section 3.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (such Company PSU Awards, the “Specified Company PSU Awards”), granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans shall be converted into a Parent performance-based stock unit award (a “Parent PSU Award”) in respect of that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.2(e), each such Parent PSU Award shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


(f)          Company PSU Awards Held by Former Employees.  At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company PSU Award (other than a Specified Company PSU Award) granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans that is held by an individual who is a former employee of the Company or its Affiliates as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that remains eligible to vest by its terms shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive, no later than the second regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company following the Effective Time, without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes, (i) the Merger Consideration, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (determined by deeming the performance goals to be achieved at 100% and with the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be prorated to the extent contemplated by the applicable award agreement) and (ii) any dividend equivalents that are accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of such Company PSU Award as in effect on the date hereof. 


(g)          Qualifying Termination.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the applicable award agreements or this Section 3.2, in the event a Company Employee experiences a Qualifying Termination within twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, the Parent Restricted Stock Awards, Parent RSU Awards and Parent PSU Awards shall vest in their entirety (with performance goals applicable to any Parent Restricted Stock Awards and Parent PSU Awards deemed achieved at 100% to the extent that the applicable performance period has not been completed prior to the Qualifying Termination) as of the date upon which the Qualifying Termination occurs. 


(h)          Administration.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall take such action and adopt such resolutions as are required to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Options, the Company Restricted Stock Awards and the Company PSU Awards pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.2, and (ii) if requested by Parent in writing at least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, cause the Company Stock Plans to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time.  As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Parent Restricted Stock Awards, Parent RSU Awards and Parent PSU Awards.  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to deliver the holders of the Parent Restricted Stock Awards, Parent RSU Awards and Parent PSU Awards appropriate notices indicating that the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company PSU Awards have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions, subject to  the adjustments and terms required by this Section 3.2 (which shall be described in such notices) after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Company Stock Plans. -4-

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with Parent’s transfer agent or another nationally recognized financial institution or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration and cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares, pursuant to Section 3.3(h) to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Article III.  Prior to or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance with this Article III through the Exchange Agent, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to Section 3.1 and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration.  Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.3(h).  The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.  Except as contemplated by this Section 3.3(a) and Sections 3.3(g) and 3.3(h), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.  Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(g)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement.  The cash portion of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government and no such investment (or any loss resulting therefrom) shall affect the cash payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.  To the extent, for any reason, the amount in the Exchange Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III, Parent shall promptly replace, restore or supplement the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III.  Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. 


(b) Payment Procedures. 


(i)          Certificates.  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Eligible Shares (“Certificates”), a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i).  Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder), (B) cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates and (C) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g). -5-








________________


(ii)          Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares.  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Eligible Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) not held through DTC, (A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a statement reflecting the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder), (C) cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of such Book-Entry Shares held by such holder and (D) cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g). 


(iii)          DTC Book-Entry Shares.  With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III. 


(iv)          No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Article III. 


(v)          With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)) is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.  With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)) shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b)(v), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g). 


(c)          Termination of Rights.  All Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(g) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h)) paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Eligible Shares previously represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g), without any interest thereon. -6-








________________


(d)          Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the nine-month anniversary after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g), in each case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts. 


(e)          No Liability.  None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.  If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(f)          Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(g). 


(g)          Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock.  No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid in respect of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that a holder of such Certificate would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid in respect of any unsurrendered Certificate, in each case until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3.  Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.  For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. -7-








________________


(h)          No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock.  No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending the two (2) trading days prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. (such price, the “Parent Share Price”).  As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.  The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange. 


(i)          Withholding Taxes.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law.  To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 


3.4          Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s rights to appraisal (the “Dissenting Shares”), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the “fair value” of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL); provided that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time), such holder’s shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give notice to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all material discussions with third parties and all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such demand or Proceeding relating to Dissenting Shares, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 


3.5          Further Assurances.  If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest Parent or the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to the Merger, the officers and managers of Parent (in the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) are authorized to take such action. -8-

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all requisite entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, other than, in the case of the Company’s Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized or to have such power, authority or standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (a “Company Material Adverse Effect”).  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification or license necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify, license or be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of the Organizational Documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, each as in effect as of the execution of this Agreement and each as made available to Parent is in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of such Organizational Documents.

The Company has sufficient authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock into shares of Company Common Stock.  There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or they are bound relating to the voting of any shares of capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  No Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of Company Capital Stock.

5.16          Opinion of Financial Advisor.  The Parent Board has received the opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs”) addressed to the Parent Board to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Goldman Sachs as set forth therein, the Merger Consideration and the Purchase Price (as defined in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement) to be paid by Parent for the shares of Company Common Stock and company Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement are fair from a financial point of view to Parent.  A copy of such opinion will be provided (solely for informational purposes) by Parent to the Company promptly following the execution of this Agreement.

5.20 Financing. 


(a)          Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of (i) the executed Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) the executed Debt Fee Letters (which may be redacted as to fees, yield or interest rate caps, original issue discount amounts, economic terms, flex terms and successful syndication level and other terms that are customarily redacted in connection with transactions of this type and would not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, net cash proceeds or principal amount (except, in the case of the principal amount, as a result of increased original issue discount or upfront fees resulting from the exercise of “price flex”) of the Financing).  Except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Fee Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Financing Entities party to the Debt Commitment Letter to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Financing Entities to reduce the total amount of the Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating to the total amount or availability of the Financing pursuant to any market flex provision. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to the debt financing of the Transactions, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or principal amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letters.  The commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement.  As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents (A) a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and (B) to Parent’s knowledge, a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each other party thereto, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), except as may be limited by applicable Creditors’ Rights.

As of the date of this Agreement, to Parent’s knowledge, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter.  As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of all of the conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to funding set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied, nor does Parent have knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter. -32-

(b)          Assuming the satisfaction of all of the conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of this Agreement, the proceeds of the Financing, if funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, together with any available cash of the Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, shall constitute sufficient funds for Parent and Merger Sub to make all cash payments they are required to make pursuant to this Agreement and the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (such payments, the “Required Uses”).  For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any financing, including the Financing, by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent be a condition to any of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations hereunder.

Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in Article IV and the estimates, projections or forecasts provided by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were, and continue to be, reasonable at and immediately after the Effective Time, then immediately following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) the present fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) and the fair value of the assets of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, will be greater than the total amount of their probable liabilities (including a reasonable estimate of the probable amount of all contingent liabilities), (ii) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, will be able to pay their respective debts and obligations in the ordinary course of business as they mature and become due, and (iii) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on a consolidated basis, will not have, or have access to, unreasonably small capital to carry on their respective businesses and the businesses in which they are about to engage.

Since the Applicable Date, there has not been, nor is there under consideration by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party) any recall or post-sale warning of a material nature concerning any product sold, produced or distributed by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

For purposes of this Agreement, “Company Alternative Transaction” means any of (1) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Parent and its Subsidiaries (such person (or group of persons), a “Company Third Party”), or the direct or indirect stockholders of such Company Third Party or the resulting company, acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, or would otherwise own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities, including, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of Company Preferred Stock) representing more than 20% or more of the equity or voting power of the Company (or the resulting company) (in the case of any such convertible or exchangeable security, on a fully diluted basis), (2) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any Company Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (3) any transaction pursuant to which any Company Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of Company and any entity surviving any merger or combination including any of them) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (4) any disposition of assets to a Company Third Party representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b)          Except as permitted by this Section 6.3(b) or Section 6.3(d), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Alternative Transaction, (iii) fail to include in the Joint Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation, or (iv) fail to, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer relating to shares of Company Capital Stock, recommend rejection of such tender or exchange offer or to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation (any action or failure to act in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a “Company Recommendation Change”).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that it has received a Company Superior Proposal that was not solicited, initiated, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated or otherwise procured in violation of this Section 6.3(a) (other than any violation that is immaterial in scope and effect), the Company Board may effect a Company Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) if (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to take such action, (C) the Company has provided Parent with a copy of the proposed definitive agreements between the Company and the person making such Company Superior Proposal, and the identity of the person making such Company Superior Proposal, (D) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (B) of this Section 6.3(b), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith and made the Company’s Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent’s Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under applicable Law of the Company Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or condition of any Company Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (I) two (2) Business Days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (II) the expiration of the original four (4)-Business Day period described in clause (D) above), and (E) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that (x) the Company Alternative Transaction that is the subject of the notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.  Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall cause or permit the Company or any of its controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any Company Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.3(a)). 


(c)          In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.3(a) and Section 6.3(b), the Company shall promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt thereof, advise Parent in writing of any request for information or proposal relating to a Company Alternative Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any changes thereto within twenty-four (24) hours of any such changes) and the identity of the person making such request or proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement, “Parent Alternative Transaction” means any of (1) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than the Company and its Subsidiaries (such person (or group of persons), a “Parent Third Party”), or the direct or indirect stockholders of such Parent Third Party or the resulting company, acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, or would otherwise own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing more than 20% or more of the equity or voting power of Parent (or the resulting company), in each case, on a fully diluted basis, (2) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any Parent Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (3) any transaction pursuant to which any Parent Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of Parent and any entity surviving any merger or combination including any of them) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (4) any disposition of assets to a Parent Third Party representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  For purposes of this Agreement, a “Parent Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Parent Third Party after the date of this Agreement to enter into a Parent Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of Parent Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) that (A) did not result from a breach of this Section 6.4 (other than any breach that is immaterial in scope and effect), (B) is on terms that the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to be superior from a financial point of view to Parent’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account any changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by Parent in response to such proposal to enter into a Parent Alternative Transaction, the identity of the person making such proposal to enter into a Parent Alternative Transaction and such other factors as the Parent Board considers to be appropriate or relevant, including the timing, likelihood of consummation, financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, and (C) is reasonably likely to be completed in accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, and is not subject to a diligence or financing condition. -43-

Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall cause or permit Parent or any of its controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any Parent Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.4(a)).

(e)          Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit Parent from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder; provided that any such disclosure or statement that constitutes or contains a Parent Recommendation Change shall be subject to the provisions of Section 6.4(b). 


(f)          From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent and its officers and directors will, will cause Parent’s Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors to, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the other Representatives of Parent and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease, and cause to be terminated, any discussion or negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives with respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Alternative Transaction (including by approving any transaction, or approving any Person becoming an “interested stockholder,” for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL).

(ii)          no Party shall have access to personnel records of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information that in the other Party’s good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability;

In addition, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform and consult with the other in advance of any meeting, conference or communication with any Governmental Entity or any official, representative or staff thereof, or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private party in respect of any Antitrust Laws, with any other person, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity or other person, not participate or attend any meeting or conference, or engage in any communication, with any Governmental Entity or any official, representative or staff thereof or such other person in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or by the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement without the other Party unless it reasonably consults with the other Party in advance and gives the other Party a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate therein, and in the event one Party is prohibited from, or unable to participate, attend or engage in, any such meeting, conference or communication, keep such Party apprised with respect thereto.  Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly furnish to the other copies of all filings, submissions, correspondence and communications between it and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or any official, representative or staff thereof (or any other person in connection with any Proceeding initiated by a private party in respect of any Antitrust Laws), on the other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, and in the case of any written communications with any Governmental Entity set forth on Section 7.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, each Party shall copy the other Party on all such written communications.

(c)          The Parties shall consult and cooperate in all respects with each other, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party with respect to obtaining all consents, approvals, licenses, permits, waivers, orders and authorizations necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, including the Merger. 


(d)          Each of Parent and, if requested by Parent, the Company, along with their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, shall take any and all actions and steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or private party and otherwise to satisfy any closing conditions relating to any Antitrust Law contained in this Agreement so as to enable the consummation of the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, giving undertakings in lieu or otherwise, to sell, divest, hold separate, lease, license, transfer, dispose of, otherwise encumber or impair or take any other action with respect to Parent’s or any of its Affiliates’ ability to own or operate any assets, properties, contracts, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its Affiliates or any assets, properties, contracts, businesses or product lines of the Company or any of its Affiliates (individually or collectively, “Remedial Actions”) and (ii) in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other decree, order, judgment, writ, stipulation, award or temporary restraining order (an “Order”) in any Proceeding by or with any Governmental Entity is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered that would make consummation of the Transactions unlawful or that would otherwise prevent or delay consummation of the Transactions, taking any and all steps (including the posting of a bond, commencement, contesting and defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (i) above) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such Order; provided that no Party shall be required pursuant to this Section 6.8 to commit to or effect any Remedial Action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.  The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other and work in good faith to develop the strategy relating to any Remedial Actions and in connection with the process of effecting (including negotiating or committing to effect) any Remedial Actions, including any divestiture process and any communications with potential divestiture buyers relating thereto.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent is not and will not be required to commit to or effect any sale, divestiture, lease, holding separate pending a sale or other transfer or disposal, or any other Remedial Action contemplated by this Section 6.8(d) if any or all such Remedial Actions, in the aggregate would or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) from and after the Effective Time (but, for purposes of determining whether any effect is material, calculated as if Parent and its Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time were collectively the same size as the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) (a “Burdensome Condition”). 


(e)          Each of the Parties agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, it shall not, and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries shall, consummate, enter into any agreement providing for, or announce, any investment, acquisition, divestiture or other business combination that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. -51-

6.9 Employee Matters. 


(a)          For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide to each individual who is employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (a “Company Employee”), for so long as such Company Employee remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries, (i) base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than was provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash incentive opportunities and target annual equity incentive opportunities that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than were provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that Parent may provide cash-based compensation in lieu of equity incentive compensation and (iii) employee benefits (excluding defined benefit pension, retiree medical, severance, retention and change in control benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits (excluding defined benefit pension, retiree medical, severance, retention and change in control benefits) provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that Parent may reduce any element of such Company Employee’s compensation, compensation opportunity, or benefits to the extent that such reduction applies on a uniform basis to other similarly situated employees of Parent and is implemented as a result of extraordinary circumstances impacting Parent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to any applicable release of claims requirements, Parent shall provide each Company Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated during the Continuation Period, severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits (if any) that would have been payable to such Company Employee under the Company Plan set forth on Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter as in effect on the date hereof. 


(b)          From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, credit the Company Employees for purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual under the Parent Plans (other than with respect to any “defined benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, retiree medical benefits, frozen or grandfathered plan, or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits) in which the Company Employees participate, for such Company Employees’ service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into account under a corresponding Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date. 


(c)          From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, with respect to each Company Employee who becomes eligible to participate in a Parent Plan that is a group health plan, (i) waive any limitation on coverage of such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under such Parent Plan to the extent such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents were covered under a comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and such conditions, periods or requirements were satisfied or waived under such Company Plan and (ii) to the extent that such eligibility commences during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, give such Company Employee credit under such Parent Plan for such plan year towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which payment has been made under a comparable Company Plan, in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan provider. 


(d)          If the Effective Time occurs prior to the date in 2022 that annual bonus payments in respect of calendar year 2021 are paid to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice pursuant to the Company’s annual cash bonus plans listed on Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the “Annual Cash Bonus Plan”) and any such payment, an “Annual Cash Bonus”), then Parent shall pay to each Company Employee who participates in the Annual Cash Bonus Plan and (i) remains actively employed through the last day of calendar year 2021 or (ii) experiences a Qualifying Termination of employment prior to the last day of calendar year 2021, an Annual Cash Bonus in respect of calendar year 2021 pursuant to the Annual Cash Bonus Plan with performance deemed achieved at 100% of the target level.  “Qualifying Termination” shall have the meaning set forth on Section 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter. -52-

(e)          Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing at least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall adopt resolutions and take all such corporate action as is necessary to terminate each 401(k) plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company 401(k) Plans”), in each case, effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plans have been properly terminated, with the form of such termination documents subject to the prior review and comment of Parent (which comments shall be considered in good faith by the Company).  To the extent the Company 401(k) Plans are terminated pursuant to Parent’s request, the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries on the day after the Closing Date, and such Company Employees shall be entitled to effect a direct rollover of any eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code), including any outstanding loans, to such 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries. 


(f)          Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.  The provisions of this Section 6.9 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any third-party beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.9) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (i) from amending or terminating any of their respective Employee Benefit Plans or, after the Effective Time, any Company Plan in accordance with their terms or (ii) from terminating the employment of any Company Employee. 


6.10 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. 


(a)          Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Plan, in each case, when acting in such capacity (the “Indemnified Persons”) against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Plan or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise, as applicable, or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to or at, but not after, the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (“Indemnified Liabilities”), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred in connection therewith in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding that constitutes Transaction Litigation is brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the Company’s regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter.  Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.10, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices Parent or the Surviving Corporation’s position with respect to such claims).  With respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.10, such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by Parent or Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services for Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last three (3) years. -53-

(b)          For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would) adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Person (or any employee of the Company, with respect to periods prior to the Effective Time) to indemnification, exculpation and advancement, except to the extent required by applicable Law.  Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its directors or officers existing and in effect prior to the date of this Agreement and set forth on Schedule 6.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 


(c)          In furtherance of and not in limitation of Section 6.10(a) and Section 6.10(b), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided in Section 6.10(a), relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Person’s rights under this Section 6.10 or under any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder. 


(d)          Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (and, if the Company is unable to, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place as of the Closing and shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Closing) “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time (the “Tail Period”) from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in an amount and scope and containing terms and conditions at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to, but not after, the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the D&O Insurance exceed during the Tail Period 300% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for such purpose; and provided, further, that if the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 


(e)          In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assignees (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy their obligations under this Section 6.10.  The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties and each Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 6.10, and his or her heirs and Representatives.  The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.10 are in addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or Law.  Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.10. -54-

Without limiting in any way any Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give any Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party and their respective Subsidiaries’ operations prior to the Effective Time.

(a)          Parent will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof in an amount, together with any available cash of the Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, sufficient to satisfy all Required Uses, on or prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, including by using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing (the “Definitive Agreements”) on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the flex provisions contained in any related fee letter) or, subject to the Prohibited Financing Modifications, on other terms reasonably acceptable to Parent, and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements that are applicable to Parent and within Parent’s control and complying with Parent’s obligations thereunder (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of such conditions contained in such Debt Commitment Letter or such Definitive Agreements). Parent shall enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements in a timely and diligent manner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, in the event that all conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements (other than the consummation of the Merger) have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Entities party to the Debt Commitment Letter to comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including to fund the Financing. Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, without the prior written consent of the Company, permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) adds new or modifies any existing conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing, (ii) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing, (iii) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, modified or waived, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (iv) would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date pursuant to the terms hereof (the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, the “Prohibited Financing Modifications”). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (which may, in the case of fee letters, be redacted as to fees, yield or interest rate caps, original issue discount amounts, economic terms, flex terms and successful syndication level and other terms that are customarily redacted in connection with transactions of this type and would not in any event affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or principal amount of the Financing). At the Company’s written and reasonable request, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonable basis and -56-

in reasonable detail of the status of Parent’s efforts to arrange such Financing.  Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of, or receiving written notice with respect to, any material breach of or default under, or any event or circumstance that (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach of or default under, the Debt Commitment Letter by a party thereto or any termination, withdrawal or rescission of the Debt Commitment Letter; provided that none of Parent or Merger Sub shall be required to disclose or provide any such information, the disclosure of which, in the judgement of Parent upon advice of outside counsel, is subject to attorney-client privilege; provided, further that, subject to not violating attorney-client privilege, Parent or Merger Sub shall notify the Company of the withholding thereof and use reasonable best efforts to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Financing and any available cash of the Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, to satisfy the Required Uses) from the same or other sources that does not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (provided, that in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to pay any fees or any interest rates applicable to the Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter (including the flex provisions)) and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor.  Parent shall provide written notice to the Company no later than one (1) Business Day after the date on which a “Successful Syndication” (as defined in the Arranger Fee Letter) shall have occurred. 


(b)          The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives, to provide such customary assistance in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (which term, for purposes of this Section, shall include any alternative financing obtained by Parent in the event any portion of the Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter becomes unavailable) as is reasonably requested by Parent in writing and does not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such assistance in any event shall include: 


(i)          using reasonable best efforts to assist with Parent’s preparation of customary confidential information memoranda and lender presentations; 


(ii)          upon reasonable prior notice and at times and locations to be reasonably and mutually agreed, using reasonable best efforts to cause senior management of the Company to participate in, and assist with Parent’s preparation of, rating agency presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and a reasonable number of meetings with prospective lenders and ratings agencies; provided that such participation by senior management of the Company may be conducted by video conference at the Company’s option; 


(iii)          delivery to Parent and its Financing Entities of all documentation and other information reasonably requested by the Financing Entities required by regulatory authorities under applicable “know-your-customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act (in any case at least four (4) business days prior to the Closing Date, to the extent requested in writing at least nine (9) days prior to the Closing Date); 


(iv)          (A) delivery to Parent and its Financing Entities of the Required Information and (B) using reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent and its Financing Entities any other information relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their businesses customary or reasonably necessary in connection with the Financing to the extent reasonably requested by Parent; 


(v)          informing Parent if the Company shall have knowledge (A) of any facts that would likely require the restatement of any financial statements included in the information required by clause (iv) above for such financial statements to comply with GAAP or (B) that the information provided pursuant to clause (iv) above contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading under the circumstances under which such statements were made; -57-

(d)          Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between the Company and Parent (or its Affiliates), the Company agrees that Parent and its Affiliates may share customary projections and other non-public information with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company on a customary basis with its Financing Entities, and that Parent, its Affiliates and such Financing Entities may share such information with potential Financing Entities in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with the Financing; provided that the recipients of such written information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements (including through customary “click-through” confidentiality undertakings) which require such recipients to hold such information confidentially. 


(e)          Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 6.17, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 6.17 that: (1) would require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are officers or directors of the Company or the any of its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing or enter into, execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement (other than customary authorization or representation letters as set forth in clause (b)(viii) above), (2) would cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company (unless Parent waives such breach prior to the Company or its Subsidiaries taking such action), (3) would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing, in each case for which Parent is not obligated to reimburse or indemnify the Company or its Subsidiaries under this Agreement (or otherwise previously reimbursed), (4) would cause any director, officer or employee or equityholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (5) would conflict with the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as in effect on the date hereof) or any applicable Laws, subject to not violating such organizational documents or applicable Law, the Company shall notify Parent of the withholding thereof and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information, (6) would reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any material contract existing as of the date hereof to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, subject to not breaching any material existing contract, the Company shall notify Parent of the withholding thereof and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information, (7) would require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives to provide access to or disclose information that is legally privileged (provided, however, that, subject to not violating attorney-client privilege, the Company shall notify Parent of the withholding thereof and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information) or (8) would require the Company or any of its representatives to prepare any financial statements (other than the Required Information) that are not prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice.

Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, in response to an order from a court or other competent authority for any Party to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or required hereby, to the extent that a Party took an action inconsistent with this Agreement or failed to take action consistent with this Agreement or required by this Agreement pursuant to such order, such Party shall not incur any liability or obligation unless such Party did not in good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition or entering of such order.

Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 9.9 shall be void. 


9.10          Specific Performance.  The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Parties.  It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this Section 9.10, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity.  Each Party accordingly agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.10.  Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.10, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. 


9.11          Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time before or after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, but, after any such stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made which by law would require the further approval by the applicable stockholders without first obtaining such further approval.

(c)          waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other Party contained herein.

No agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

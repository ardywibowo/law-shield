Section 2.03          Conversion and Cancellation of Shares in the Merger.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Company Common Stock, the common stock of Merger Sub: 


(a)          other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.03(b) (the “Excluded Shares”), each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into, and shall thereafter represent only, the right to receive, 0.396 (the “Exchange Ratio”) Parent ADSs (the “Merger Consideration”), subject to Section 2.08 with respect to fractional Parent ADSs, and immediately following such conversion, shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist (the “Cancellation”); 20








________________


(b)          (i) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of other Persons, whether or not held in a separate account) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent ADSs equal to the Exchange Ratio; 


(c)          each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation; and 


(d)          all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each share of Company Common Stock that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented by a certificate (each, a “Certificate”) and (ii) each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (an “Uncertificated Share”) shall (in each case, other than with respect to Excluded Shares) thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.04(f), to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.04, without interest. 


Section 2.04          Surrender and Payment. 


(a)          Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent Agreement”) for the purpose of exchanging (i) Certificates or (ii) Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock.  As of the Effective Time, in consideration of and in exchange for the Cancellation, Parent shall deposit with the ADS Depositary Parent Ordinary Shares underlying the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a).  As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.04 through the Exchange Agent, the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.  For the avoidance of doubt, any stamp duty liability arising in connection with the deposit of Parent ADSs with the Exchange Agent will be payable by Parent.  Parent agrees to make available, directly or indirectly, to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(f).  Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and substantially finalized prior to the Effective Time and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only on proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.  All certificates (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form) and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be referred to in this Agreement as the “Exchange Fund”.  Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that such cash shall only be invested in the manner provided in the Exchange Agent Agreement.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent on termination of the Exchange Fund. 21

(b)          Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, within five Business Days of the later to occur of (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of the Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share (including any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.04(f)).  The Parent ADSs constituting the Merger Consideration, at Parent’s option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical American depositary receipt evidencing such Parent ADSs is requested by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law. 


(c)          If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.04(f)) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable. 


(d)          From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration (and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.04(f)) with respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth in, or as otherwise contemplated by, this Article II (including this Section 2.04). 22








________________


(e)          Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock 12 months following the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration (and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.04(f)), without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official in compliance with applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(f)          Following the surrender of any Certificates, along with the delivery of a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or the transfer of any Uncertificated Shares, in each case as provided in this Section 2.04, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent ADSs constituting the Merger Consideration have been registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the Merger Consideration, the aggregate amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent ADSs, with a record date on or after the Effective Time that were paid prior to the time of such surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole Parent ADSs constituting the Merger Consideration with a record date on or after the Effective Time and prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer.  No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent ADSs constituting the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates are surrendered and the holder thereof delivers a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or such or Uncertificated Shares are transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.04. 


Section 2.05          Dissenters’ Rights.  No dissenters’ or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 


Section 2.06          Company Equity Awards; Company Warrants. 


(a)          Company Stock Options.  At the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company Stock Option”), whether or not vested shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to purchase Parent ADSs (each, an “Assumed Stock Option”), on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof provided for in the relevant Company Employee Plan or in the related award document by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.  The number of Parent ADSs subject to each such Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number of Parent ADSs, and such Assumed Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent ADS (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided, that in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time (taking into account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of Parent ADSs subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; provided further, that in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 409A of the Code applies as of the Effective Time, the exercise price, the number of Parent ADSs subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code in order to avoid the imposition of any additional taxes thereunder. 23








________________


(b)          Company Restricted Stock Units.  At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests solely based on the passage of time (each, a “Company RSU Award”) shall be treated as set forth in this Section 2.06(b). 


(i)          To the extent a Company RSU Award becomes vested in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Employee Plan, restricted stock unit award agreement or other agreements between the Company and the award holder, a number of shares of Company Common Stock determined in accordance therewith will be issued to the award holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each such share will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Common Stock described in Section 2.03 above. 


(ii)          The Company shall take all necessary action to provide that each Company RSU Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time after giving effect to Section 2.06(b)(i) above shall, effective as of the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award which shall represent the right to acquire Parent ADSs (each, an “Assumed RSU Award”), on the same terms and conditions (including any accelerated vesting on a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger) as were applicable under such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.  The number of Parent ADSs subject to each such Assumed RSU Award shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number of Parent ADSs. 24

(c)          Board Actions.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company and of Parent (and/or the applicable committees thereof) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.06. 


(d)          Company ESPP.  As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required so that (i) participation in the Company ESPP shall be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement, (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the Company ESPP as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, participants may not increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement or make any separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement, (iii) no offering period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, and (iv) the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective on the earlier of the first purchase date following the date of this Agreement or the fifth trading day before the Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP). 


(e)          Registration on Form S-8.  On or as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall register the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Assumed Stock Options and Assumed RSU Awards on a registration statement on Form S-8 (if such Form is available). 


(f)          Company Warrants.  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a “Company Warrant”) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not exercised or expired pursuant to its terms at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, shall be deemed to be net exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and the shares of Company Common Stock issued to such holder of Company Warrant upon such net exercise immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Common Stock described in Section 2.03 above. 


Section 2.07          Adjustments.  Without limiting or affecting any of the provisions of Section 6.01 or Section 6.02, if, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Parent ADSs or outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares in respect thereof shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger, offer (as defined in the U.K. Code), combination, scheme, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and/or Company Equity Awards with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 25








________________


Section 2.08          Fractional ADSs.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional Parent ADSs shall be issued in the Merger.  Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the Merger a fraction of a Parent ADS (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, in the aggregate that number of whole Parent ADSs resulting from the application of the Exchange Ratio as described in Section 2.03 or Section 2.06 as is rounded to the nearest whole Parent ADS, with no cash being paid for any fractional Parent ADSs eliminated by such rounding. 


Section 2.09          Withholding Rights.  Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law.  To the extent amounts so deducted and withheld are paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the deduction and withholding were made. 


Section 2.10          Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, on the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a customary bond issued for lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificates, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, if such holder has otherwise delivered a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II (including Section 2.04).

Subject to Section 10.05, except (a) as disclosed in any Parent Public Document filed or furnished and publicly available since January 1, 2020 and prior to the date that was one Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement (only to the extent that the relevance of any disclosure in such Parent Public Document is reasonably apparent as to matters which are a subject of such representation or warranty, and other than any matters required to be disclosed for purposes of Section 5.02 (Corporate Authorization) or Section 5.05 (Capitalization), which matters shall only be disclosed by specific disclosure in the respective corresponding section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule) or (b) as set forth in the Parent’s Disclosure Schedule, Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company that: 


Section 5.01          Corporate Existence and Power.  Parent is a public limited company duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of England and Wales, and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority required to own or lease all of its properties or assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (a) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (b) prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified has not had, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  Parent indirectly owns all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub.  Merger Sub has not, since the date of its incorporation engaged in any activities other than (i) in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) those incident or related to its incorporation.

The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast, in the case of the Parent Share Issuance Approval, and the affirmative vote of at least seventy five percent (75%) of the votes cast, in the case of the Parent Board Size Approval, in each case by the holders of outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares at a duly convened and held meeting of Parent’s shareholders at which a quorum is present approving the resolution granting the Parent Share Issuance Approval and the Parent Board Size Approval, respectively, are the only votes of Parent’s shareholders necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company) constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions). 49








________________


(b)          At a meeting duly convened and held, the Board of Directors of Parent resolved (i) that this Agreement and the Merger would most likely promote the success of Parent for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole, (ii) that the Parent Share Issuance Approval and the Parent Board Size Approval be put to Parent’s shareholders at a meeting of Parent’s shareholders, and (iii) to recommend that Parent’s shareholders vote in favor of the Parent Share Issuance Approval and the Parent Board Size Approval (such recommendation, the “Parent Board Recommendation”). 


(c)          The Board of Directors of Merger Sub has adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) are fair to and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its stockholder, (ii) approving, adopting and declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), (iii) directing that the approval and adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote of its stockholder, and (iv) recommending approval and adoption of this Agreement by its stockholder.

The execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, Consents of, or Filings with, any Governmental Authority other than (a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which Parent or Merger Sub is qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, (c) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other applicable U.S. state or federal securities laws or pursuant to the CA 2006, the DTRs, the MAR, the FSMA, the U.K. Code or the rules of Nasdaq or the AIM Rules and (d) any other actions, Consents or Filings the absence of which (i) has not had, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger. 


Section 5.04          Non-contravention.  Assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03 and receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, the execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the Parent Organizational Documents or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Merger Sub, (b) contravene, conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (c) require any Consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under, any provision of any Contract binding on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of clauses (b) through (d), as (i) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger. 50

(a)          From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) in each case to the fullest extent permissible by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an “Indemnitee” and, collectively, the “Indemnitees”) with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action based on or arising out of (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a representative of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case of clauses (A) and (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii) assume (in the case of the Surviving Corporation, in the Merger without any further action) all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in the agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnitee.  Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are in the Company Organizational Documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.  In addition, from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 7.13 as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.13. 95








________________


(b)          Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate to the extent reasonably practicable in the defense of any claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. 


(c)          For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals who are covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a “tail” policy); provided that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the “Maximum Premium”).  The Company shall have the right prior to the Effective Time to purchase a six-year prepaid “tail policy” on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby, so long as the effective annual premium under such policy does not exceed the Maximum Premium.  If such prepaid “tail policy” has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 7.13 and the Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder. 


(d)          The provisions of this Section 7.13 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the Company Organizational Documents, by contract or otherwise.  The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.13 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 7.13 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification.  The Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.13 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.13. The Surviving Corporation agrees to (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay or advance, upon written request of the Indemnitee, all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other rights provided in this Section 7.13; provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.13. 96

(f)          The Parties agree and understand that (x) in no event shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Payment or the Parent Termination Payment, respectively, on more than one occasion or the Company No Vote Payment or the Parent No Vote Payment, respectively, on more than one occasion, in each case under any circumstances, and the Company No Vote Payment or the Parent No Vote Payment, respectively, shall be credited toward any subsequent payment of the Company Termination Payment or the Parent Termination Payment, respectively, and (y) except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach by the other Party of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent be entitled, pursuant to this Section 9.03, to receive an amount greater than the Company Termination Payment and Company No Vote Payment, as applicable (subject to the understanding that the Company No Vote Payment is set off against the Company Termination Payment when the payment of the Company Termination Payment follows the payment of the Company No Vote Payment under Section 9.03(c)), and any applicable additional amounts pursuant to the last two sentences of this Section 9.03(f) (such additional amounts, collectively, the “Parent Additional Amounts”), and in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to this Section 9.03, to receive an amount greater than the Parent Termination Payment and Parent No Vote Payment, as applicable (subject to the understanding that the Parent No Vote Payment is set off against the Parent Termination Payment when the payment of the Parent Termination Payment follows the payment of the Parent No Vote Payment under Section 9.03(d)), and any applicable additional amounts pursuant to the last two sentences of this Section 9.03(f) (such additional amounts, collectively, the “Company Additional Amounts”).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach by the other Party of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, if Parent receives a Company Termination Payment and any applicable Parent Additional Amounts from the Company pursuant to this Section 9.03, or if the Company receives the Parent Termination Payment and any applicable Company Additional Amounts from Parent pursuant to this Section 9.03, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving Party against the paying Party and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives, and none of the paying Party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation, in each case relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 9.03 do not constitute a penalty.  Accordingly, if any Party fails to promptly pay any Company Payment or the Parent Payment due pursuant to this Section 9.03, such Party shall also pay any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (together with any irrecoverable VAT incurred thereon, and including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Party entitled to such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against the Party failing to promptly pay such amount.  Any Company Payment or Parent Payment not paid when due pursuant to this Section 9.03 shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the date of such payment. 104

(h)          The Parties hereto intend that any payment of a Parent Payment or Company Payment, being compensatory in nature, shall not be treated (in whole or in part) as consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT and, accordingly, the Parties shall (i) file their relevant VAT returns on the basis that the payment of any such Parent Payment or Company Payment falls outside the scope of VAT; and (ii) pay the full amount of any such Parent Payment or Company Payment free and clear of any deduction, adjustment or additional amount on account of VAT.

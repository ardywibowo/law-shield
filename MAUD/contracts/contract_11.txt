AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 


THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 23, 2021 (this “Agreement”), is by and between Columbia Banking System, Inc., a Washington corporation (“Parent”) and Bank of Commerce Holdings, a California corporation (the “Company”).

B. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company will merge with and into Parent (the “Merger”), with Parent as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “Surviving Corporation”). 


C.

F. As an inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Randall S.

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the applicable Laws of the State of Washington and the applicable laws of the State of California at the Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its existence under the Laws of the State of Washington. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease. 


1.2 Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on or before the Closing Date, the parties will execute and cause articles of merger (“Washington Articles of Merger”) to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington (“Washington Secretary”) as provided in Section 23B.11.050 of the Revised Code of Washington (“RCW”) and a copy of an officers’ certificate and other necessary documents (“California Merger Filings”) relating to the Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California (“California Secretary”) as provided in Section 1108 of the California General Corporation Law (“CGCL”). The Merger shall become effective at such time as such certificates of merger have been filed, or at such other time as may be specified therein. The term “Effective Time” shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective in accordance therewith. 


1.3 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable Laws of the State of Washington and applicable Laws of the State of California. 


1.4 Conversion of Stock At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company or Parent or the shareholders of any of the foregoing: 


(a) Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock excluding Treasury Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to any adjustments pursuant to Sections 1.4(f)(ii) and 8.1(e) (the “Merger Consideration”) and subject to the payment of any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f). At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. 


(b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Company or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than those held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) (“Treasury Shares”), shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time of the Merger and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.   -2-








________________


(c) Outstanding Parent Stock. (i) Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Parent Common Stock and shall not be affected by the Merger. (ii) Each share of Parent Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Parent Preferred Stock and shall not be affected by the Merger.

“Determination Period” means the period beginning on the day that is twenty (20) consecutive Nasdaq trading days prior to the Determination Date and ending on the Determination Date. 


“Exchange Ratio” means, subject to any adjustments pursuant to Sections 1.4(f)(ii) and 8.1(e), 0.40 of a share of Parent Common Stock per each share of Company Common Stock; 


“Final Index Price” means the average closing prices of the Index as quoted on Nasdaq.com (KRX) during the Determination Period. 


“Index” means the KBW Regional Banking Index.

(e) Effect of Conversion. All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) and each non-certificated share of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Share”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares, into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(c).   -3-








________________


(f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. (i) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio. (ii) If, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Transaction Expenses exceed the Threshold Amount, there shall be an adjustment made to the Exchange Ratio such that the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 1.4(d) multiplied by (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Aggregate Merger Consideration minus the Reduction Amount by (2) the Aggregate Merger Consideration. For the purposes hereof, “Threshold Amount” means $10,500,000, provided that the Threshold Amount shall be $10,750,000 if the Closing Date is in calendar year 2022; “Aggregate Merger Consideration” shall equal the product of (A) the Per Share Value multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (other than Treasury Shares), and “Reduction Amount” shall mean, to the extent the Transaction Expenses exceed the Threshold Amount, an amount equal to (A) the Transaction Expenses minus (B) the Threshold Amount plus (C) any Tax benefits estimated to result from the Transaction Expenses exceeding the Threshold Amount, as reasonably estimated by Parent; provided, however, that in the event of a transaction or series of related transactions in which a Person, or more than one Person acting as a group, acquires record or beneficial ownership of Parent Common Stock that, together with stock held by such Person or group, constitutes greater than 50% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, the Reduction Amount shall be zero. 


1.5 Company Restricted Stock Awards. At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding share of restricted stock (a “Company Restricted Share”) under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (together, the “Company Stock Plans”) shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and each Company Restricted Share shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Restricted Share to receive the Merger Consideration (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld), pursuant to Article II.   -4-








________________


1.6 Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option award to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a “Company Stock Option”) granted under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to receive (without interest), no later than the first payroll period following the Effective Time and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days following the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Cashout Price over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option which has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Equity Award Cashout Price shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Equity Award Cashout Price” means an amount equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio as it may be adjusted pursuant to Sections 1.4(g)(ii) and 8.1(e) multiplied by (y) the Parent Average Closing Price for the Determination Period. 


1.7 Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (x) effectuate the treatment of the Company Restricted Shares and Company Stock Options (the “Company Equity Awards”) pursuant to Sections 1.5 through 1.6, including delivering written notice to each holder of a Company Equity Award of the treatment of such award not less than 20 days prior to the expected time of the Closing and (y) cause the Company Stock Plans to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards. 


1.8 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Parent (the “Parent Articles”), as then in effect, will be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Parent (the “Parent Bylaws”), as then in effect, will be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 


1.9 Parent Board of Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent (the “Parent Board”) shall consist of the persons serving on the Board of Directors of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Parent shall be the officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such officers shall hold office until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 


1.10 Bank Merger. Promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger, in accordance with the applicable Laws of Washington and the applicable Laws of California, Merchants Bank will be merged with and into Columbia Bank in the Bank Merger, with Columbia Bank surviving the Bank Merger and continuing its existence   -5-








________________


under the Laws of the State of Washington, and the separate corporate existence of Merchants Bank ceasing as of the effective time of the Bank Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties shall execute and cause to be filed applicable articles or certificates of merger and such other documents as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective promptly following the Effective Time. 


1.11 Change in Structure. Subject to the proviso in the first sentence of Section 8.4, Parent may at any time, but with the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, change the method of effecting the combination contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax consequences to shareholders of the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) impede or delay in any material respect consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 


ARTICLE II DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION 


2.1 Delivery of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent, which Person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”), pursuant to an agreement (the “Exchange Agent Agreement”) entered into prior to the Effective Time, (a) shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.4(a) and Section 1.5, plus, (b) to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f) (such amount in cash and Parent Common Stock, the “Exchange Fund”). 


2.2 Exchange Procedures. 


(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 or Section 1.5 (“Exchanged Shares”), along with, in each case, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the “Letter of Transmittal”)) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) or Book- Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).   -6-








________________


(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Exchanged Shares will be entitled to receive promptly after such surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the Exchanged Shares represented by its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II. 


(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and paid prior to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. 


(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing Exchanged Shares that are not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, the shares of Parent Common Stock plus any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such Exchanged Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that the tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Exchanged Shares such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. If, prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent or Parent determines that any such deduction or withholding is so required as of the   -7-








________________


Effective Time, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, shall notify the Company and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Exchanged Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be. 


(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of such Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing any such shares of Company Common Stock are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. 


(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. 


(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company as of the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time will be transferred to Parent. In such event, any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.   -8-

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

No representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article III (other than the representations and warranties in Sections 3.2, 3.3(b) and 3.8, which shall be true and correct in all respects with respect to it) shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and the Company shall not be deemed to have breached any representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with such representation or warranty contained in Article III, would cause the representation or warranty not to be true in all material respects. Subject to the foregoing, except (a) as disclosed in any report, schedule, form or other document filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company prior to the date hereof which is publicly available (without giving effect to any amendment thereof filed with or furnished to the SEC after the date hereof, and disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading “Risk Factors,” or disclosure of risks set forth in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (b) as Previously Disclosed, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 3.1 Corporate Organization. 


(a) Organization. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of California. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary. The Company is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”). 


(b) Articles and Bylaws. True, complete and correct copies of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the “Company Articles”), and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the “Company Bylaws”), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been publicly filed by the Company and made available to Parent.

As used in this Agreement, the term “Subsidiary” has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 2(d) of the BHC Act, except that when such term is used with respect to an entity that is not a bank holding company, the meaning shall nonetheless be deemed to apply to such entity.

True, complete and correct copies of the articles of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing documents of each Subsidiary of the Company as in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement have been provided to Parent. Other than the Subsidiaries of the Company, and shares or interests acquired pursuant to security interests owned by or in favor of a Subsidiary created in the ordinary course of business thereof, the Company does not, directly or indirectly, beneficially own any equity securities or similar interests of any entity or any interests of any entity or any interest in a partnership or joint venture of any kind.

(b) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities.

The Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws, all the non-confidential information relating to the Company or Parent (excluding any confidential financial information relating to individuals), as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to the Company’s shareholders and at the time of the Company Special Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading. Each of Parent and the Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as applicable. 


(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be likely, in each case following the Effective Time (but regardless when the action, condition or restriction is to be taken or implemented), to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (measured on a scale relative to the Company) or a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or materially restrict or impose a material burden on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or with respect to the business or operation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) (a “Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition”). 


(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed. 


6.2 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent agrees to cooperate with the other and use its reasonable best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable on its part under this Agreement or under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers, and the other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof.

Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall furnish such reasonable information about it and its business as is reasonably relevant to the Company and its shareholders in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information to the extent such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. In addition to the foregoing, on an every other week basis, the Company shall provide Parent with a listing of all new and renewed loans and loan modifications, loan payoffs and loan purchases in the preceding two weeks.

Subject to Sections 6.9(b) and (c), the Company Board shall at all times prior to and during such Company Special Meeting recommend such approval and shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit such approval by its shareholders (the “Company Board Recommendation”).

The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting; provided that the Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting (A) if on the date on which the Company Special Meeting is originally scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company shall adjourn the Company Special Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent, which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Company Shareholder Approval, (B) after consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or (C) after consultation with Parent, for a single period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Parent may require the Company to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Special Meeting once for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days (but prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Once the Company has established the record date, in respect of the Company Special Meeting (the “Company Record Date”), the Company shall not change such Company Record Date or establish a different Company Record Date for the Company Special Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws.

Disclosure Schedules; provided, however, that until such time as Parent shall cause Continuing Employees to participate in the benefit plans of Parent, a Continuing Employee’s continued participation in the Employee Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provision of this sentence (it being understood that participation in Parent benefit plans may commence at different times with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan). 


(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee’s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such service had been performed with Parent, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. 


(c) If requested in writing by Parent at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective not later than the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, any Employee Benefit Plans that contain a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code; provided that such actions are in compliance with applicable Law. In the event that Parent requests that such plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan(s) has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, approval of which shall not be unreasonably withheld) not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 


(d) From and after the date hereof, prior to making any written or oral communications to officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation, benefit or other employment-related matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication or talking points, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication. 


(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining   -55-

6.7 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. 


(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable documented attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent they are indemnified by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date hereof, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. 


(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent will provide director’s and officer’s liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) (providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for the Company) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall the Parent be required to expend in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period, an amount in excess of 250% of the aggregate annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for any such insurance; provided, further, that if Parent are unable to maintain or obtain the D&O Insurance called for by this Section 6.7(b), Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period up to 250% of the current annual premium; provided, further, that officers and directors of the Company may be required to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to Parent’s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such D&O Insurance.

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.7(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, will promptly notify Parent thereof; provided that failure to so notify will not affect the obligations of Parent under Section 6.7(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence. 


(d) In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay all reasonable documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Parent shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (d) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; provided that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent; and provided, further, that Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. 


6.8 Exemption from Liability Under Rule 16(b)-3. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 


6.9 No Solicitation; Change in Company Board Recommendation. 


(a) The Company agrees that none of it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors and employees will, and will cause its and its Subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, representatives, advisors and Affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any Company Acquisition Proposal or otherwise facilitate any effort to attempt or make or implement a Company Acquisition Proposal.   -57-

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time after the date hereof and prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably expected to result in, a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and the Company Board may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso or engaging in any negotiations, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less restrictive in the aggregate to the counterparty than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and which expressly permits the Company to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.9. Subject to the foregoing and Section 6.9(c) below, the Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted on or before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Parent with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable Law, to (i) enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality or similar agreement. The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, of any discussions or negotiations that are sought to be initiated or continued or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent promptly apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of any such request, inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal, or all amendments or proposed amendments thereto) on a current basis (it being understood that no such communications to Parent shall be deemed a Company Adverse Change of Recommendation). The Company agrees that it shall contemporaneously provide to Parent any confidential or nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be provided to any other Person in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal which has not previously been provided to Parent.   -58-

(c) (i) None of the Company Board or any committee thereof shall: (A) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section 6.9(c)(ii)(B) hereof, make any Company Adverse Change of Recommendation; or (B) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.9(b) entered into in compliance with Section 6.9(b)) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal made to the Company. (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) if the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and the Company Board concludes in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; provided that: (A) the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (B) the Company provides Parent prior written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to taking such action, which notice shall state that the Company Board has received a Company Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has resolved to effect a Company Adverse Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), as applicable, which notice shall specify the basis for such Company Adverse Change of Recommendation or termination, including the material terms of the Company Superior Proposal (a “Notice of Superior Proposal”) (it being understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Change of Recommendation); (C) during such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to make an improved offer that is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company so that such Company Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Company Superior Proposal; and (D) at the end of such five (5)-Business Day period (or such earlier time that Parent advises the Company that it no longer wishes to negotiate to amend this Agreement), the Company Board, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by Parent after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.   -59-

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, “Company Acquisition Proposal” means a tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15% of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any public announcement of a proposed plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreements to engage in any of the foregoing, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary course. As used in this Agreement, “Company Superior Proposal” means an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking or financial advisory firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable Law, and after taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement agreed to by Parent; provided that for purposes of the definition of “Company Superior Proposal,” the references to “more than 15%” in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “at least 50%.” 


6.10 Takeover Laws. No party will take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Laws become applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger, the parties shall take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

6.12 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to a failure of a condition in Article VII. 


6.13 Pass It On Project. Upon Closing or promptly thereafter, Parent shall extend its Pass It On Project (www.passitonproject.com) to the Northern California market and contribute $500,000 to be paid to small businesses in that market to provide a service for those in need. 


6.14 Company Trust Preferred Securities, FHLB Borrowings and Subordinated Debentures. At the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it shall expressly assume all of the Company’s obligations in connection with the (i) trust preferred securities of Bank of Commerce Holdings Trust II, a Delaware trust affiliate of the Company (“BOCH Trust II”), pursuant to the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated July 29, 2005, by and between the Company, as sponsor, Chase Bank USA, N.A. and J.P.

Among other things, the Company shall: (i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project plan to effectuate the conversion;

9.10 Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

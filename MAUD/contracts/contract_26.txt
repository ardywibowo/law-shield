securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock or the Company Equity Awards occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 


(c)    Statutory Rights of Appraisal. (i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all Shares that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL subject to any required withholding of Taxes, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become cancelled and exchanged for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.10. (ii)    The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

2.8    Equity Awards. 


(a)    Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in each case, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash, less applicable Tax withholdings, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess of the Per Share Price over the per share exercise price of such Company Option, by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 2.8(a) (the “Option Consideration”) as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date. Any Company Option that is unvested or has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time. 


(b)    Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Company Performance Stock Unit Awards. (i)    At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that vests upon the occurrence of the Effective Time by its terms and without any action by the Company shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash, less applicable Tax withholdings, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Price by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts due   19








________________


pursuant to this Section 2.8(b)(i) (the “RSU Consideration”) as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date. (ii)    At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award and each Company Performance Stock Unit Award, in each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that does not vest upon the occurrence of the Effective Time by its terms and without any action by the Company shall, in each case, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and be converted into the contractual right to receive a payment in an amount in cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Price by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award or Company Performance Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (in the case of any Company Performance Stock Unit Award, based on 100% of the shares of Company Common Stock underlying such award). Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8(b)(ii), the cash-based award provided for by this Section 2.8(b)(ii) shall be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Unit Award or Company Performance Stock Unit Award (including time-based vesting conditions and any accelerated vesting provisions of any Employee Benefit Plan applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award or Company Performance Stock Unit Award, but, in the case of Company Performance Stock Unit Awards, excluding any performance-based vesting conditions, in accordance with the terms of the Company Performance Stock Unit Awards). 


(c)    Further Actions. The Company (including the Company Board or any committee thereof that governs or administers the outstanding Company Equity Awards and/or the Company Equity Plan) shall, prior to the Effective Time, take or cause to be taken all actions to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.8 and to terminate the Company Equity Plans, effective as of the Effective Time; such that, following the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company Equity Awards (whether vested or unvested). 


2.9    Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Company’s 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board will adopt resolutions and take all other actions as may be required to provide that (i) no new participants will commence participation in the ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no participant will be allowed to increase his or her payroll contribution rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement or make separate non-payroll contributions on or following the date of this Agreement; and (iii) no new Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) or Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) will commence or be extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, after the date of this Agreement. If the Effective Time is expected to occur prior to the end of the current Purchase Period, the Company shall take action to provide for an earlier exercise date (including for purposes of determining the Purchase Price (as defined in the ESPP) for the current Purchase Period (such earlier date, the “Early ESPP Exercise Date”)). The Early ESPP Exercise Date will be as close to the Effective Time as is administratively practicable. The ESPP will terminate, in accordance with its terms, no later than immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger). 


2.10    Exchange of Certificates. 


(a)    Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a transfer agent or such other bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent. 


(b)    Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Dissenting Company Shares) become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 (the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the   20








________________


level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. 


(c)    Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) and (ii) subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.10(c), uncertificated Shares that represented outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Uncertificated Shares”): (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent, subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.10(c)); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.10(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7. 


(d)    DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A) the number of Shares (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date. 


(e)    Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so   21








________________


surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered. 


(f)    No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 


(g)    Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such Shares for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.10 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto. 


2.11    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.10(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 


2.12    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 


2.13    Required Withholding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and their Affiliates will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Shares or Company Equity Awards, or any other applicable Person, such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom   22








________________


pursuant to any Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 


2.14    No Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. 


2.15    Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

3.2    Authority; Approvals and Enforceability. 


(a)    Authority.

(ii)    if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether during the Go-Shop Period or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company   51

Board (or a committee thereof) shall not take any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) or (B) unless: (1)    the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; (2)    the Company Group and its Representatives have complied in all material respects with their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; (3)    (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the “Proposal Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.3(e)(ii) absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Proposal Notice Period, must have (1) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (2) taken into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties proposed by Parent and other information provided by Parent during the Proposal Notice Period, in each case, that are offered in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the last day of the Proposal Notice Period, in a manner that would constitute a binding agreement between the parties if accepted by the Company; provided, however, that in the event of any material modifications to such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that any change to the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification), the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (it being understood that the “Proposal Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be three (3) Business Days); (4)    following such Proposal Notice Period, including any subsequent Proposal Notice Period as provided in the final proviso of the foregoing Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3), the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranties and any other information provided by Parent) shall have determined that the failure of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; and (5)    in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), including paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b)(iii). 


(f)    Notice. (i)    From the Agreement Date until the first to occur of the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, the Cut-Off Time) and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to   52

Article VIII, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal, including a summary of the material terms and conditions thereof and whether the person making such Acquisition Proposal is a strategic acquirer or a financial sponsor and thereafter the Company must inform Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any material modifications to the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include (among other things) any changes to the form or amount of consideration; provided, however that the Company shall not be required to disclose the specific identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal prior to the Cut-Off Time. Immediately after the Cut-Off Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice setting forth (A) the identity of each Excluded Party and (B) the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal made by such Excluded Party (including copies of any materials and documents related thereto). The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or other agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from complying with this Section 5.3(f). (ii)    From the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent if any Inquiries, offers or proposals or requests for non-public information or discussions that constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any material revisions to the terms and conditions of any pending Acquisition Proposals disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(f)(i), are received by the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Third Person making such Inquiries, offers or proposals, (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Inquiries, offers or proposals to the extent such material terms and conditions are not included in the written materials provided in the following clause (iii); and (iii) copies of any written materials and documents relating thereto provided to the Company or its Representatives. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status (and supplementally provide the material terms) of any such Inquiries, offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto and any new, amended or revised written materials relating thereto provided to the Company or its Representatives) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. 


(g)    Certain Disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3; or (iv) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders as required by applicable Law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement, it being understood that (1) any such statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) pursuant to this Section 5.3(g) must be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.3, and (2) nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 5.3(e). 


(h)    Breach by Representatives. The Company agrees that any breach of this Section 5.3 by any of its Representatives (acting as such), including any failure of such Representatives to comply with the terms of Section 5.3(b), shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.   53

Each Party may also, as it deems advisable or necessary, reasonably designate material provided to the other Party as “Outside Counsel Only Material.” Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing an appropriate response to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority including informing the other Party as soon as practicable of any such investigation or inquiry, and consulting in advance, to the extent practicable, before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority.

6.3    Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings. 


(a)    Proxy Statement. Promptly (but in no event later than the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, if applicable, the Cut-Off Time)) following the date hereof, the Company will prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting (as amended or supplemented, the “Proxy Statement”). Subject to Section 5.3, the Company must include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. 


(b)    Other Required Company Filing. If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an “Other Required Company Filing”), then the Company will promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the NYSE. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel.

Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any written amendment, modification, supplement, consent or waiver to or under any Financing Letter promptly upon execution thereof. 


(c)    Parent shall, upon Company’s reasonable request, keep the Company informed on a reasonably prompt basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and, upon Company’s reasonable request, provide to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of the material definitive documents for the Debt Financing.

Additionally, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, subject to applicable legal privilege or confidentiality obligations. 


(d)    Without limiting Parent or Merger Sub’s obligations hereunder, if all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any applicable market “flex” provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and such portion is necessary to fund the Required Amount, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable prior to the termination date, alternative debt financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient, together with the remaining available Financing, to fund the Required Amount and with terms and conditions (including market “flex” provisions) not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (“Alternative Debt Financing”). Parent shall deliver to the Company forthwith if it obtains the same true and complete executed copies of any commitment letters (including related fee letters) with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing (which fee letters may be redacted in a fashion consistent with the Redacted Fee Letter).   59

(f)    For the avoidance of doubt, compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 6.5 shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all obligations of Parent relating to its efforts to obtain the Financing shall be governed exclusively by this Section 6.5.

Any Covered Person wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any claim, action or proceeding in respect of which such indemnification will be sought, shall notify Parent thereof in writing; provided, that the failure to so notify the Surviving Corporation shall not affect the indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent under this Section 6.10(a), except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation or Parent.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any D&O Claim (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.10(b) shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such D&O Claim. Following the Effective Time, the indemnification Contracts, if any, in existence on the Agreement Date with any of the Covered Persons shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 


(c)    At the Company’s option and expense (after prior consultation with Parent), or if Parent requests, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Merger) of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered individuals as the Company Group’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time for D&O Claims arising from facts, acts, events or omissions that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; provided that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company Group for such insurance (such amount being the “Maximum Premium”). If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may obtain such a tail policy; provided, however, that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium; provided, further, that if such tail policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company shall only be required to obtain as much   64

coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any such policy (whether obtained by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation) to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all its obligations thereunder. 


(d)    In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) sells all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. 


(e)    The obligations under this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated or modified in any manner that is adverse to any Covered Persons (and their respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that each Covered Person (including their respective successors and assigns) shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.10(e). In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this Section 6.10(e), the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.10(e) as such fees are incurred, upon the written request of such Covered Person. 


6.11    Employee Matters. 


(a)    From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, honor all Employee Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if sooner, on the date of termination of employment of the relevant Continuing Employee), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee, (i) base salary and base wages, short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities, commission opportunities, severance payments and severance benefits, each on a basis no less favorable than that in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, equity or equity-based, long-term incentives, defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation and retiree or post-termination welfare benefits or compensation, the “Excluded Benefits”) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding the Excluded Benefits) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Employee Benefit Plans. 


(b)    Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation’s health and welfare benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to participate under the analogous health and welfare benefits plans of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time); provided, however, that (i) nothing in this Section 6.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent, its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate, in accordance with its terms, any benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, agreement, Contract or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, then the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporation’s (or a Subsidiary’s) health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage under such plans is replacing analogous coverage under an Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant under any benefit plan of Parent or Subsidiary of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation (excluding any plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement that provides any Excluded Benefit), then Parent shall ensure that such benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, credit Continuing Employees for their years of service recognized by the Company Group prior to the Effective Time with the Company Group or their respective predecessors; provided that, no credit for any service will be required that would result in duplication of benefits and such credit shall only be given to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding   65

benefit plan of a Company Group Member. Nothing in this Section 6.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Person to employment, engagement or service or any right to continued employment, engagement or service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be “at will” employment. 


(c)    With respect to any group medical plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees participate following the Effective Time and in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any of its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements under any such group health plans to the same extent waived or satisfied under any corresponding Employee Benefit Plan of a Company Group Member in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations under such group health plans in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, to amounts paid by such Continuing Employees during the portion of the year prior to the Effective Time under the Employee Benefit Plans maintained by a Company Group Member. 


(d)    The provisions of this Section 6.11 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no provision of this Section 6.11 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any other Person (other than the Parties) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. 


(e)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms and conditions of employment for any employees covered by a Labor Agreement shall be governed by the applicable Labor Agreement until the expiration, modification or termination of such Labor Agreement in accordance with its terms or applicable Law. 


6.12    Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 


6.13    Public Statements and Disclosure. The initial press release concerning this Agreement and the Merger of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. At all times during the Interim Period, the Company (other than with respect to the portion of any communication relating to a Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to become public, in any such case to the extent relating to the Merger or the Transactions, except that (x) Parent and the Company will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that are (i) required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement; (ii) principally directed to employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications are consistent with the previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually if approved by the other Party); or (iii) solely to the extent related to a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change and (y) Parent will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that are disclosures or communications by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates to existing or prospective general or limited partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of such Person or any Affiliates of such Person, in each case who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions.   66

6.14    Transaction Litigation. At all times during the Interim Period, the Company will provide Parent with prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company will (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parent’s expense) in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). For purposes of this Section 6.14, “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney- client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above. For the avoidance of doubt, any Legal Proceeding related to Dissenting Company Shares will be governed by Section  2.7(c). 


6.15    Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. At all times during the Interim Period, the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to applicable Law and the rules and regulations of the NYSE to cause (a) the delisting of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time; and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. 


6.16    Additional Agreements. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors of each Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action. 


6.17    Parent Vote. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent approving the Merger in accordance with the DGCL. 


6.18    No Control of the Other Party’s Business. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise, consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their own business and operations. 


6.19    No Employment Discussions. Except as approved by the Company Board, at all times after the date of this Agreement until the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will not permit any of their Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates to authorize, make or enter into, or commit or agree to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements, agreements or other understandings with any executive officer of the Company (i) regarding any continuing employment or consulting relationship with the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time; or (ii) pursuant to which any such individual would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share Price in respect of such holder’s shares of Company Common Stock; or (iii) pursuant to which such individual would agree to provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) in no event shall this Section 6.20 require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cause any Credit Agreement Termination unless the Closing shall have occurred and (y) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, all funds required to effect any Credit Agreement Termination. 


6.21    Cash and Marketable Securities. At the reasonable request of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the securities set forth on Section 6.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter and any similar securities then owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably proximate to the Closing Date so as to permit the net proceeds of such sale to be used by or at the direction of the Parent as a potential partial source for the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or payments in respect of Company Equity Awards under Article II; provided, that Parent shall, or shall cause the Guarantors to, in the event the Closing shall not occur, promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the sales contemplated by this Section 6.21 (the “Sale Reimbursement Obligations”, together with the Reimbursement Obligations, the “Parent Reimbursement Obligations”). 


6.22    Tender Offer. At any time after the later of the No-Shop Period Start Date and the Cut-Off Time (if applicable), upon written request by Parent and subject to the consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Parties agree to cooperate and work in good faith to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by means of a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Per Share Price (including effecting the Merger pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL) and to make such reasonable and customary amendments to this Agreement as the Parties mutually agree are necessary to reflect such structure; provided that (i) such tender offer structure shall not delay the Closing and (ii) the inability to make or complete such a tender offer shall not relieve the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger as required under this Agreement. 


6.23    Share Repurchase Program. Without limiting or amending Section 5.2(c) in any respect, promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the date hereof, the Company shall suspend any and all share repurchase programs or other programs with respect to the acquisition of the securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries by the Company or its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not engage in any such programs prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII.   68

Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 8.3(f), nothing in this Agreement will relieve the Company from any liability for any intentional fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to its termination.

(e)    Integral; Payments. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.

The Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Reimbursement Obligations and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3(e) will be the only monetary damages the Company and its Affiliates may recover from the Parent Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreements and Section 8.3(e), as applicable).

(ii)    If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee (if payable) and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3(e) will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties for money damages in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any breach, termination or failure.

Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3(e) will be the only monetary damages Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates may recover from Company Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreements and Section 8.3(e), as applicable); and (2) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreements and Section 8.3(e), as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(ii) will not limit the rights of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 9.8(a) or relieve the Company Group from liability (1) for any intentional fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement or (2) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreements. (iii)    Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, do not constitute a penalty, but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under this Agreement in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.   75

Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party.

9.8    Remedies. 


(a)    Remedies Cumulative.

(b)    Specific Performance. 


(i)    The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not timely perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to the last two (2) sentences of this Section 9.8(b)(i), (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund a portion of the Required Amounts (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions) and the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.3, (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof or will be funded in full at the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter if the Equity Financing is funded and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Company shall take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to consummate the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. (ii)    Subject to Section 9.8(b)(i), the Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent   79

breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. 


9.9    Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. 


9.10    Consent to Jurisdiction. 


(a)    General Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions and the Guaranties, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Guaranties or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranties or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guaranties or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts.

9.12    Company Disclosure Letter References. The Parties agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. 


9.13    Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity. 


9.14    No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

9.16    Disclaimer. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the sole contractual benefit of such parties. Such representations and warranties may be made as of specific dates, only for purposes of the Agreement and for the benefit of the Parties. Such representations and warranties are subject to important exceptions and limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures, made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties rather than establishing these matters as facts, and were made subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may differ from the standard generally applicable under federal securities laws or under other contracts. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 8.5 without notice or liability to any other Person. Any information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may have changed, and may continue to change, since the Agreement Date, and such subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public reports. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of contractual risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of such parties. Any filing of this Agreement with the SEC or otherwise is only to provide investors with information regarding its terms and conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding the Company or its business. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement or any description thereof as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the Agreement Date or as of any other date. The information in this Agreement should be considered together with the Company’s public reports filed with the SEC. 


9.17    Non-Recourse Parent Parties.

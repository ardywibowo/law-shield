  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 28, 2021 (this “Agreement”), is by and among VENTAS, INC., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), CADENCE MERGER SUB LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and NEW SENIOR INVESTMENT GROUP INC., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties”.   WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a business combination through, at Parent’s option, (a) the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving company of the merger or (b) the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving company of the merger, and in which Merger (as defined below) each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than Excluded Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive 0.1561 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a newly issued share of Parent Common Stock (the “Merger Consideration”), as more fully described in this Agreement and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, each of the respective boards of directors of Parent and the Company and the sole managing member of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement and declared this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including each of the Mergers, to be advisable and in the best interests of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub, respectively, and their respective stockholders or equity holder, as applicable, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a) it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and (b) this Agreement is intended to be and hereby is adopted as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows:   


ARTICLE I MERGER   Section 1.1            Merger.   (a)           Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the “DLLCA”), at the Effective Time either (i) the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Forward Merger”), and as a result of the Forward Merger, the separate existence of the Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving company of the Forward Merger (the “Forward Merger Surviving Company”); or (ii) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the “Reverse Merger”, and the option selected by Parent from among the Forward Merger and the Reverse Merger, the “Merger”), and as a result of the








________________


Reverse Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving company of the Reverse Merger (the “Reverse Merger Surviving Company”), as determined pursuant to this Section 1.1(a). Parent shall elect (x) whether the Merger shall be effected as a Forward Merger or a Reverse Merger and (y) in the event of a Forward Merger, the U.S. federal income tax classification of Merger Sub as a disregarded entity, a QRS or a TRS (the “Structure Election”). Parent shall exercise the Structure Election by delivering written notice (which notice shall include, in the case of a Forward Merger, Parent’s proposed U.S. federal income tax classification of Merger Sub as a disregarded entity, a QRS or a TRS) to the Company as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event by no later than two Business Days prior to Parent’s initial filing of the Form S-4), and shall reasonably consult with the Company regarding Parent’s proposed Structure Election prior to delivering such notice. The Merger will have the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL and the DLLCA.   (b)          Non-Voting, Preferred Issuance by the Surviving Company. In the event Parent selects a Reverse Merger in accordance with Section 1.1(a), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the preparation for an offering, to occur promptly after the Effective Time, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, of shares of non-voting, preferred stock of the Surviving Company (the “Surviving Company Preferred Stock”) to Parent and at least one hundred (100) other Persons pursuant to customary processes and documentation for arrangements of this type in the REIT market; provided that (A) the Company shall be entitled to review and comment on any descriptions of the Company or its business in the offering documents for such offering, (B) the Company’s cooperation shall be subject to the provisions of the last sentence of Section 5.12(a) and Section 5.12(b) and (C) the issuance of the Surviving Company Preferred Stock to Parent will be effectuated by a recapitalization of stock of the Surviving Company and not by a contribution of capital by Parent to the Surviving Company.   (c)           Effective Time. The Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing as soon as practicable on the Closing Date a certificate of merger for the Merger in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Certificate of Merger”), in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the “Effective Time”).   Section 1.2            Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, at 8:00 a.m., New York time, on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of those conditions at the Closing), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties (the date on which the Closing occurs, the “Closing Date”).

Section 1.3            Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company. At the Effective Time, (a) in the event of a Forward Merger, the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law; or (b) in the event of a Reverse Merger, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   Section 1.4            Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company. In the event of a Reverse Merger, from and after the Effective Time, each officer of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be a director and an officer of the Surviving Company. In the event of a Forward Merger, from and after the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company.   Section 1.5            Tax Consequences. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code.   ARTICLE II TREATMENT OF SECURITIES   Section 2.1            Treatment of Securities.   (a)           Treatment of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company, each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares of Company Common Stock owned directly by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (such excluded shares, the “Excluded Shares” and all shares of Company Common Stock other than Excluded Shares, the “Eligible Shares”), shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  (b)           Conversion of Company Common Stock. As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company, as of the Effective Time, all of the Eligible Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each evidence of shares in book-entry form previously evidencing any of the Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate previously representing any Eligible Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company Certificates”) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(e) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which such Eligible Shares have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

(c)           Cancellation of Excluded Shares. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company, each Excluded Share issued immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.   (d)           Merger Sub Equity. At the Effective Time, (i) in the event of a Forward Merger, each membership interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a membership interest of the Surviving Company and shall not be affected by the Merger; or (ii) in the event of a Reverse Merger, each membership interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and shall represent one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time.

At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with a nationally recognized financial institution or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to serve as the exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of record of Eligible Shares, (i) an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in uncertificated or book-entry form comprising the number of shares of Parent Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and (ii) an aggregate amount of cash comprising at least the amount required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(e). In addition, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions, if any, to which the holders of record of Eligible Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) with both a record and payment date after the Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such Eligible Shares. Such shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of any dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the “Exchange Fund.” The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose provided for in this Agreement.

(b)           Exchange Procedures.   (i)               Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including (A) appropriate transmittal materials in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares shall pass only upon delivery of the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificates, as provided in Section 2.6) or transfer of the Company Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an “agent’s message” with respect to Company Book-Entry Shares) (such transmittal materials, collectively, the “Letter of Transmittal”), and (B) instructions for surrendering the Company Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Company Certificates, as provided in Section 2.6) or transferring the Company Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. With respect to holders of record of Company Book-Entry Shares, the Parties shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent to allow the Exchange Agent to promptly transmit, following the Effective Time, to such holders or their nominees, upon surrender of Eligible Shares (if applicable under such procedures), the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.   (ii)              Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Shares that are Company Certificates, by physical surrender of such Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Certificate, as provided in Section 2.6) or that are Company Book-Entry Shares, by book- receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent in connection with the transfer of Company Book-Entry Shares or as otherwise provided in the applicable procedures agreed pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(i), in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with respect to Company Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with such procedures, the holder of record of such Company Certificate or Company Book- Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and (B) an amount (if any) in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check) of (1) any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) plus (2) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(h)).   (iii)             No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Company Certificate or ledger entry relating to Company Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock that have been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

(iv)             In the event of a transfer of ownership of Eligible Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with an amount (if any) in immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are provided, a check) of cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or distributions in respect thereof, and in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(h)), may be issued or paid to such a transferee if (A) in the case of certificated shares, the Company Certificate formerly representing such Eligible Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent and (B) in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, written instructions authorizing the transfer of the Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, and in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), such information is accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and Parent. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Company Certificate and Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time at or after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II, including any amount payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e), and any dividends or other distributions on Parent Common Stock in accordance with to Section 2.2(c), in each case without interest.   (c)           Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement as Merger Consideration. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible Share until the Company Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Company Certificate as provided in Section 2.6) or Company Book- Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with this Article II, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.   (d)           Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of record of Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of








________________


Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.   


-6-   


(e)           No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Any holder of record of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 2.2(e) shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of the applicable Eligible Shares, a cash payment calculated by the Exchange Agent, without interest, in lieu of any fractional share, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), as reported on the consolidated tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading, for a share of Parent Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (appropriately adjusted as contemplated by Section 2.5, if applicable) (the “Parent Closing Price”). No holder of record of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock described in this Section 2.2(e) to any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.   (f)           Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Eligible Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any shares of Parent Common Stock and any payment of cash and any dividends and other distributions in respect thereof or in respect of Company Common Stock payable or issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e), in each case, without any interest thereon.   (g)           No Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (h)           Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Company and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with the applicable Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.3            Further Assurances. If at any time following the Effective Time the Surviving Company shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Company its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Company and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of any such Person, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of any such Person, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Company’s right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such Party and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.   Section 2.4            Treatment of Company Equity Awards.   (a)           Company Options. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a “Company Option”), whether vested or unvested, shall automatically become fully vested and shall without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value over the per share exercise price of such Company Option by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable Tax withholdings. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option with respect to which the per share exercise price equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration Value as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration.   (b)           Company Restricted Stock Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding award of restricted shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a “Company Restricted Stock Award”), whether vested or unvested, shall automatically become fully vested and shall without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be canceled and retired, shall cease to exist and be converted into and shall become a right to receive (i) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) to the extent unpaid as of the Effective Time, any accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award, less applicable Tax withholdings.   (c)           Company RSU Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding award of restricted stock units corresponding to shares of Company Common Stock and granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a “Company RSU Award”), whether vested or unvested, shall automatically become fully vested and shall without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive (i) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) to the extent unpaid as of the Effective Time, any accrued and unpaid dividend equivalent rights with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award, less applicable Tax withholdings. For purposes of clause (i)(A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to a Company RSU Award that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions shall be based on the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award.

(d)           Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make any amendments to the Company Equity Plans or the Company Options, the Company Restricted Stock Awards or the Company RSU Awards, and take such other actions as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the Company Equity Awards as contemplated by this Section 2.4.   Section 2.5            Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. If, at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a change in the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case, as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including reverse stock split) or stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, subdivision or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Eligible Shares and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.5 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited or restricted by Section 4.1 or the other terms of this Agreement or permit Parent to take any action that is prohibited or restricted by Section 4.2 or the other terms of this Agreement.   Section 2.6            Lost Certificates. If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 2.2(f), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Other than with respect to any document or response specifically and primarily relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (or any portion of any other document or response that relates to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) made in accordance with Section 5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e), prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or filing or mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version of such document or responses), and Parent and the Company will provide the other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of any written comments and advise the other of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) received from the SEC other than to the extent such comments are made with respect to a document specifically and primarily relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (or any portion of any other document that relates to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) made in accordance with Section 5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e). Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger, and each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information concerning it, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Parent and the Company will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either Parent or the Company, and such information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  (b)        The Company shall duly take all lawful action to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date on which the Form S-4 is declared effective (the “Company Stockholders Meeting”) for the purpose of obtaining the Company Required Vote (with the date initially set for the Company Stockholders Meeting being no more than 45 days following such effective date). The Company and the Company Board shall not propose any matters to be voted on at the Company Stockholders Meeting other than the matters contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Company Required Vote (and matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the stockholders of the Company in connection therewith). Unless the Company Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e), the Company and the Company Board shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of the Company the Company Required Vote and conduct any proxy solicitation exercise and undertake any other steps as may reasonably be requested by Parent to assist in obtaining the Company Required Vote. Unless the Company Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e)), the Company Board will recommend to the Company’s stockholders the adoption of this Agreement (the “Company Board Recommendation”). The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent; provided, however, that if, on or prior to the date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (as it may be postponed or adjourned in accordance with this Section 5.1(b)), (i) the Company has not received and reasonably does not expect that it will receive proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting; provided that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is (x) more than 10 Business Days after it is then scheduled, (y) more than 60 days after the date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled or (z) less than 10 Business Days prior to the Outside Date (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law) or (ii) the Company or Parent has determined that it is necessary to pay a REIT Dividend pursuant to Section 5.9 but is unable to notify the other Party thereof on or before the date that is 10 Business Days prior to the then-scheduled Company Stockholders Meeting, then Company shall be permitted to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting until a date that is not later than 10 Business Days after such determination is made in order to enable the Party intending to pay such REIT Dividend to submit such notice to the other Party and publicly announce such determination; provided that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is less than 10 Business Days prior to the Outside Date (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably regular basis upon a request by Parent or its Representatives, during the period between the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, of the number of valid proxy votes received in respect of the matters to be proposed at the Company Stockholders Meeting (with the number of valid proxy votes for and against being separately identified in respect of each such matter). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company shall hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 5.1 and submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the adoption thereof.

(e)        Each of the Company, the Company Board, Parent and the Board of Directors of Parent shall, if any Takeover Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  (b)        The foregoing notwithstanding, if at any time before the time the Company Required Vote is obtained, the Company Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not resulted from a Willful Breach of this Section 5.4, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, subject to compliance with Section 5.4(c), (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that (1) does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.4 and (2) contains provisions that, in each case, are not materially less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that no such confidentiality agreement shall be required to contain any standstill or similar provisions) (such a confidentiality agreement, an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”), a copy of which Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement shall be provided to Parent promptly after its execution; provided, that all such information (to the extent that such information is non-public and has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.   (c)        The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of its or their Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the Person(s) making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal offer or request (and shall include unredacted copies of any written proposals, indications of interest, draft agreements and other written materials relating to the financial terms or other material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives and the Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request or any of its Affiliates or its or their Representatives). The Company shall thereafter (i) keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material developments (including material oral communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal) or changes in the status and details (including any changes to the type and amount of consideration) of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent unredacted copies of any written proposals, indications of interest, draft agreements and other written materials relating to the financial terms or other material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives and the Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request or any of its Affiliates or its or their Representatives.

  (d)        Anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the time the Company Required Vote is obtained, if the Company Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not been withdrawn and that has not resulted from a Willful Breach of this Section 5.4 and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action in response to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may, subject to compliance with this Section 5.4(d), make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, that (A) the Company shall first notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action that the Company intends to take such action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy of such proposal and a copy of any financing commitments (in the form provided to the Company) relating thereto (and, to the extent not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the Person(s) making any such Acquisition Proposal), (B) the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives during such four Business Day notice period, to the extent Parent and Merger Sub wish to negotiate and make themselves reasonably available to negotiate, to enable Parent and Merger Sub to jointly propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in a binding written proposal by Parent and Merger Sub, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions proposed by Parent and Merger Sub were to be given effect and that the failure to take such action in response to such Superior Proposal would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Superior Proposal (including as a result of any proposed amendment to the terms of this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal), the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent and Merger Sub an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence each time, except each such notice period shall be two Business Days (instead of four Business Days), during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.4(d) anew with respect to each such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.

Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change of the type described in clauses (v), (vi) or (viii) (to the extent relating to the foregoing clauses (v) or (vi)) of the definition thereof in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that (i) the Company shall first notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action that the Company intends to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event (including the facts and circumstances providing the basis for the determination by the Company Board to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change), (ii) the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives during such four Business Day period, to the extent Parent and Merger Sub wish to negotiate and make themselves reasonably available to negotiate, to enable Parent and Merger Sub to jointly propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) the Company and its Representatives shall provide to Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives all applicable information with respect to such Intervening Event reasonably requested by Parent and/or Merger Sub to permit it to propose revisions to the terms of the Agreement, and (iv) upon the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any such revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in a binding written proposal by Parent and Merger Sub, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.   (f)         The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, cease immediately any and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to or ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual or potential (including if such discussions or negotiations were for the purpose of soliciting any) Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any indication, proposal, request or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly instruct any such Third Party (and any of its Representatives) in possession of confidential information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with such discussions or negotiations to return or destroy all such information promptly after the date hereof in accordance with the relevant confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Third Party. The Company shall enforce, and not waive, terminate or modify without Parent’s prior written consent, any confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement (other than in the Confidentiality Agreement), unless the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such enforcement or the failure to waive, terminate or modify would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  (g)        Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prevent the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the holders of Company Common Stock a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act, (ii) making any required disclosure to the holders of Company Common Stock if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (iii) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, that in the case of any of (i), (ii) or (iii), any such action or disclosure that would constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in compliance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4.   Section 5.5         NYSE Listing. Parent shall take all necessary action to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance.

(a)        For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the “Continuing Employees”), for so long as such Continuing Employee is employed following the Effective Time, (i) an annual base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable to such Continuing Employee than the annual base salary or wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than is provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, provided that, except as provided in Section 5.6(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, for the 2021 performance year, such Continuing Employee shall receive an annual cash bonus at least equal to the annual cash bonus that was paid to such Continuing Employee by the Company for the 2020 performance year and payable at the earlier of (A) the date of such Continuing Employee’s termination of employment without cause or due to death or disability and (B) March 15, 2022; (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee under the applicable severance benefit practices of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth on Section 5.6(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and (iv) employee benefits (other than annual base salary or wage rate, annual cash bonus opportunities and severance benefits) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, provided that, for purposes of this clause (iv), the employee benefits generally provided to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than annual base salary or wage rate, annual cash bonus opportunities and severance benefits) shall be deemed to be substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than annual base salary or wage rate, annual cash bonus opportunities and severance benefits), it being understood that the Continuing Employees may commence participation in the “employee benefit plans,” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “New Plans”) at such times as are determined by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to employ any Person.

(c)        If requested by Parent not less than 10 Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Company Benefit Plans that are Tax-qualified defined contribution plans (collectively, the “Company Qualified DC Plan”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date but contingent on the occurrence of the Closing. The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 (b)               Any payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds (in U.S. dollars) to an account designated in writing by Parent.   (c)               If Parent decides to apply for a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the receipt of the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance (if any) requested by Parent with respect thereto at Parent’s expense.   (d)               The parties agree and understand that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.3 do not constitute a penalty and that the Company will not be entitled to argue that the Company Termination Fee is unenforceable or should be reduced in any manner. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any Company Termination Fee due pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company shall also pay any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against the Company.

  (e)               The “Company Termination Fee” shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $20,200,000 (the “Company Base Amount”) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the “REIT Requirements”) for such year determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to Parent (taking into account any known or anticipated income of Parent which is not Qualifying Income and any appropriate “cushion” as determined by such accountants). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that Parent’s receipt of the Company Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Company Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Company Base Amount and the Company shall, upon receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Company Base Amount within five Business Days. In the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Company Base Amount due to the above limitations, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within two Business Days of termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives either one or a combination of the following once or more often: (x) a letter from Parent’s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (y) the Tax Guidance providing that Parent’s receipt of the unpaid Company’s Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, in either of which events the Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Company Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in clause (x) above within five Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof. The obligation of the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Company Termination Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee terminates shall be released to the Company. “Qualifying Income” shall mean income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)–(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)–(I) of the Code. “Tax Guidance” shall mean a reasoned opinion from counsel or other tax advisor or a ruling from the IRS   ARTICLE VIII GENERAL PROVISIONS   Section 8.1          Survival. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements, shall survive the Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time.   Section 8.2          Amendment; Waiver. Subject to the provisions of applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived if, and only if, such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment or modification, by the Company and Parent, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. The conditions to each of the respective Parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are for the sole benefit of such Party and may be waived by such Party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

AGREEMENT 


The parties to this Agreement, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I. THE MERGERS Section 1.1 The Mergers; Effect of Mergers. At the First Effective Time, Acquisition Sub I shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the separate existence of Acquisition Sub I shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the “Initial Surviving Corporation”) in the First Merger. At the Second Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Acquisition Sub II in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA, whereupon the separate existence of the Company shall cease, with Acquisition Sub II continuing its existence as the surviving limited liability company (the “Surviving Company”). From and after the Second Effective Time, all the property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of the Company and the Acquisition Subs shall be vested in the Surviving Company and all of the debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company and Acquisition Subs shall become the debts, obligations, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as provided under the DGCL and DLLCA. 


Section 1.2 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Mergers (the “Closing”) shall be held remotely by exchange of documents and signatures (or their electronic counterparts) unless a place for the Closing to be held in person is agreed to in writing by the parties to this Agreement, on a date to be designated jointly by Parent and the Company, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder and by applicable Legal Requirements, waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of all conditions to the parties’ respective obligations to effect the Mergers set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject   2








________________


to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions at the Closing, unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the “Closing Date.” Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the First Merger in the form set forth in Exhibit C hereto (the “First Certificate of Merger”) and immediately thereafter a certificate of merger with respect to the Second Merger in the form set forth in Exhibit D hereto (the “Second Certificate of Merger,” together with the First Certificate of Merger, the “Certificates of Merger”) to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Secretary of State”) and make all other filings or recordings required by the Company, the Acquisition Subs or Parent under the DGCL and DLLCA in connection with effecting the Mergers. The Mergers shall become effective on the date and at such time as the Certificates of Merger are filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as may be mutually agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificates of Merger (the time at which the First Merger becomes effective being referred to in this Agreement as the “First Effective Time” and the time at which the Second Merger becomes effective being referred to in this Agreement as the “Second Effective Time”). 


Section 1.3 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. (a) At the First Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time, shall continue to be the certificate of incorporation of the Initial Surviving Corporation until, subject to the requirements of Section 4.13, thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements. (b) At the First Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall continue to be the bylaws of the Initial Surviving Corporation until, subject to the requirements of Section 4.13, thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements. (c) At the Second Effective Time, the certificate of formation of Acquisition Sub II in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall continue to be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company until, subject to the requirements of Section 4.13, thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements. (d) The limited liability company agreement of Acquisition Sub II in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will continue to be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until, subject to the requirements of Section 4.13, thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements. 


Section 1.4 Directors and Officers. (a) From and after the First Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Acquisition Sub I immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Initial Surviving Corporation until their successor has been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Initial Surviving Corporation.   3








________________


(b) From and after the Second Effective Time, the officers of Acquisition Sub II immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until their respective successors have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company. (c) Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall offer at least two members of the Company Board mutually agreed by Parent and the Company the opportunity to join the Parent Board effective as of the First Effective Time, and shall take all necessary action so that upon the First Effective Time, such offered members of the Company Board shall become members of the Parent Board, each to hold office until the earliest to occur of the appointment or election and qualification of his or her respective successor or his or her death, resignation, disqualification or proper removal as a member of the Parent Board. 


Section 1.5 Treatment of Capital Stock in the Mergers. (a) Treatment of Capital Stock in the First Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the First Effective Time, automatically, by virtue of the First Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub I, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: (i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the Company’s treasury or are held directly by a Company Subsidiary, Parent or Acquisition Sub I immediately prior to the First Effective Time (collectively, with the Dissenting Shares, “Excluded Shares”) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof; (ii) except as provided in Section 1.5(a)(i) and Section 1.6 with respect to Excluded Shares, each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, at the election of the holder thereof in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.12 and Section 1.15 (such consideration, the “Merger Consideration”): (A) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 1.15 (such share of Company Common Stock, together with any share of Company Common Stock for which an election to receive cash is deemed to have been made under clause (C) below, the “Cash Election Shares”) an amount of cash equal to $28.00, without interest (the “Cash Election Consideration”), as the same may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.7(a)(ii) and Section 1.7(b)(ii);   4








________________


(B) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive stock has been made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 1.15 (such share of Company Common Stock, together with any share of Company Common Stock for which an election to receive stock is deemed to have been made under clause (C) below, the “Stock Election Shares”), 1.6839 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (the “Stock Election Consideration”), as the same may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.7(a)(ii); and (C) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which no election to receive cash or stock has been made, the Cash Election Consideration or the Stock Election Consideration, as provided in Section 1.7 (such share of Company Common Stock described in this clause (C), the “No Election Shares”). (iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Acquisition Sub I that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Initial Surviving Corporation. (b) Treatment of Capital Stock in Second Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Second Effective Time, automatically, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Initial Surviving Corporation or Acquisition Sub II, each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Initial Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist. Each limited liability company interest of Acquisition Sub II issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company. 


Section 1.6 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 1.5(a)(ii), shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to, and has properly exercised and perfected his, her or its demand for, appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but each holder of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the First Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the fair market value of such Dissenting shares to the extent afforded by Section 262 of the DGCL); provided, however, that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under Section 262 of the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the First Effective Time), such holder’s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the First Effective Time solely into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as if such shares were No Election Shares, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal of Company Common Stock received by the Company, written withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments, notices or demands served on the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal under the DGCL, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.   5

Section 1.7 Proration. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary: (a) If the product of the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares multiplied by the Cash Election Consideration (such product being the “Elected Cash Consideration”) exceeds the Maximum Cash Amount, then: (i) all Stock Election Shares and all No Election Shares will be exchanged for the Stock Election Consideration; and (ii) a portion of the Cash Election Shares of each holder of shares of Company Common Stock will be exchanged for the Cash Election Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of such holder’s Cash Election Shares by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Maximum Cash Amount and the denominator of which will be the Elected Cash Consideration, with the remaining portion of such holder’s Cash Election Shares being deemed to be Stock Election Shares and exchanged for the Stock Election Consideration. (b) If the Elected Cash Consideration is less than the Maximum Cash Amount (such difference being the “Shortfall Amount”), then: (i) all Cash Election Shares will be exchanged for the Cash Election Consideration; and (ii) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares will be treated in the following manner: (A) if the Shortfall Amount is less than or equal to the product of the aggregate number of No Election Shares multiplied by $28.00 (the “No Election Value”), then (1) all Stock Election Shares will be exchanged for the Stock Election Consideration and (2) the No Election Shares of each holder of shares of Common Stock will be exchanged for the Cash Election Consideration in respect of that number of No Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of No Election Shares of such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Amount and the denominator of which is the No Election Value, with the remaining portion of such holder’s No Election Shares (if any) being deemed to be Stock Election Shares and exchanged for the Stock Election Consideration or (B) if the Shortfall Amount exceeds the No Election Value, then (1) all No Election Shares will be exchanged for the Cash Election Consideration and (2) a portion of the Stock Election Shares of each holder of shares of Company Common Stock will be exchanged for the Cash Election Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares of such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Amount exceeds the No Election Value, and the denominator of which is the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares by $28.00, with the remaining portion of such holder’s Stock Election Shares being deemed to be Stock Election Shares and exchanged for the Stock Election Consideration.   6








________________


(c) If the Elected Cash Consideration equals the Maximum Cash Amount, then: (i) all Cash Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration; and (ii) all Stock Election Shares and all No Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration. 


Section 1.8 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the First Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed or converted into a different number or class or series of shares of capital stock by reason of any stock split, division, combination, change, exchange or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to proportionately reflect such change and to otherwise provide the same economic effect to the Company’s stockholders as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. Nothing in this Section 1.8 shall be construed to permit the parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with, or not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement. 


Section 1.9 Treatment of Equity Awards. (a) Effective as of the First Effective Time, each Company Option held by an individual who, as of immediately after the First Effective Time, constitutes an “employee” of Parent within the meaning of Form S-8, that is outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or unvested, immediately prior to the First Effective Time (each, an “Assumed Company Option”) shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically into a Parent Option on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting, exercise and expiration provisions) as applied to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time, except that: (i) the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock subject to each Assumed Company Option shall be determined by multiplying: (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time; by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole share; (ii) the per share exercise price of each Assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing: (A) the per share exercise price of the Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time; by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole cent, and (iii) the Assumed Company Option shall become fully vested immediately upon the First Effective Time.   7








________________


(b) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall take all corporate action necessary to provide that each Company Option and all Company Restricted Stock shall accelerate in full (to the extent not otherwise previously vested in accordance with their terms) as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time. (c) Effective as of the First Effective Time, each Company Option that is not an Assumed Company Option and that is outstanding and unexercised shall be settled in cash immediately prior to the First Effective Time in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option, and (y) the excess, if any, of (i) the Average Company Stock Price, over (ii) the per share exercise price of such Company Option. (d) The Company shall ensure that (a) no new offering periods under the Company ESPP will commence during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, (b) there will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made by the participants under the Company ESPP during the current offering periods, except those made in accordance with payroll deduction elections that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (c) no individuals shall commence participation in the Company ESPP during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date. To the extent applicable, no later than five days prior to the Closing Date, in the case of any outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPP, any then-current offering period under the Company ESPP shall end and each participant’s accumulated payroll deductions shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Shares of Company Common Stock held in participants’ Company ESPP account balances immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be treated the same as all other shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5(a). The Company shall ensure that the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the First Effective Time contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. (e) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock for delivery with respect to all Assumed Company Options. Parent shall file and cause to be effective as of no later than the First Effective Time, a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or other appropriate form under the Securities Act, relating to shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable with respect to all Assumed Company Options, and Parent shall use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain in effect for so long as such Assumed Company Options remain outstanding. 


Section 1.10 No Fractional Shares. (a) No fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the First Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued.   8








________________


(b) Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(ii) (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock otherwise issuable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(ii)) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holder’s certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time (“Company Stock Certificates”) or book-entry positions representing non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time (“Company Book-Entry Shares”) in accordance with Section 1.12, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest and subject to any required Tax withholding, determined by multiplying such fraction by the Average Parent Stock Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Class A Common Stock that would otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this Section 1.10(b) is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

(a) Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall select Parent’s transfer agent or another reputable bank or trust company, in either case, reasonably satisfactory to both Parent and the Company, to act as exchange agent with respect to the Mergers (the “Exchange Agent”). Promptly following the First Effective Time, (but in any event within one Business Day following the Closing Date), Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent: (i) certificates or evidence of book-entry shares representing the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5(a); and (ii) cash   9

(b) With respect to Company Stock Certificates, as promptly as reasonably practicable, after the First Effective Time, and in any event within three Business Days, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of each such Company Stock Certificate (i) a notice advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Mergers, (ii) a letter of transmittal in customary form and reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a Company Stock Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Certificate as provided in Section 1.12(e)) to the Exchange Agent (the “Letter of Transmittal”) and (iii) instructions for surrendering a Company Stock Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Company Stock Certificate as provided in Section 1.12(e)) to the Exchange Agent.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares as of the date that is one year after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand. Any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 1.12 shall thereafter be entitled to look to Parent for, and be entitled to receive from Parent, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.10(b) and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.12(f).

If any Company Stock Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the date on which any portion of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case, that a holder of such Company Stock Certificates or Company Book-Entry Share has the right to receive pursuant to this Section I in respect of such Company Stock Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Company Stock Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. (i) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Exchange Agent may deliver the Merger Consideration (and, to the extent applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.10(b) or any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 1.12(f)) to such transferee if (A) in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, written instructions authorizing the transfer of the Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, (B) in the case of Company Stock Certificates, the Company Stock Certificates formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock are surrendered to the Exchange Agent, and (C) the written instructions, in the case   12

of clause (A), and Company Stock Certificates, in the case of clause (B), are accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent. If any Merger Consideration is to be delivered to a Person other than the holder in whose name any shares of Company Common Stock are registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the transfer of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 


Section 1.13 Further Action. If, at any time after the First Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent, the Initial Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company to be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the officers and directors of Parent shall (in the name of Acquisition Subs, in the name of the Company or otherwise) be fully authorized to take such action. 


Section 1.14 Tax Withholding. Each of Parent, the Exchange Agent, Acquisition Sub I, Acquisition Sub II, the Company and the Initial Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment pursuant to the Code or any other applicable Legal Requirement relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and, if required, paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 


Section 1.15 Election Procedures. (a) Not less than 30 days prior to the anticipated First Effective Time (the “Mailing Date”), Parent will cause to be mailed to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) as of five business days prior to the Mailing Date (or another date selected by Parent which is reasonably acceptable to the Company) an election form in a form mutually satisfactory to Parent and the Company (the “Election Form”).

Parent and the Company will publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline. (c) Any election made pursuant to this Section 1.15 will have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent has actually received a properly completed Election Form during the Election Period. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting it, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event an Election Form is revoked during the Election Period, the Shares represented by such Election Form will be deemed to be No Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made during the Election Period. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent will have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters will be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives if: (A) prior to taking any such action, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Company Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal; and (B) prior to providing any information regarding the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to such third party in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such third party (or there is then in effect with such party) an executed confidentiality agreement that contains nondisclosure provisions that are at least as restrictive of such third party as the Non-Disclosure Agreement and that does not prohibit compliance by the Company with this Section 4.2. Prior to or substantially concurrently with providing any non-public information to such third party, the Company shall make such non-public information available to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously made available by the Company to Parent). The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) inform Parent if the Company furnishes non-public information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided for in this Section 4.2(a) and will keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis (and, in any event, within 48 hours), of the status and material terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes to the material terms thereof) and the status of any material discussions and negotiations with respect thereto. (b) If the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal (or notice from any Person that it intends to make a Company Acquisition Proposal) or any inquiry or request for information with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or that is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after its receipt of such Company Acquisition Proposal or request) notify Parent in writing of such Company Acquisition Proposal or request (which notification shall include the identity of the Person making or submitting such request or Company Acquisition Proposal and an unredacted copy of any such written request or proposal (or, if not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof)), together with copies of any proposed transaction agreements, and the Company shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis (and, in any event, within 48 hours), of the status of such Company Acquisition Proposal, including informing Parent of any material change to the terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal, and the status of any negotiations, including any change in its intentions as previously notified. (c) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement (and in any event within 24 hours after the execution and delivery of this Agreement), the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and shall instruct their respective Representatives to, promptly cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations with, any Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date hereof and any access any such Persons may have to any physical or electronic data room relating to any potential Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, or fail to enforce, any standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party, unless the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company’s Board’s fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.   64

Parent shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Parent’s stockholders, and the Company shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of the parties shall promptly furnish the other parties all information concerning such party, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and (to the extent reasonably available to such party) stockholders that may be required by applicable Legal Requirements or reasonably requested by the other party or its Representatives in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 4.4.

Section 4.5 Meeting of the Company’s Stockholders; Company Change in Recommendation. (a) The Company: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements and the Company’s Organizational Documents to, in consultation with Parent and as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective, duly call, give notice of and initially schedule a meeting of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the “Company Stockholder Meeting”), which to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, shall be within 45 days thereafter, which meeting will be held to vote on (A) a proposal to adopt this Agreement; (B) a proposal for a non-binding, advisory vote of the Company’s stockholders to approve certain compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the completion of the Mergers and (C) an adjournment proposal; and (ii) shall submit such proposals to, and, except in the case where the Company Board has made a Company Change in Recommendation, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement from, such holders at the Company Stockholder Meeting, and the Company shall not submit any other proposals to its stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company, in consultation with Parent, shall set a record date for determining the Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, other than: (1) to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is required by applicable Legal Requirements is disclosed to the Company’s stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to the Company’s stockholders within a reasonable amount of time (as determined by the Company Board in good faith after consultation with outside counsel) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting; (2) if required by applicable Legal Requirement or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (3) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (B) the Company may, and if Parent so requests at any time shall, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement if, on the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, there would be insufficient votes to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, in which case, except in the case where the Company Board has made a Company Change in Recommendation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts during any such postponement or adjournment to solicit and obtain such proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable; provided that (x) without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed in the cases of clauses (A)(1) and (A)(2)), no single such adjournment or postponement pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) shall be for more than ten Business Days, except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements or a request from the SEC or its staff, (y) the Company shall not be required to effect, and Parent shall not be required to consent to, any such adjournments or postponements that together cause the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting to be more than 20   69

Business Days after the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled or, in the case of the foregoing clauses (A)(3) and (B), less than five Business Days prior to the End Date and (z) except as required by Legal Requirements in connection with adjournments or postponements of the Company Stockholder Meeting effected in accordance with the foregoing, in no event shall the Company change the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting without Parent’s consent. Subject to the foregoing and applicable Legal Requirements, (I) the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Stockholder Meeting to initially be called for the same date as the Parent Stockholder Meeting; and (II) if, notwithstanding such efforts, the Parent Stockholder Meeting is initially called for a date prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to call its meeting on a date that is as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Upon written request by Parent (which shall not exceed one request per day), the Company shall, during the ten Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, advise Parent as to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting for which proxies have been received by the Company with respect to the Required Company Stockholder Vote and the number of such proxies authorizing the holder thereof to vote in favor of the Required Company Stockholder Vote. (b) Subject to Section 4.5(c), the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement: (i) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Subs, the Company Board Recommendation, or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable (or publicly propose to do so) any Company Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail to publicly announce, within ten Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the equity securities of the Company shall have been commenced by any third party other than Parent and its Affiliates (and in no event later than one Business Day prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to Section 4.5(a)), a statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the Company Board in respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to publicly announce that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer); or (iv) if requested by Parent, fail to issue, within ten Business Days after a Company Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced (and in no event later than one Business Day prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to Section 4.5(a)), a press release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation, provided, however, that the Company must receive the   70

request from Parent at least 48 hours prior to such reaffirmation being required; provided, further, that in no event shall the Company or the Company Board be obligated to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation on more than one occasion with respect to each such publicly announced Company Acquisition Proposal or on more than one occasion with respect to each publicly announced material modification thereof (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a “Company Change in Recommendation”); (v) cause or permit the Company to enter into any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or other arrangement or understanding (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with Section 4.2(a)) contemplating or relating to a Company Acquisition Transaction; (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation inapplicable to any Company Acquisition Proposal or counterparty thereto; or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may make a Company Change in Recommendation related to a Company Acquisition Proposal and/or terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1(f) if (x) the Company receives from a third party a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of Section 4.2, and has not been withdrawn, and (z) prior to making such Company Change in Recommendation or terminating this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1(f): (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (ii) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (the “Company Superior Proposal Notice”) no less than four Business Days in advance stating that the Company Board intends to make a Company Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, which such Company Superior Proposal Notice shall include the identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and a copy of such proposal and a draft of the definitive agreement to be entered into in connection therewith (or, if not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof); and (iii) (A) during the four Business Day period commencing on the date of Parent’s receipt of such Company Superior Proposal Notice, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement so that the Company Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Company Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Company Superior Proposal; and (B) after the expiration of the negotiation period described in clause (A) above, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that Parent and each Acquisition Sub have committed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (A) above and in a manner that would be binding upon   71

Parent and each Acquisition Sub if accepted by the Company, that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal; provided, that if there is any change to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (ii) above and a new negotiation period under clause “(A)” above shall commence (except that the original four Business Day notice period referred to in clause (A) above shall instead be equal to the longer of (1) 11:59 p.m. New York Time on the second Business Day immediately following Parent’s receipt of such notice, and (2) the period remaining under the original four Business Day notice period of clause (A) above), during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of Section 4.5(c)(iii) anew with respect to such additional notice (but substituting the time periods therein with the foregoing two Business Day period). The actions of the Company Board making a determination that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and the Company’s authorizing and providing the notices to Parent required by this Section 4.5(c) shall not in and of itself, constitute a Company Change in Recommendation, a violation of this Section 4.5, or a termination of this Agreement. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may make a Company Change in Recommendation that is not related to a Company Acquisition Proposal if any state of fact, event, change, effect, circumstance, occurrence or development, or combination thereof, arises following the date of this Agreement (I) that (x) was neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (or, if known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board, the consequences of which were neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement) and (y) is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (II) that is not related to (A) a Company Acquisition Proposal or a Company Superior Proposal or any inquiry or communications relating thereto, any matter relating thereto or consequences thereof, (B) in each case in and of itself, any changes in the market price or trading volume of Company Common Stock or the fact that the Company meets, fails to meet or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of its revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period (it being understood, however, that any underlying cause of any of the foregoing may be taken into account unless excluded pursuant to clause (A) or (C)), or (C) any event, condition or circumstance related to Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries (any such state of fact, event, change, effect, circumstance, occurrence, development, condition, circumstance, or combination thereof, being referred to as a “Company Intervening Event”); and, prior to making such Company Change in Recommendation, (1) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that, in light of such Company Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Company Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) less than four Business Days prior to the making of such Company Change in Recommendation, Parent receives a written notice from the Company confirming that the Company Board intends to effect such Company Change in Recommendation, specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable   72

detail; (3) during such four Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the Company Board to effect a Company Change in Recommendation; and (4) following the end of such four Business Day period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that Parent and each Acquisition Sub have committed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (3) above and in a manner that would be binding upon Parent and each Acquisition Sub if accepted by the Company, that, in light of such Company Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Company Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, even if such changes committed to in writing were to be given effect. The actions of the Company Board making a determination that a Company Intervening Event has occurred and the Company’s authorizing and providing the notices to Parent required by this Section 4.5(d) shall not in and of itself, constitute a Company Change in Recommendation or a violation of this Section 4.5. (e) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with Section 6.1, this Agreement shall be submitted to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or their Representatives from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) directing any Person (or the Representative of that Person) who makes a Company Acquisition Proposal to the provisions of this Section 4.5; provided, however, that in the case of either clause (i) or clause (ii), no such communication or statement that would constitute a Company Change in Recommendation shall be permitted, made or taken except in accordance with Section 4.5(c) or Section 4.5(d). (g) Any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 4.5 by any of the Company’s Subsidiaries, or any Representatives of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.5 by the Company.   73

(a) Parent: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements and Parent’s Organizational Documents to, in consultation with the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective, duly call, give notice of and initially schedule a meeting of the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock (the “Parent Stockholder Meeting”), which to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, shall be within 45 days thereafter, which meeting will be held to vote on a proposal to approve the Parent Share Issuance; and (ii) shall submit such proposal to, and, except in the case where the Parent Board has made a Parent Change in Recommendation, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such proposal from, such holders at the Parent Stockholder Meeting, and Parent shall not submit any other proposal to its stockholders in connection with the Parent Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent, in consultation with the Company, shall set a record date for determining the Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Parent Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) Parent shall not postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company, other than: (1) to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the Parent Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is required by applicable Legal Requirements is disclosed to Parent’s stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to Parent’s stockholders within a reasonable amount of time (as determined by the Parent Board in good faith after consultation with outside counsel) prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting; (2) if required by applicable Legal Requirement or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (3) if as of the time for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Parent Stockholder Meeting; and (B) Parent may, and if the Company so requests at any time shall, postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the approval of the Parent Share Issuance, if, on the date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, there would be insufficient votes to obtain the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, in which case, except in the case where the Parent Board has made a Parent Change in Recommendation, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts during any such postponement or adjournment to solicit and obtain such proxies in favor of the approval of the Parent Share Issuance as soon as reasonably practicable; provided that (x) without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed in the cases of clauses (A)(1) and (A)(2)), no single such adjournment or postponement pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) shall be for more than ten Business Days, except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements or a request from the SEC or its staff, (y) Parent shall not be required to effect, and the Company shall not be required to consent to, any such adjournments or postponements that together cause the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting to be more than twenty Business Days after the date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled or, in the case of the foregoing clauses (A)(3) and (B), less than four Business Days prior to the End Date and (z) except as required by Legal Requirements in connection with adjournments or postponements of the Parent Stockholder Meeting effected in accordance with the foregoing, in no event shall Parent change the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Parent Stockholder Meeting without the Company’s consent. Subject to the foregoing and applicable Legal   74

Requirements, (I) Parent shall cooperate with the Company and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Stockholder Meeting to initially be called for the same date as the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (II) if, notwithstanding such efforts, the Company Stockholder Meeting is initially called for a date prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to call its meeting on a date that is as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting. Upon request of the Company (which shall not exceed one request per day), Parent shall, during the ten Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, advise the Company as to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote at the Parent Stockholder Meeting for which proxies have been received by Parent with respect to the Required Parent Stockholder Vote and the number of such proxies authorizing the holder thereof to vote in favor of the Required Parent Stockholder Vote. (b) Subject to Section 4.6(c), the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Parent Board Recommendation. Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement: (i) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify), in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation, or fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable (or publicly propose to do so) any Parent Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail to publicly announce, within ten Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the equity securities of Parent shall have been commenced by any third party (and in no event later than one Business Day prior to the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to Section 4.6(a)), a statement disclosing that the Parent Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the Parent Board in respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to publicly announce that the Parent Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer); or (iv) if requested by the Company, fail to issue, within ten Business Days after a Parent Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced (and in no event later than one Business Day prior to the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to Section 4.6(a)), a press release reaffirming the Parent Board Recommendation provided, however, that Parent must receive the request from the Company at least 48 hours prior to such reaffirmation being required; provided, further, that in no event shall Parent or the Parent Board be obligated to publicly reaffirm the Parent Board Recommendation on more than one occasion with respect to each such publicly announced Company Acquisition Proposal or on more than one occasion with respect to each publicly announced material modification thereof (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a “Parent Change in Recommendation”); (v) cause or permit Parent to enter into any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or other arrangement or understanding (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with Section 4.3(a)) contemplating or relating to a Parent Acquisition Transaction; (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation inapplicable to any Parent Acquisition Proposal or counterparty thereto; or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.   75

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, the Parent Board may make a Parent Change in Recommendation related to a Parent Acquisition Proposal if and only if (x) Parent receives from a third party a bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of Section 4.3, and has not been withdrawn, and (z) prior to making such Parent Change in Recommendation: (i) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Parent’s outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Parent Board’s fiduciary duties to Parent and its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (ii) Parent delivers to the Company a written notice (the “Parent Superior Proposal Notice”) no less than four Business Days in advance stating that the Parent Board intends to make a Parent Change in Recommendation, which Parent Superior Proposal Notice shall include the identity of the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and a copy of such proposal and a draft of the definitive agreement to be entered into in connection therewith (or, if not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof); and (iii) (A) during the four Business Day period commencing on the date of the Company’s receipt of such Parent Superior Proposal Notice, if requested by the Company, Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the Company regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement so that the Parent Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Parent Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Parent Superior Proposal; and (B) after the expiration of the negotiation period described in clause (A) above and in a manner that would be binding upon Parent and each Acquisition Sub if accepted by the Company, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that the Company has committed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (A) above, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal provided, that if there is any change to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Parent Acquisition Proposal, Parent shall, in each case, be required to deliver to the Company an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (ii) above and a new negotiation period under clause “(A)” above shall commence (except that the original four Business Day notice period referred to in clause “(A)” above shall instead be equal to the longer of (1) 11:59 p.m. New York Time on the second Business Day immediately following the Company’s receipt of such notice, and (2) the period remaining under the original four Business Day notice period of clause “(A)” above), during which time Parent shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 4.6(c)(iii) anew with respect to such additional notice (but substituting the time periods therein with the foregoing two Business Day period). The actions of the Parent Board making a determination that a Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and Parent’s authorizing and providing the notices to the Company required by this Section 4.6(c) shall not in and of itself, constitute a Parent Change in Recommendation or a violation of this Section 4.6.   76

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, the Parent Board may make a Parent Change in Recommendation that is not related to a Parent Acquisition Proposal if any state of fact, event, change, effect, circumstance, occurrence or development, or combination thereof, arises following the date of this Agreement (I) that (x) was neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Parent Board as of the date of this Agreement (or, if known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Parent Board, the consequences of which were neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Parent Board as of the date of this Agreement) and (y) is material to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (II) that is not related to (A) a Parent Acquisition Proposal or a Parent Superior Proposal or any inquiry or communications relating thereto, any matter relating thereto or consequences thereof, (B) in each case in and of itself, any changes in the market price or trading volume of Parent Class A Common Stock or the fact that Parent meets, fails to meet or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of its revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period (it being understood, however, that any underlying cause of any of the foregoing may be taken into account unless excluded pursuant to clauses (A) or (C)), or (C) any event, condition or circumstance related to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (any such state of fact, event, change, effect, circumstance, occurrence, development, condition, circumstance, or combination thereof, being referred to as a “Parent Intervening Event”); and, prior to making such Parent Change in Recommendation, (1) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that, in light of such Parent Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Parent Board’s fiduciary duties to Parent and its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) less than four Business Days prior to the making of such Parent Change in Recommendation, the Company receives a written notice from Parent confirming that the Parent Board intends to effect such Parent Change in Recommendation, specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail; (3) during such four Business Day period, if requested by the Company, Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the Parent Board to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation; and (4) following the end of such four Business Day period, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that the Company has committed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (3) above and in a manner that would be binding upon the Company if accepted by Parent, that, in light of such Parent Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Parent Board’s fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, even if such changes committed to in writing were to be given effect. The actions of the Parent Board making a determination that a Parent Intervening Event has occurred and Parent’s authorizing and providing the notices to the Company required by this Section 4.6(d) shall not in and of itself constitute a Parent Change in Recommendation or a violation of this Section 4.6.   77

(e) Notwithstanding any Parent Change in Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with Section 6.1, the Parent Share Issuance shall be submitted to the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock at the Parent Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of the approval of the Parent Share Issuance and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Parent of such obligation. (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent, the Parent Board or their Representatives from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Parent a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement to the stockholders of Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) directing any Person (or the Representative of that Person) who makes a Parent Acquisition Proposal to the provisions of this Section 4.6; provided, however, that in the case of either clause (i) or clause (ii), no such communication or statement that would constitute a Parent Change in Recommendation shall be permitted, made or taken except in accordance with Section 4.6(c) or Section 4.6(d). (g) Any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 4.6 by any of Parents’ Subsidiaries, or any Representatives of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.6 by Parent. 


Section 4.7 Filings; Other Action. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date) and to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws) that are or may become necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date) all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Entity or third party that are or may become necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. For purposes of this Agreement, “Antitrust Laws” shall mean the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Legal Requirements issued by a Governmental Entity that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.   78

Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other as “outside counsel only” or with similar restrictions. Each of Parent and the Company may also reasonably redact material as necessary to (i) comply with other contractual arrangements or applicable Legal Requirements or (ii) prevent the loss of protection under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine but shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in a violation of contractual arrangements, or Legal Requirements, or a loss of attorney-client privilege. Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements or any Governmental Entity, and subject to the provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall: (i) consult with the other in good faith prior to taking a position with respect to any filing required or advisable pursuant to Section 4.7(a) and Section 4.7(b); (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, letters, responses to requests, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party in connection with any such filing or any Legal Proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such information; (iv) promptly provide the other party’s counsel with copies of all filings, notices, analyses, presentations, memoranda, letters, responses to requests, briefs, white papers, opinions, proposals and other submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made or submitted by such party with or to any Governmental Entity in connection with any filing required by   79

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.7(a), Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, whether by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, to sell, divest, hold separate, lease, license, transfer, dispose of, commit to behavioral or conduct remedies, or otherwise encumber, limit or impair or take any other action with respect to Parent’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ ability to own or operate any assets, properties, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any assets, properties, businesses or product lines of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (I) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not enter into or make any consents, offers, agreements or commitments with respect to the actions contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) except as and to the extent requested in writing by Parent as to actions that are conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers, (II) no party shall be required pursuant to the foregoing to commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers, and (III) Parent shall not be required to (x) sell, divest, exclusively license, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of, or (y) grant any non-exclusive license, accept any operational restrictions or take or commit to any actions which restrictions or actions would limit Parent’s or any of its Affiliates’ freedom of action with respect to assets, licenses, product lines, operations or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have an (A) Effect that results in a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) Effect that results in a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided that for purposes of determining whether an Effect is or would be materially adverse to the results of operations of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be the same size (in operations and from a financial point of view) as the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries will grant or offer to grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   80

Section 4.11 Employee Matters. (a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of the Parent Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) to provide: (i) each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who continues employment with Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) after the Second Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) with (A) an annual base salary or base wage rate that is, and (B) a target annual cash bonus opportunity that, taken together with the annual base salary or base wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee after the First Effective Time is, in each case, no less favorable than provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company immediately prior to the First Effective Time; and (ii) each Continuing Employee with employee welfare and retirement benefits (excluding any benefits provided under any defined benefit pension plan or post-retirement medical plan) that are substantially comparable or more favorable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the First Effective Time.   83

(b) All service of the Continuing Employees to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors shall be recognized for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual and level of benefits with respect to each Parent Plan in which any Continuing Employee will participate after the Second Effective Time (excluding any defined benefit pension or post-retirement medical plan) to at least the same extent as such similarly situated Parent Employees are entitled to credit for service under such Parent Plans, except to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent or the Subsidiaries of Parent (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries), as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA to: (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements other than preexisting condition limitations, exclusions or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Continuing Employees and that have not been satisfied or waived as of the First Effective Time under the analogous welfare benefit plan maintained for the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the First Effective Time; and (ii) recognize for each Continuing Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Continuing Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents under an analogous Company Plan during the plan year of such plan in which occurs the date on which the Continuing Employee begins participation in such Parent Plan, except to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits.

In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable prior review and comment by Parent) not later than the day preceding the Closing Date and (ii) following the Second Effective Time and as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, to the extent that Parent requests that the Company seek such determination letter, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans) to Parent’s 401(k) Plan, in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account balance (including any promissory notes) distributed to such Continuing Employees from the Company 401(k) Plan.

Section 4.12 Certain Tax Matters. (a) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (i) the parties hereto intend that the Mergers will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the “Intended Tax Treatment”) and (ii) this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a), to which the Parent, each Acquisition Sub and the Company are parties under Section 368(b) of the Code. (b) The parties hereto (i) shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify, and will not take any action or cause any action to be taken which action would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying, for the Intended Tax Treatment and (ii) shall not take any Tax reporting position inconsistent with the treatment of the Mergers as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal, state and other relevant Tax purposes, unless otherwise required pursuant to a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

Each Representation Letter shall be dated on or before the date of such Tax opinion and shall not have been withdrawn or modified in any material respect except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. (d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates to cause any Company Subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes to merge into the Surviving Company, which merger shall be effective after the Second Effective Time and occur, at Parent’s sole discretion, on the Closing Date after the Closing or after the Closing Date, provided that no officer or employee of the Company or Company Subsidiaries shall be obligated to execute documents prior to the Closing for purposes of effecting any such merger and the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to make or have be effective any Tax elections or Tax filings in connection therewith prior to the Closing.   85

Section 4.13 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. (a) For a period of no less than six years after the First Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all current or former directors and officers of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, any Person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the First Effective Time and any current or former director of officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries who is, was or at any time prior to the First Effective Time serves or served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership joint venture, trust, pension plan or employee benefit plan at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (together with their respective heirs and representatives, the “Indemnified Parties”) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, by reason of the fact of such Persons serving as an officer or director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, while a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, was serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership joint venture, trust, pension plan or employee benefit plan, and the Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) also advance expenses to the Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements; provided that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final and nonappealable judicial determination that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 4.13(a) or otherwise. The parties hereto agree that for six years after the First Effective Time all rights to elimination or limitation of liability, indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or in any written agreement between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and such Person shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect. For six years after the First Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in: (i) the Organizational Documents of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries; and (ii) any other agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding exculpation, elimination or limitation of liability, indemnification of officers and directors or other fiduciaries and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time without the consent of such Indemnified Party.   86

(b) For a period of no less than six years following the First Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall cause to be maintained in effect the existing policy of the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (or a comparable replacement policy) (the “D&O Policy”) covering claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and covering each of the Company’s current directors and officers, in any case on terms with respect to coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than those terms in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which annual premium is set forth in Section 4.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”); and provided further, however, that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Annual Premium, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest comparable coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in lieu of Parent’s obligations under the first sentence of this Section 4.13(b), the Company may, or if the Company is unable to, Parent may on its behalf, prior to the First Effective Time, purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on the D&O Policy with an annual cost not in excess of the Maximum Annual Premium, and in the event that Parent or the Company shall purchase such a “tail” policy, Parent and the Surviving Company shall maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other applicable obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under the first sentence of this Section 4.13(b) for so long as such “tail” policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.13 to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the First Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.13, the provisions of this Section 4.13 that require Parent and the Surviving Company to indemnify and advance expenses shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto. (c) The obligations under this Section 4.13 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (or any other Person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Policy or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 4.13(b) and any of such Person’s heirs, executors, beneficiaries or representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other Person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Policy or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 4.13(b) (and, after the death of any of the foregoing Persons, such Person’s heirs, executors, beneficiaries or representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other Persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Policy or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 4.13(b) (and, after the death of any of the foregoing Persons, such Person’s heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 4.13, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other Persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Policy or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 4.13(b) (and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 4.13 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, any   87

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall (i) consolidate or merge with any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) sell or transfer a substantial portion of their respective assets to any other Person, then in each case, to the extent necessary to protect the rights of the Indemnified Parties and other Persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Policy or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 4.13(b) (and their respective heirs and representatives), proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving corporation or entity or the purchaser or transferee entity, as applicable (or its successors or assigns, if applicable) shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 4.13.

Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification, the term “Debt Commitment Letter” shall refer to the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified.

In the event any Substitute Financing is obtained, references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such Substitute Financing, and references in this Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive financing agreements with respect thereto shall also be deemed to refer to the Substitute Financing and the definitive financing agreements with respect thereto, and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 4.14 shall be applicable thereto as to the same extent as Parent’s obligations with respect to the Debt Financing.

(e) Any Termination Fee due and payable by the Company under this Section 6.3 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be payable by the Company only once and not in duplication even though the Termination Fee may be payable by the Company under one or more provisions hereof. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee when due and payable by the Company, then the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to Parent) at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” (as published in The Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such amount was originally required to be paid, and the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken by Parent to collect payment. In any circumstance where performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement would relieve the Company of its obligation to pay to Parent the Termination Fee, Parent and Acquisition Subs may, in their sole discretion (i) seek specific performance pursuant to Section 7.11, (ii) withdraw any claim for specific performance and require the Company to pay the Termination Fee if Parent is entitled to payment of the Termination Fee under this Section 6.3 or (iii) if Parent and Acquisition Subs are unable for any reason to obtain specific performance, require the Company to pay the Termination Fee if Parent is entitled to payment of the Termination Fee under this Section 6.3.    The parties agree that if the Termination Fee becomes payable by, and is paid by, the Company, then such Termination Fee shall be Parent’s sole and exclusive remedy for damages against the Company and its Affiliates and its and their Representatives in connection with this Agreement, and in no event will Parent or any other Person seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity for any reason in connection with this Agreement; provided, that nothing contained herein shall relieve any party from satisfying any claim in law or equity or from any liability, in each case arising from fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement that is material. (f) Any Termination Fee due and payable by Parent under this Section 6.3 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be payable by Parent only once and not in duplication even though a termination fee may be payable by Parent under one or more provisions hereof. If Parent fails to pay the Termination Fee when due and payable by Parent, then Parent shall pay to the Company interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to the Company) at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” (as published   101

in The Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such amount was originally required to be paid, and Parent shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken by the Company to collect payment. In any circumstance where performance by Parent and Acquisition Subs of their respective obligations under this Agreement would relieve Parent of its obligation to pay to the Company the Termination Fee, the Company may, in its sole discretion (i) seek specific performance pursuant to Section 7.11, (ii) withdraw any claim for specific performance and require Parent to pay the Company the Termination Fee if the Company is entitled to payment of the Termination Fee under this Section 6.3 or (iii) if the Company is unable for any reason to obtain specific performance, require Parent to pay the Termination Fee to the Company if the Company is entitled to payment of the Termination Fee under this Section 6.3; provided that, in the event the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(e)(iii) and the Company requires Parent to pay the Termination Fee, receipt of the Termination Fee shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy for damages against Parent, each Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates and its and their Representatives for the matters set forth in Section 6.1(e)(iii). The parties agree that if the Termination Fee becomes payable by, and is paid by, Parent, then such Termination Fee shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy for damages against Parent, each Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates and its and their Representatives in connection with this Agreement, and in no event will the Company or any other Person seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity for any reason in connection with this Agreement; provided, that nothing contained herein (other than as provided herein with respect to the matters set forth in Section 6.1(e)(iii)) shall relieve any party from satisfying any claim in law or equity or from any liability, in each case arising from fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement that is material. (g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the recipient in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement by the other party, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver. Any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. (b) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy.

Section 7.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Shares who has properly exercised appraisal rights will not have any rights of a stockholder of the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Shares, except those provided under Section 262 of the DGCL, and such Shares shall no longer exist. A holder of Dissenting Shares will be entitled only to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder effectively withdraws or loses his, her, or its right to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, in which case such Dissenting Shares will be treated as if such Shares had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon pursuant to Section 3.1.

  (b)            The Company shall provide Parent with prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments received by the Company from holders of Shares relating to rights of appraisal, and Parent will have the opportunity and right to direct the conduct of all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.   Section 3.4.            Surrender of Shares.   (a)            At or immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”) for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than any Shares described in Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price (calculated for the purposes of this Section 3.4(a) assuming that all outstanding Shares are tendered into the Offer), and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to timely make all payments contemplated in Section 3.4(b) and Section 3.4(c). Such cash may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided (i) no such investment will relieve Parent, Purchaser, or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Article III and (ii) no such investment will have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. No loss incurred with respect to such investments will decrease the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that the amount of cash held by the Paying Agent is insufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make all such payment pursuant to Section 3.4(b) and Section 3.4(c). The aggregate Offer Price as so deposited with the Paying Agent will not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 3.4(b) and Section 3.4(c), except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Any portion of the cash made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent, upon demand.   (b)            Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (a “Certificate”), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate to the Paying Agent or effective affidavits in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.4(f) and will have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to the instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to this Article III. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4(b), each Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and will not evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

  (c)            No holder of record of a book-entry share (“Book-Entry Share”), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that were converted pursuant to Section 3.1(a) in the right to receive the Merger Consideration, shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such holder of record shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share, and such Book-Entry Share will be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on cash payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article III. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until such “agent’s message” (or such other evidence) is received, each Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and will not evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation.   (d)            At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time, Parent may require the Paying Agent to deliver to Parent any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that have been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, only as general creditors thereof and without any interest thereon. Subject to Section 3.7, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration, or any cash that was held

by the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.4, that was delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, trust, unincorporated organization, other entity or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) previously entitled thereto.

After the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer will be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article VIII.   (f)            In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder’s delivery of an affidavit of loss to the Paying Agent (and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver as consideration for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, subject to such holder’s compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in Section 3.4(b) (other than the surrender of a Certificate).   Section 3.5.          Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board shall take all necessary and appropriate action to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations thereunder, the disposition by Company directors and officers of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Equity Awards and any other equity securities (including derivative securities) in the Contemplated Transactions.   Section 3.6.          Withholding. The parties hereto and the Paying Agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld therefrom on account of Taxes under U.S. federal, state or local Tax Law or any other applicable Tax Law. Any compensatory amounts payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 3.2, will be remitted to the applicable payor for payment to the applicable Person through regular payroll procedures, as applicable. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. The relevant party or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall promptly remit, or cause to be promptly remitted, any amount so withheld and deducted to the applicable Governmental Body.   Section 3.7.         Transfer Taxes. If any payment pursuant to the Offer or the Merger is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it will be a condition to such payment that (a) such Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered must be properly endorsed or must otherwise be in proper form and (b) the Person presenting such Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent for payment must pay to the Paying Agent any Transfer Taxes or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or must establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not required to be paid. Parent shall timely pay any other Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

There are no proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, overtly threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that seeks to enjoin the Offer, the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions, other than any such proceedings that have not had and would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company in writing specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents will, at the time such documents are filed with the SEC, at the time the Offer Documents are disseminated to the holders of Shares, at the time any amendment or supplement thereto is filed with the SEC, and at the time of consummation of the Offer, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  Section 5.10.          Vote/Approval Required. No vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve the Offer or the Merger. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Purchaser (which will occur promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement) is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Purchaser necessary to approve this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger.   Section 5.11.          Funds.

Immediately after giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions, Parent will be able to pay its debts as they become due and will own property which has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities). Immediately after giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions, Parent will not have unreasonably small capital to carry on its businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent.   Section 5.13.          Investigation by Parent and Purchaser; Disclaimer of Reliance.   (a)            Each of Parent and Purchaser (i) is a sophisticated purchaser and has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and based thereon has formed an independent judgment concerning, the businesses, assets, condition, operations, and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) has been furnished with or given adequate access to such information about the Company and its Subsidiaries as it has requested, and (iii) in determining to proceed with the Contemplated Transactions has not relied on any statements or information other than the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.

Each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, subject to Section 8.5, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries nor any other Person (including any officer, director, member or partner of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates) will have or be subject to any liability to Parent, Purchaser or any other Person, resulting from Parent’s or Purchaser’s use of any information, documents or material made available to Parent, Purchaser or their Representatives in any “data rooms,” management presentations, due diligence or in any other form in expectation of the Contemplated Transactions.

Each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections and other forecasts and plans and accordingly is not relying on them, that each of Parent and Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, that each of Parent and Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, and that each of Parent, Purchaser, and their Representatives will have no claim against any Person with respect thereto, subject to Section 8.5. Accordingly, each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges that, without limiting the generality of this Section 5.13(b), neither the Company nor any Person acting on behalf of the Company has made any representation or warranty with respect to such projections and other forecasts and plans.

(f)             Nothing contained in this Agreement prohibits (i) the Company Board or a committee thereof from (A) taking and disclosing to the holders of Shares a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (B) making any disclosure to the holders of Shares if the Company Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such statement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) the Company or the Company Board from making any disclosure required under the Exchange Act; provided, that, this Section 6.3(f) shall not permit the Company Board to make a Change of Board Recommendation, except to extent permitted by Section 6.3(d) or Section 6.3(e).   (g)            The Company shall inform its Representatives with respect to the Contemplated Transactions of the provisions of this Section 6.3. The Company acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes of determining whether a breach of this Section 6.3 has occurred, the actions of the Company’s Subsidiaries and the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective Representatives acting in their authorized capacities on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be the actions of the Company, and the Company shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 6.3 by its Subsidiaries and the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective Representatives acting in their authorized capacities on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be.   Section 6.4.         Employment and Employee Benefits Matters.   (a)            Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its other Subsidiaries to, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, maintain for each individual employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who continues to be employed by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof (each, a “Current Employee”) (i) each of base compensation and a target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity that are, in each case, at least as favorable as those provided to the Current Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) employee benefits (excluding any equity, equity-based, change in control or severance benefits or any defined benefit retirement benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (in the discretion of Parent) (A) the employee benefits provided to the Current Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (B) the employee benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries and (iii) severance benefits that are at least as favorable as the severance benefits provided by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to the Current Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser acknowledges that the occurrence of the Acceptance Time will constitute a change in control of the Company (or similar term) under the terms of the Company Plans set forth on Section 6.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter that contain provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights upon a change in control or similar transaction. Nothing herein shall prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) from terminating the employment of any Current Employee in compliance with applicable Law.

  (b)            Subject to applicable Laws, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service rendered by Current Employees to the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate in employee benefit plans of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for which a Current Employee is otherwise eligible to participate (but such service credit shall not be provided for purposes of benefit accrual, except for vacation and other paid time-off and severance or similar pay, as applicable), to the same extent as such service was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time for those purposes; provided, that, the foregoing will not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service; provided, further, that, the service of a Current Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to, any retiree medical programs or other retiree welfare benefit programs or any defined benefit plan. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) waive any pre-existing condition limitations under any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for which a Current Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) credit Current Employees under such employee benefit plans for any eligible expenses incurred by such Current Employees and their covered dependents under a Company Plan during the portion of the year prior to the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying all co-payment, co-insurance, deductibles, maximum out-of-pocket requirements, and other out-of-pocket expenses applicable to

such Current Employees and their covered dependents in respect of the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.   (c)            Without limiting the generality of Section 6.4, no provision of this Agreement (i) prohibits Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any individual Company Plan or any other employee benefit plan in accordance with its terms, (ii) requires Parent or the Surviving Corporation to keep any Person employed for any period of time, (iii) constitutes the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or (iv) confers upon any Current Employee or any other Person any third-party beneficiary or similar rights or remedies.   (d)            Unless otherwise requested in writing by Parent, no later than seven (7) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take actions (i) necessary to terminate any Company Plan intended to include a Code section 401(k) arrangement (a “Company 401(k) Plan”), such termination to be effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and (ii) as described in Section 6.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such actions have been taken (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by Parent). Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and consistent with Parent’s administrative practices with respect to similarly-situated employees in similar acquisitions), offer participation in Parent’s tax qualified defined contribution plan (“Parent 401(k) Plan”) to each Current Employee who was an active participant in a Company 401(k) Plan as of the date of its termination and who satisfies the eligibility requirements of the Parent 401(k) Plan as set forth on Section 6.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter. For the period between the Closing Date and date on which Current Employees are offered participation in the Parent 401(k) Plan, Parent shall provide each such Current Employee with a temporary increase in pay equivalent to full matching contribution for which such Current Employee would have been eligible had such Current Employee been an active participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan, subject to any limitations under the Code. If elected by such Current Employee in accordance with applicable Law, Parent shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to, following the Closing Date, accept a “direct rollover” to such Parent 401(k) Plan of the account balances (including any participant loans) of such Current Employee.

The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication covered by this subsection (e), and Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on each such communication (such review and comments not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any group oral presentations with respect to the above shall be materially consistent with such formal written communications.   Section 6.5.          Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.   (a)            Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities of present and former directors and officers of the Company than are currently provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions may not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until six (6) years from the Effective Time, and in the event that any Action is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the disposition of any such Action or claim, unless such amendment, modification, or repeal is required by applicable Law, in which case Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, make such changes to the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws as to have the least adverse effect on the rights of the individuals referenced in this Section 6.5.   (b)            Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any agreement or Company Plan, from and after the Effective Time until six (6) years after the Effective Time (and thereafter for the duration of any matter noticed prior to such times), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) or former director or officer of the Company (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors, administrators, or Affiliates, an “Indemnified Party”), against all obligations to pay a judgment, settlement, or penalty and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or investigative, and whether formal or informal, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission, including any action or omission in connection with the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, Affiliate, fiduciary, or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or of another entity if such service was at the request of the Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such Action, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation shall advance to each Indemnified Party reasonable expenses incurred in the defense of the Action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced shall have provided, to the extent required by the DGCL, an undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

  (c)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may purchase prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company does not purchase prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase at or after the Effective Time, a tail policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time under the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained at such time by the Company, which tail policy (i) will be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time and (ii) will contain coverage that is at least as protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by such existing policies; provided, that, the annual premium for such tail policy may not be in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.   (d)            Without limiting any of the rights or obligations under this Section 6.5, from and after the Effective Time until the date that is six (6) years after the Effective Time (and thereafter for the duration of any matter noticed prior to such times), the Surviving Corporation shall keep in full force and effect, and shall comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement and made available to Purchaser between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of such Indemnified Party and Parent hereby guarantees the obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to such agreements.   (e)            This Section 6.5 will survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit, and is enforceable by, any Person or entity referred to in this Section 6.5. The indemnification and advancement provided for in this Section 6.5 is not exclusive of any other rights to which the

  ARTICLE VIII INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS   Section 1.               Right to Indemnification.   The Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person (an “Indemnitee”) who was or is made, or is threatened to be made, a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or, while a director or an officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, nonprofit entity or other enterprise (including, but not limited to, service with respect to employee benefit plans) (any such entity, an “Other Entity”), against all liability and loss suffered (including, but not limited to, expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnitee only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Indemnitee was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or the Proceeding (or part thereof) relates to the enforcement of the Corporation’s obligations under this Section 1 of ARTICLE VIII.   Section 2.               Right to Advancement of Expenses.   The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay, on an as-incurred basis, all expenses (including, but not limited to attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition. Such advancement shall be unconditional, unsecured and interest free and shall be made without regard to Indemnitee’s ability to repay any expenses advanced; provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an unsecured undertaking by the Indemnitee to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise.   Section 3.               Claims.   If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this ARTICLE VIII is not paid in full within 60 days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnitee has been received by the Corporation, the Indemnitee may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.   Section 4.              Insurance.   The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, trustee, employee, member, trustee or agent of the Corporation, or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of an Other Entity, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,

Section 6.              Amounts Received from an Other Entity.   Subject to Section 7 of ARTICLE VIII, the Corporation’s obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Indemnitee who was or is serving at the Corporation’s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of an Other Entity shall be reduced by any amount such Indemnitee may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such Other Entity.   Section 7                Amendment or Repeal.   Any right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses of any Indemnitee arising hereunder shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to or repeal of this ARTICLE VIII after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit, proceeding or other matter for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought.   Section 8                Other Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.

Section 9                Reliance.   Indemnitees who after the date of the adoption of this ARTICLE VIII become or remain an Indemnitee described in Section 1 of ARTICLE VIII will be conclusively presumed to have relied on the rights to indemnity, advancement of expenses and other rights contained in this ARTICLE VIII in entering into or continuing the service. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this ARTICLE VIII will apply to claims made against any Indemnitee described in Section 1 of Article VIII arising out of acts or omissions that occurred or occur either before or after the adoption of this ARTICLE VIII in respect of service as a director or officer of the corporation or other service described in Section 1 of ARTICLE VIII.   Section 10              Successful Defense.   In the event that any proceeding to which an Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against the Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that the Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such proceeding for purposes of Section 145(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.   ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS   These Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors at any meeting or by the stockholders at any meeting. In the case of any such amendment or repeal of Article VIII or any section thereof, the amendment or repeal shall be subject to Article VIII, Section 7.

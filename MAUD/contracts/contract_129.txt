 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 18, 2021 (this “Agreement”), by and between Sterling Bancorp, a Delaware corporation (“Sterling”), and Webster Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Webster”).   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Webster and Sterling have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which Sterling will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Webster (the “Merger”), so that Webster is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Corporation”) in the Merger;   WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of Sterling and Webster have approved the Merger and this Agreement;   WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and   WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I 


THE MERGER   1.1          The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time, Sterling shall merge with and into Webster. Webster shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sterling shall terminate.   1.2          Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place by electronic exchange of documents at 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on a date which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties (such date on which the Closing actually occurs being hereinafter referred to as the “Closing Date”).  








________________


 1.3          Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Secretary”) on the Closing Date (the “Certificate of Merger”). The term “Effective Time” shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.   1.4          Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.   1.5          Conversion of Sterling Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Webster, Sterling or the holder of any of the following securities:   (a)          Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sterling (the “Sterling Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of Sterling Common Stock owned by Sterling as treasury stock or owned by Sterling or Webster (in each case other than shares of Sterling Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Sterling or Webster in respect of debts previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.4630 of a share (the “Exchange Ratio” and such shares, the “Merger Consideration”) of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Webster (the “Webster Common Stock”); it being understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.7, the Webster Common Stock, including the shares issued to former holders of Sterling Common Stock, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.  (b)          All of the shares of Sterling Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an “Old Certificate,” it being understood that any reference herein to an “Old Certificate” shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Sterling Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of Sterling Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) a New Certificate representing the number of whole shares of Webster Common Stock which such shares of Sterling Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Webster Common Stock or Sterling Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to give Webster and the holders of Sterling Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to permit Sterling or Webster to take any action with respect to its securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(c)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Sterling Common Stock that are owned by Sterling or Webster (in each case other than shares of Sterling Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Sterling or Webster in respect of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Webster Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   1.6          Sterling Series A Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Webster, Sterling or the holder of any of the following securities, each share of 6.50% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share, of Sterling (the “Sterling Series A Preferred Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly created series of preferred stock of Webster having substantially the same terms (and taking into account that Sterling will not be the surviving corporation in the Merger) as the Sterling Series A Preferred Stock (all shares of such newly created series, collectively, the “New Webster Preferred Stock”) and, upon such conversion, the Sterling Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time.   1.7          Webster Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Webster Common Stock and each share of Webster Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock or preferred stock, as applicable, of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.   1.8          Treatment of Sterling Equity Awards.   (a)          At the Effective Time, each option granted by Sterling to purchase shares of Sterling Common Stock under a Sterling Stock Plan (a “Sterling Stock Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed and converted automatically into an option (an “Adjusted Stock Option”) to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Sterling Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms), the number of shares of Webster Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Webster Common Stock) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Sterling Common Stock subject to such Sterling Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per share of Webster Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price per share of Sterling Common Stock subject to such Sterling Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (2) the Exchange Ratio.

(b)          At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Sterling Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Sterling Stock Plan (a “Sterling Restricted Stock Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a Sterling Performance Award shall (i) if granted to a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of Sterling, fully vest and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive (without interest) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Sterling Common Stock subject to such Sterling Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date and in no event later than five (5) business days following the Closing Date (or on such later date if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code) and (ii) if not granted to an individual described in clause (i), be assumed and converted into a restricted stock award in respect of Webster Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Sterling Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms), and relating to the number of shares of Webster Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Sterling Common Stock subject to such Sterling Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share of Webster Common Stock.   (c)          At the Effective Time, each performance share award in respect of shares of Sterling Common Stock granted under a Sterling Stock Plan








________________


that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Sterling Performance Award”) shall be assumed and converted into a restricted stock award in respect of Webster Common Stock (an “Adjusted Performance Award”) relating to the number of shares of Webster Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Sterling Common Stock subject to such Sterling Performance Award immediately prior to the Effective Time that would be earned assuming the achievement of the applicable performance goals as of immediately prior to the Effective Time based on the higher of target performance and actual performance through the latest practicable date prior to the Effective Time as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of Sterling (the “Sterling Compensation Committee”) consistent with past practice in consultation with Webster, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share of Webster Common Stock. Except as specifically provided in this Section 1.8(c), each such Adjusted Performance Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including service-based vesting terms) as applied to the Sterling Performance Award immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that each such Adjusted Performance Award shall be subject to service-based vesting only and shall no longer be subject to any performance conditions.   (d)          At the Effective Time, each hypothetical Sterling Common Stock investment credited under the Sterling Deferred Fee Plan or the Sterling Directors Deferred Fee Plan (a “Sterling Phantom Stock Unit”) that is unsettled immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed and converted into a hypothetical Webster Common Stock investment with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Sterling Phantom Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms) and relating to the number of shares of Webster Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Sterling Common Stock subject to such Sterling Phantom Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share of Webster Common Stock.

(e)          Promptly following the Effective Time, Webster shall file a post-effective amendment to the S-4 or an effective registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the Webster Common Stock subject to the applicable adjusted Sterling Equity Awards, as required.   (f)           At or prior to the Effective Time, Sterling, the Board of Directors of Sterling or the Sterling Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Sterling Equity Awards consistent with the provisions of this Section 1.8.   (g)          For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:   (i)          “Sterling Equity Awards” means the Sterling Stock Options, the Sterling Restricted Stock Awards, the Sterling Performance Awards and the Sterling Phantom Stock Units.   (ii)         “Sterling Stock Plans” means the Provident Bancorp, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, the Provident New York Bancorp 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, the Sterling 2014 Stock Incentive Plan and the Sterling Amended and Restated 2015 Omnibus Equity and Incentive Plan.   1.9          Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Webster (the “Webster Certificate”), as amended as set forth in Exhibit A (such amendment, the “Webster Certificate Amendment”), shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.   1.10        Bylaws of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Webster (the “Webster Bylaws”), as amended as set forth in Exhibit B (such amendment, the “Webster Bylaw Amendment”), shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.   1.11        Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.   1.12        Bank Merger. Following the Merger, Sterling National Bank (“Sterling Bank”), a national banking association and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Sterling, will merge (the “Bank Merger”) with and into Webster Bank, a national banking association and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Webster (“Webster Bank”). Webster Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger (the “Surviving Bank”) and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sterling Bank shall cease. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Webster Bank and Sterling Bank will enter into an agreement and plan of merger in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C (the “Bank Merger Agreement”). Each of Webster and Sterling shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger as the sole stockholder of Webster Bank and Sterling Bank, respectively, and Webster and Sterling shall, and shall cause Webster Bank and Sterling Bank, respectively, to execute certificates or articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (“Bank Merger Certificates”) immediately following the Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall become effective at such time and date as specified in the Bank Merger Agreement in accordance with applicable law, or at such other time as shall be provided by applicable law.

ARTICLE II 


EXCHANGE OF SHARES   2.1          Webster to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, Webster shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent designated by Webster and mutually acceptable to Sterling (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates (which for purposes of this Article II shall be deemed to include certificates or book-entry account statements representing shares of Sterling Series A Preferred Stock), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) certificates or, at Webster’s option, evidence of shares in book-entry form (collectively, referred to herein as “New Certificates”), representing the shares of Webster Common Stock and New Webster Preferred Stock to be issued to holders of Sterling Common Stock and Sterling Series A Preferred Stock, and (b) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and New Certificates for shares of Webster Common Stock and New Webster Preferred Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and Section 1.6 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Sterling Common Stock.   2.2          Exchange of Shares.   (a)          As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, Webster and Sterling shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Sterling Common Stock or Sterling Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or shares of New Webster Preferred Stock, as applicable, pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates representing the number of whole shares of Webster Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional

shares or shares of New Webster Preferred Stock, as applicable, which the shares of Sterling Common Stock or Sterling Series A Preferred Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) (A) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Webster Common Stock to which such holder of Sterling Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (B) a check representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (y) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), or (ii) (A) a New Certificate representing the number of shares of New Webster Preferred Stock to which such holder of Sterling Series A Preferred Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (B) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Webster Common Stock or shares of New Webster Preferred Stock which the shares of Sterling Common Stock or Sterling Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2. 


-6-   


(b)          No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Webster Common Stock or New Webster Preferred Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Webster Common Stock or shares of New Webster Preferred Stock which the shares of Sterling Common Stock or Sterling Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.   (c)          If any New Certificate representing shares of Webster Common Stock or New Webster Preferred Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Webster Common Stock or New Webster Preferred Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d)          After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Sterling of the shares of Sterling Common Stock or Sterling Series A Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates representing shares of Webster Common Stock or New Webster Preferred Stock, as applicable, as provided in this Article II.

(e)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Webster Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Webster Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Webster. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Webster shall pay to each former holder of Sterling Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Webster Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the consecutive period of five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Sterling Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Webster Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.   (f)           Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Sterling Common stock and Sterling Series A Preferred Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of Sterling Common Stock and Sterling Series A Preferred Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of Webster Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares or shares of New Webster Preferred Stock, as applicable, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Webster Common Stock or New Webster Preferred Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Sterling Common Stock or Sterling Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, that such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Webster, Sterling, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Sterling Common Stock or Sterling Series A Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (g)          Webster shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Webster Common Stock, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Sterling Common Stock, Sterling Series A Preferred Stock or Sterling Equity Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Webster or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Sterling Common Stock, Sterling Series A Preferred Stock or Sterling Equity Awards in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Webster or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.   (h)          In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Webster or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Webster or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Webster Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, or the shares of New Webster Preferred Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF STERLING   Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Sterling to Webster concurrently herewith (the “Sterling Disclosure Schedule”); provided, that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Sterling Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Sterling that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Sterling Reports filed by Sterling after January 1, 2020 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading “Risk Factors,” or disclosures of risks set forth in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly nonspecific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Sterling hereby represents and warrants to Webster as follows:   3.1          Corporate Organization.   (a)          Sterling is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). Sterling has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Sterling is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. As used in this Agreement, “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to Webster, Sterling or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations (including the Pandemic Measures) of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries (including any such changes arising out of the Pandemic or any Pandemic Measures), (D) changes, after the date hereof, resulting from hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, floods or other natural disasters or from any outbreak of any disease or other public health event (including the Pandemic), (E) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on a party’s relationships with its customers or employees) (it being understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.3(b), 3.4, 3.11(j), 4.3(b), 4.4 or 4.11(j)) or actions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (F) a decline in the trading price of a party’s common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts (it being understood that the underlying causes of such decline or failure may be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, except to the extent otherwise excepted by this proviso) or (G) the expenses incurred by Sterling or Webster in negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (D) to the extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, “Pandemic” means any outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics relating to SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19, or any variants, evolutions or mutations thereof, or any other viruses (including influenza), and the governmental and other responses thereto; “Pandemic Measures” means any quarantine, “shelter in place,” “stay at home,” workforce reduction, social distancing, shutdown, closure, sequester or other laws, directives, policies, guidelines or recommendations promulgated by any Governmental Entity, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, in each case, in connection with or in response to the Pandemic; “Subsidiary,” when used with respect to any person, means any subsidiary of such person within the meaning ascribed to such term in either Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC or the BHC Act; and “Significant Subsidiaries” shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Exchange Act. True and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Sterling (the “Sterling Certificate”) and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Sterling (the “Sterling Bylaws”), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Sterling to Webster.

There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Sterling to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities.

As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and for changes since April 18, 2021 resulting from the exercise, vesting or settlement of any Sterling Equity Awards described in the immediately preceding sentence, there are no other shares of capital stock or other equity or voting securities of Sterling issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Sterling Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof.

________________


such fees and assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. Subject to Section 9.14, except as set forth on Section 3.5(a) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule and for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of Sterling and its Subsidiaries, (i) no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Sterling, investigation into the business or operations of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2019, (ii) there is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) there has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2019; in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iii), which would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling.

No such Sterling Report, as of the date thereof (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all Sterling Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Sterling has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”).

3.6          Financial Statements.   (a)          The financial statements of Sterling and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the Sterling Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Sterling and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders’ equity and consolidated financial position of Sterling and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Sterling and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Since January 1, 2017, no independent public accounting firm of Sterling has resigned (or informed Sterling that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Sterling as a result of, or in connection with, any disagreements with Sterling on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling, neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Sterling included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2020, or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   (c)          The records, systems, controls, data and information of Sterling and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Sterling or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling. Sterling (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) to ensure that material information relating to Sterling, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Sterling by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Sterling’s outside auditors and the audit committee of Sterling’s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Sterling’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of Sterling, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Sterling’s internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of Sterling, there is no reason to believe that Sterling’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. 


-14-   


(d)          Since January 1, 2019, (i) neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Sterling, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Sterling or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Sterling or any committee thereof or, to the knowledge of Sterling, to any director or officer of Sterling.   3.7          Broker’s Fees. With the exception of the engagement of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citigroup”) and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., a Stifel Company (“KBW”), neither Sterling nor any Sterling Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker’s fees, commissions or finder’s fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sterling has disclosed to Webster as of the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement by Sterling of Citigroup and KBW, related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.   3.8          Absence of Certain Changes or Events.   (a)          Since December 31, 2020, no event or events have occurred that have had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling.

(b)          Except as set forth on Section 3.8(b) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule and in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2020, Sterling and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.   3.9          Legal Proceedings.   (a)          Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sterling, neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to Sterling’s knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)          There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction imposed upon Sterling, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates) that would reasonably be expected to be material to Sterling and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   3.10        Taxes and Tax Returns.   (a)          Each of Sterling and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects. Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material Taxes of Sterling and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Sterling and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, stockholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither Sterling nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF WEBSTER   Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Webster to Sterling concurrently herewith (the “Webster Disclosure Schedule”); provided, that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Webster Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Webster that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article IV specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this Article IV to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Webster Reports filed by Webster after January 1, 2020 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading “Risk Factors,” or disclosures of risks set forth in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly nonspecific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Webster hereby represents and warrants to Sterling as follows:   4.1          Corporate Organization.

Webster is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Webster.

The books and records of Webster and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Since January 1, 2017, no independent public accounting firm of Webster has resigned (or informed Webster that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Webster as a result of, or in connection with, any disagreements with Webster on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.   (b)          Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Webster, neither Webster nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Webster included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2020, or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   (c)          The records, systems, controls, data and information of Webster and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Webster or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Webster. Webster (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Webster, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Webster by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Webster’s outside auditors and the audit committee of Webster’s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Webster’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of Webster, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Webster’s internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of Webster, there is no reason to believe that Webster’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. 


-32-

With the exception of the engagement of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”) and Piper Sandler & Co. (“Piper Sandler”), neither Webster nor any Webster Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any broker’s fees, commissions or finder’s fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Webster has disclosed to Sterling as of the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the engagement by Webster of J.P. Morgan and Piper Sandler related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.   4.8          Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

(b)          Except as set forth on Section 4.8(b) of the Webster Disclosure Schedule and in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2020, Webster and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.   4.9          Legal Proceedings.   (a)          Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Webster, neither Webster nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to Webster’s knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against Webster or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)          There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction imposed upon Webster, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Webster or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates) that would reasonably be expected to be material to Webster and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   4.10        Taxes and Tax Returns. Each of Webster and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects. Neither Webster nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material Taxes of Webster and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been








________________


fully and timely paid. Each of Webster and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, stockholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither Webster nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of Webster and its Subsidiaries for all years to and including 2019 have been examined by the IRS or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired.

The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to make such filings within thirty (30) business days of the date of this Agreement.

Each of Webster and Sterling shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filings, and Webster and Sterling shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective stockholders. Webster shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or “Blue Sky” permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Sterling shall furnish all information concerning Sterling and the holders of Sterling Common Stock and Sterling Series A Preferred Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.   (b)          The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings (and in the case of applications, notices, petitions and filings in respect of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, use their reasonable best efforts to make such filings within thirty (30) business days of the date of this Agreement), to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. Webster and Sterling shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to Sterling or Webster, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences, in each case subject to applicable law. As used in this Agreement, “Requisite Regulatory Approvals” means all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals (and the expiration or termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof) (x) from the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC and (y) set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, or those the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation. 


-49-   


(c)         Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objection that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Webster or Sterling or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and neither Webster nor Sterling nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be permitted (without the written consent of the other party), to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger and the Bank Merger (a “Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition”).   (d)         To the extent permitted by applicable law, Webster and Sterling shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Webster, Sterling or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (e)         To the extent permitted by applicable law, Webster and Sterling shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.   6.2          Access to Information; Confidentiality.   (a)         Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws (including the Pandemic Measures), each of Webster and Sterling, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of Webster and Sterling shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents that Webster or Sterling, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Webster nor Sterling nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Webster’s or Sterling’s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.   (b)        Each of Webster and Sterling shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party’s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated September 13, 2019, as amended by the amendment to confidentiality agreement, dated March 22, 2021, between Webster and Sterling (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).   (c)         No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the








________________


representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

6.3          Stockholder Approvals. Each of Sterling and Webster shall call a meeting of its stockholders (the “Sterling Meeting” and the “Webster Meeting,” respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, for the purpose of obtaining (a) the Requisite Sterling Vote and the Requisite Webster Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and (b) if so desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of stockholders in connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and each of Sterling and Webster shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same date. Each of Webster and Sterling and their respective Boards of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of Webster and Sterling, as applicable, the Requisite Webster Vote and the Requisite Sterling Vote, as applicable, including by communicating to the respective stockholders of Webster and Sterling its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that the stockholders of Webster and Sterling, respectively, adopt this Agreement (the “Webster Board Recommendation” and the “Sterling Board Recommendation,” respectively). Each of Webster and Sterling and their respective Boards of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the other party the Webster Board Recommendation, in the case of Webster, or the Sterling Board Recommendation, in the case of Sterling, (ii) fail to make the Webster Board Recommendation, in the case of Webster, or the Sterling Board Recommendation, in the case of Sterling, in the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly and without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm the Webster Board Recommendation, in the case of Webster, or the Sterling Board Recommendation, in the case of Sterling, in each case within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Webster Meeting or the Sterling Meeting, as applicable) after an Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by the other party to do so, or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing, a “Recommendation Change”). However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Webster or Sterling, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the Webster Board Recommendation or the Sterling Board Recommendation, as applicable, such Board of Directors may, in the case of Webster, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Webster Vote, and in the case of Sterling, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Sterling Vote, submit this Agreement to its stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event such Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided, that such Board of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless it (A) gives the other party at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (B) at the end of such notice period, takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the Webster Board Recommendation or Sterling Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. Webster or Sterling shall adjourn or postpone the Webster Meeting or the Sterling Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Webster Common Stock or Sterling Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Sterling or Webster, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Sterling Vote or the Requisite Webster Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) the Webster Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Webster at the Webster Meeting and (y) the Sterling Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Sterling at the Sterling Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Webster or Sterling of such obligation.

6.4          Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this Agreement, each of Webster and Sterling shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by Sterling or Webster or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   6.5          Stock Exchange Listing. Webster shall cause the shares of Webster Common Stock and New Webster Preferred Stock (or depositary shares in respect thereof) to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.   6.6          Employee Matters.   (a)           Webster, as the Surviving Corporation, shall provide the employees of Sterling and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the “Continuing Employees”), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof (the “Continuation Period”), for so long as they are employed following the Effective Time, with the following: (i) annual base salary or wages, as applicable, that are no less than the annual base salary or wages in effect for each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) target cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Webster and its Subsidiaries; provided, that, if the Effective Time occurs in calendar year 2021, the Continuing Employees’ target cash incentive opportunities for such year shall be no less favorable than those provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) (x) all employee statutory entitlements; and (y) all employee benefits (other than severance which will be provided as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 6.6(a)) and other compensation that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Webster and its Subsidiaries; provided, that, with respect to clause (iii), until such time as Webster fully integrates the Continuing Employees into its plans, participation in the Sterling Benefit Plans (other than severance) shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing standards, it being understood that the Continuing Employees may commence participating in the plans of Webster and its Subsidiaries on different dates following the Effective Time with respect to different plans. During the Continuation Period, each Continuing Employee who is not party to an individual agreement providing for severance or termination benefits and is terminated under severance qualifying circumstances shall be provided severance benefits under the applicable Sterling Benefit Plan set forth in Section 6.6(a) of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, subject to such employee’s execution (and non-revocation) of a release of claims.

(b)          With respect to any employee benefit plans of Webster or its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), Webster, as the Surviving Corporation, and its Subsidiaries shall (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Sterling Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Sterling Benefit Plan that provides health care benefits, to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Sterling Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with Sterling and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Sterling Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan, or (C) for purposes of any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.   (c)           If requested by Webster in writing at least twenty (20) business days prior to the Effective Time, Sterling shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Sterling (each, a “Sterling 401(k) Plan”) to be terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. If Webster requests that any Sterling 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) Sterling shall provide Webster with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by Webster) not later than two (2) business days immediately preceding the Effective Time, and (ii) the Continuing Employees of Sterling shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Webster or one of its Subsidiaries (a “Webster 401(k) Plan”).

(d)          Webster, as the Surviving Corporation, shall assume and honor all Sterling Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms.   (e)           The parties shall perform the actions set forth on Section 6.6(f) of both the Webster Disclosure Schedule and the Sterling Disclosure Schedule.   (f)           Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of Sterling, Webster or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, Sterling, Webster or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Sterling, Webster or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee (including any Continuing Employee), officer, director or consultant of the Surviving Corporation, Sterling, Webster or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Sterling Benefit Plan, Webster Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Sterling Benefit Plan, Webster Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including, without limitation, any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Sterling, Webster or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b)          For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Sterling (provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Sterling or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Sterling for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Sterling, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Webster, may (and at the request of Webster, Sterling shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year “tail” policy under Sterling’s existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

(c)           The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Sterling Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving person of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in each such case the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.   6.8          Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Webster, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Sterling, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger or the Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by

6.13        Acquisition Proposals.   (a)          Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.13) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Sterling Vote, in the case of Sterling, or the Requisite Webster Vote, in the case of Webster, a party receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions with the person making the Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that, prior to furnishing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, such party shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with such party. Each party will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than the other party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each party will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise the other party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will provide the other party with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other materials received from or on behalf of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal in connection with such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the other party apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.

(b)          Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.   6.14        Public Announcements. Sterling and Webster agree that the initial press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a release mutually agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the parties agrees that no public release or announcement or statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental Entity or stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance or (b) for such releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with other such releases, announcement or statements made after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this Section 6.14.   6.15        Change of Method. Sterling and Webster shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the combination of Sterling and Webster (including the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided, that no such change shall (a) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Webster Common Stock received by holders of Sterling Common Stock in exchange for each share of Sterling Common Stock, (b) adversely affect the Tax treatment of holders of Sterling Common Stock or Webster Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, (c) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Sterling or Webster pursuant to this Agreement or (d) materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 9.2.   6.16        Restructuring Efforts. If either Sterling or Webster shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Sterling Vote or the Requisite Webster Vote at the duly convened Sterling Meeting or Webster Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the Exchange Ratio or the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of Sterling as provided for in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its stockholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.16) to its stockholders for adoption or approval.

6.17        Takeover Statutes. None of Sterling, Webster or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of its Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.   6.18        Treatment of Sterling Debt. Upon the Effective Time (or at the effective time of the Bank Merger for any debt of Sterling Bank), Webster, or Webster Bank, as applicable, shall assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants and other obligations to be performed by Sterling or Sterling Bank, as applicable, under the definitive documents governing the indebtedness and other instruments related thereto set forth on Section 6.18 of the Sterling Disclosure Schedule, including the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest thereon, to the extent required and permitted thereby. In connection therewith, (i) Webster shall, and shall cause Webster Bank to, cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any supplemental indentures, if applicable, and (ii) Sterling shall, and shall cause Sterling Bank to, cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver any supplemental indentures, officer’s certificates or other documents and provide any opinions of counsel to the trustee thereof, in each case, required to make such assumption effective as of the Effective Time, or the effective time of the Bank Merger, as applicable.   6.19        Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b). Webster and Sterling agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Sterling Insiders, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Sterling Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Sterling Common Stock, Sterling Series A Preferred Stock and Sterling Equity Awards into Webster Common Stock, New Webster Preferred Stock or Webster Equity Awards, as applicable, in connection with the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.19. Sterling shall deliver to Webster in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding those officers and directors of Sterling subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the “Sterling Insiders”), and the Board of Directors of Webster and of Sterling, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of Sterling) any dispositions of Sterling Common Stock, Sterling Series A Preferred Stock or Sterling Equity Awards by the Sterling Insiders, and (in the case of Webster) any acquisitions of Webster Common Stock, New Webster Preferred Stock, or Webster Equity Awards by any Sterling Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

ARTICLE VIII 


TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT   8.1          Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Requisite Sterling Vote or the Requisite Webster Vote:   (a)          by mutual written consent of Webster and Sterling;   (b)          by either Webster or Sterling if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint or prohibition permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;   (c)          by either Webster or Sterling if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before April 18, 2022 (the “Termination Date”), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;   (d)          by either Webster or Sterling (provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Sterling, in the case of a termination by Webster, or Webster, in the case of a termination by Sterling, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Webster, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by Sterling, and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written notice to Sterling, in the case of a termination by Webster, or Webster, in the case of a termination by Sterling, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);   (e)          by Sterling prior to such time as the Requisite Webster Vote is obtained, if (i) Webster or the Board of Directors of Webster shall have made a Recommendation Change or (ii) Webster or the Board of Directors of Webster shall have breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.13 in any material respect; or   (f)           by Webster prior to such time as the Requisite Sterling Vote is obtained, if (i) Sterling or the Board of Directors of Sterling shall have made a Recommendation Change or (ii) Sterling or the Board of Directors of Sterling shall have breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.13 in any material respect.

(b)             (i)           In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of Sterling or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of Sterling generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the Sterling Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal, in each case with respect to Sterling and (A) (x) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Webster or Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Sterling Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 were satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Webster pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a willful breach by Sterling, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Sterling enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Sterling shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Webster, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $185,000,000 (the “Termination Fee”); provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “25%” shall instead refer to “50%”.   (ii)          In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Webster pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then Sterling shall pay Webster, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of termination.

Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of Webster or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of Webster generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the Webster Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal, in each case with respect to Webster, and (A) (x) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Webster or Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Webster Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 were satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a willful breach by Webster, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Webster enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Webster shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Sterling, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee, provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(c)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “25%” shall instead refer to “50%”.   (ii)          In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Sterling pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then Webster shall pay Sterling, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of termination.   (d)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages to the extent permitted herein, in no event shall either party be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once.   (e)          Each of Webster and Sterling acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Webster or Sterling, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Webster or Sterling, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” published in the Wall Street Journal on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full.

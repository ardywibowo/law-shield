ARTICLE I 


THE MERGERS 


Section 1.1 Closing. The Parties shall consummate the First Merger (the “Closing”) electronically by the exchange of required closing deliverables on the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of all conditions in Article VI (except for any condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of any such condition), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

On the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), at the First Effective Time, Merger Sub I shall be merged with and into the Company (the “First Merger”).

(c) Effects of the First Merger. The First Merger shall have the effects provided herein and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the First Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all of the rights, powers, privileges and franchises, and be subject to all of the Liabilities, of the Company and Merger Sub I.

ARTICLE II 


EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK IN FIRST MERGER 


Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. (a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action by any Party or any other Person (including the Company Stockholders): (i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Parent, either Merger Sub or the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or otherwise) immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; (ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (except for shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled under Section 2.1(a)(i) and Appraisal Shares) (each, a “Converted Share”) shall be (A) automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and (B) converted into the right to receive (1) subject to Section 2.3, 0.44 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (such ratio, as may be adjusted under Section 2.2, the “Exchange Ratio”) and (2) $23.875 in cash, without interest (such amount of cash, as may be adjusted under Section 2.2, the “Per-Share Cash Amount” and, the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), collectively, the “Merger Consideration”); and (iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. (b) As of the First Effective Time, each holder of (i) a certificate that immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented any share of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) or (ii) any share of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (each, a “Book-Entry Share”) shall cease to have any rights related thereto, except (A) for Converted Shares, the right to receive the Merger Consideration (subject to compliance with Section 2.5), any cash in lieu of fractional shares under Section 2.3 and any dividends or other distributions payable under Section 2.5(d) and (B) for Appraisal Shares, as provided in Section 2.4. 


Section 2.2 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, prior to the First Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-   4








________________


up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the Exchange Ratio (and the Per-Share Cash Amount in the case of any such action related to Company Common Stock) and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock (including holders of Company Equity Awards) the same economic effect as contemplated by Section 2.1 and Section 2.7 prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision hereof. 


Section 2.3 Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of any Converted Share into the right to receive the Merger Consideration under Section 2.1(a)(ii), and such fractional shares shall not entitle the holder thereof to (a) any whole or fractional share of Parent Common Stock, (b) vote any whole or fractional share of Parent Common Stock or (c) any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been required to be issued to holders of Converted Shares under Section 2.1(a)(ii), multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Value. As soon as reasonably practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Converted Shares in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without interest, to the holders of Converted Shares entitled to receive such cash. 


Section 2.4 Appraisal Shares. As used herein, “Appraisal Share” means any share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and that is held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such share of Company Common Stock in accordance, and who complies in all respects, with Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”). At the First Effective Time, (a) by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or any other Person (including the Company Stockholders), each Appraisal Share shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and (b) each holder of an Appraisal Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Share under Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 for such Appraisal Share, (i) the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Appraisal Share shall cease, such Appraisal Share shall cease to be an Appraisal Share and shall be referred to herein as a “Subsequently Converted Share” and (ii) such Subsequently Converted Share shall be deemed to be a Converted Share. The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served under Section 262. Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and Actions related to such demands. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment related to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal under the DGCL or agree to do any of the foregoing.   5

Section 2.5 Exchange of Company Common Stock. (a) Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agent agreement with a financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”). (b) (i) At or prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (A) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, subject to Section 2.3, into which Converted Shares are to be converted under Section 2.1(a)(ii)(B)(1), (B) the aggregate amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable under Section 2.3 and (C) an amount of cash equal to the aggregate amount payable in respect of Converted Shares under Section 2.1(a)(ii)(B)(2), and (ii) after the First Effective Time, on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent an amount of cash equal to the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable under Section 2.5(d) on the shares of Parent Common Stock deposited under the foregoing clause (A) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the “Exchange Fund”). If any Appraisal Share becomes a Subsequently Converted Share, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, (1) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, assuming the effect of Section 2.3, into which such Subsequently Converted Shares were converted under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and Section 2.4, (2) the aggregate amount of cash into which such Subsequently Converted Shares were converted under Section 2.1(a)(ii) and Section 2.4, (3) the aggregate amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable with respect to such Subsequently Converted Shares under Section 2.3 and (4) on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, an amount of cash equal to the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable under Section 2.5(d) on the shares of Parent Common Stock deposited under the foregoing clause (1). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to the holders of Converted Shares and Subsequently Converted Shares out of the Exchange Fund under the exchange agent agreement contemplated by Section 2.5(a). Except as provided in Section 2.5(i), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. (c) Exchange Procedures. (i) Certificates. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the First Effective Time, to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration under Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof under Section 2.5(h)) and shall be in customary form, shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof under Section 2.5(h)), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable, (1) cash in an amount equal to the Per-Share Cash Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate, (2) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock   6

(which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate under Section 2.1(a)(ii) (after taking into account all other Certificates surrendered by such holder under this Section 2.5(c)(i)), (3) any dividends or other distributions payable under Section 2.5(d)(i) and (4) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable under Section 2.3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax was paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate hereunder. (ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any holder of a Book-Entry Share that is a Converted Share shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares that are Converted Shares shall automatically upon the First Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the First Effective Time, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Per-Share Cash Amount multiplied by the number of Converted Shares previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive for such Converted Shares under Section 2.1(a)(ii), (C) any dividends or distributions payable under Section 2.5(d)(ii) and (D) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable under Section 2.3. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares. (d) Distributions Related to Unexchanged Shares. (i) No dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder under Section 2.3, until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) under this Article II. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) by the Exchange Agent at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.5(c)(i), the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with a dividend or other distribution with a record date after the First Effective Time theretofore paid by Parent and (B) by Parent at the appropriate payment date, the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with a dividend or other distribution with a record date after the First Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.5(c)(i), and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.5(c)(i).   7








________________


(ii) Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Book-Entry Shares under this Article II, without interest, (A) by the Exchange Agent at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.5(c)(ii), the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with a dividend or other distribution with a record date after the First Effective Time theretofore paid by Parent and (B) by Parent at the appropriate payment date, the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with a dividend or other distribution with a record date after the First Effective Time but prior to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.5(c)(ii), and a payment date subsequent to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.5(c)(ii). (e) After the First Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time. If, after the First Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the First Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.5(d).

In addition, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall approve, adopt or recommend, propose to approve, adopt or recommend (publicly or otherwise) or cause or permit a Company Entity to enter into any acquisition agreement, agreement and plan of merger or similar definitive Contract, or any other Contract (including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or similar document, agreement or understanding), (A) constituting or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement under Section 5.4(b)) (any such Contract, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) or (B) requiring it to abandon or terminate this Agreement or fail to consummate the First Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time before the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Change of Recommendation or authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(d)(i) if: (i) the Company has received a written Alternative Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.4; (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor) that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Acquisition Proposal, and that the failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation or authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(d)(i) in response to such Alternative Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law;   56

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time before the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Change of Recommendation if: (i) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor) that an Intervening Event has occurred and the failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) the Company Board provides to Parent a Company Recommendation Change Notice in response to such Intervening Event, which Company Recommendation Change Notice shall describe such Intervening Event in reasonable detail and the reasons why the Company Board believes that the failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (iii) if requested by Parent, during the five (5) Business Day period after delivery of the Company Recommendation Change Notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives related to revisions to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions hereof so as to obviate the need for a Company Change of Recommendation; and   57

(iv) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period and taking into account any changes to the terms hereof proposed by Parent writing, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor) that the failure to make such a Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. (g) The Company agrees that any breach or failure to perform or comply with, this Section 5.4 by the Company Board, any Company Subsidiary, or any Representative of any Company Entity purporting to act on behalf of any Company Entity, that would be a breach of this Section 5.4 had such breach or failure to perform or comply been by the Company, shall be a breach by the Company of this Section 5.4.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.8 to the contrary, if any Indemnified Person notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.8, the provisions of this Section 5.8 that require Parent, the Surviving Entity and their respective Subsidiaries to indemnify and advance expenses shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

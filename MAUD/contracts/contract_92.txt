(i) Certificates. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, if applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. (ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6 shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares. (iii) Non-Employee Equity Awards. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of record of Non-Employee Company Stock Options, Non-Employee Company RSUs, Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards and Company Warrants a letter of transmittal. Upon the delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of record of such Non-Employee Company Stock Options, Non-Employee Company RSUs, Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards or Company Warrants, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Non-Employee Company Stock Options, Non-Employee Company RSUs, Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards or Company Warrants previously held by such holder. (c) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   20

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration (subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law). (e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting of such Person of a bond in a reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.9(c) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as provided in this Article II. (g) The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment income or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Stock; provided, further, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this Article II. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 




Section 2.10 Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.   21

As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent an option with respect to shares of Common Stock, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to receive a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (after giving effect to the provisions of the Employee Matters Agreement), without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be paid (x) by the Surviving Corporation through the Paying Agent for holders of Non-Employee Company Stock Options (in respect of Non-Employee Company Stock Options) and (y) by the Surviving Corporation to holders of Employee Company Stock Options (in respect of Employee Company Stock Options), net of any applicable withholding Taxes, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll on the next administratively practicable regular payroll date but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment. (b) Company RSUs. As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically become immediately vested, and each Company RSU shall be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent a right with respect to shares of Common Stock and shall be converted, without any action on the part of any holder thereof, into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock then underlying such Company RSUs multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be paid (x) by the Surviving Corporation through the Paying Agent for holders of Non-Employee Company RSUs (in respect of Non-Employee Company RSUs) and (y) through the Surviving Corporation to such holders of Employee Company RSUs (in respect of Employee Company RSUs), net of any applicable withholding Taxes, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll on the next administratively practicable regular payroll date but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time. (c) Company Share-Based Awards. As of the Effective Time, each share of the Company’s restricted stock and each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of Common Stock granted by the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including stock equivalent units, phantom units, deferred stock units, stock equivalents and dividend equivalents), other than Company Stock Options and Company RSUs (each, other than Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, a “Company Share-Based Award”), shall automatically become fully vested, and all vesting restrictions shall lapse, and, in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Share-Based Award, entitle the holder of such Company Share-Based Award to a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock then underlying such Company Share-Based Award multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding (the “Company Share-Based Award Payment”). The Company Share-Based Award Payment shall be made (x) by the Surviving Corporation through the Paying Agent for holders of Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards (in respect of Non-Employee Company Share-Based Awards) and (y) through the Surviving Corporation to such holders of Employee Company Share-Based Awards (in respect of Employee Company Share-Based Awards), net of any applicable withholding Taxes with respect to the full amount of the Company Share- Based Award Payment, through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll on the next administratively practicable regular payroll date (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the Effective Time.   22

(d) Company ESPP. The Company shall take all actions necessary or required under the Company ESPP and subject to applicable Law to (i) cause the Company ESPP not to commence an offering period to purchase Common Stock that would otherwise begin on or after the date of this Agreement or to accept payroll deductions with respect to any such offering period that would otherwise begin on or after the date of this Agreement to be used to purchase Common Stock under the Company ESPP, and (ii) cause the Company ESPP to be transferred to SpinCo in the Separation in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement or terminated effective immediately prior to the Distribution. (e) Certain Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and any Company Share-Based Awards as provided in this Section 2.11. SpinCo, the Company, Parent, and all other Parties will cooperate to effectuate such payment, including by sharing any equity or employee information reasonably requested by another Party. 




Section 2.12 Treatment of Company Warrants. At the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and cease at the Effective Time to represent a warrant with respect to shares of Common Stock, and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Warrant to receive a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Company Warrant, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Any such payment shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time. 




Section 2.13 Withholding. Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (and any agent acting on behalf of any of them, including the Paying Agent), as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable New Benefit Plans, (i) with respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing, each Continuing Employee will be eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee was participating immediately before such commencement of participation and (ii) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, for the applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs, use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and their covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) subject to the terms and conditions of the New Benefit Plans, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account   57

(d) The Parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other in the exchange of information, notification to the Continuing Employees, preparation of any documentation required to be filed with any Governmental Authority or other third party as one of them may reasonably request of the other in order to implement this Section 6.4 and to ensure an orderly transition of employment for the Continuing Employees in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the exchange of data, documentation and any other information Parent requires (as permitted under applicable Law) to transition the Continuing Employees and the Continuing Union Employees to the Parent payroll, benefits and other human resources systems.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 7.1(i), each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, the following actions and do, or cause to be done, all incidental things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement: (i) preparing and filing, in consultation with the other Parties, as promptly as practicable with any Governmental Authority or other Third Party all documentation to effect all necessary, proper or advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining (and cooperating with each other to obtain or maintain) all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or other Third Party, in each case, that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station Divestiture) (whether or not such approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations are conditions to the consummation of the Merger pursuant to Article VIII); provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no party shall be required to pay (and, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall pay or agree to pay) any fee, penalty or other consideration to any other Third Party (other than any filing fees paid or payable to any Governmental Authority) for any approval, consent, registration, permit, authorization or other confirmation required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, further, that the Parties agree and acknowledge that, except as provided in Section 8.1(b) and Section 8.2(d), receipt of any such any approval, consent, registration, permit, authorization or other confirmation is not a condition to Closing. (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall make, as promptly as reasonably practicable (i) appropriate filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the filing by each of Parent and the Company of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Merger shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, unless a later date is agreed to in writing by both Parent and the Company, and (ii) the FCC Applications with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the FCC Applications with respect to the Merger shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, unless a later date is agreed to in writing by both Parent and the Company. Each of the Company and Parent shall respond promptly to all requests for additional information and documentary material by a Governmental Authority, and shall comply promptly with such requests unless the Parent and Company agree with each other to defer compliance, and shall use reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary and appropriate to obtain all necessary approvals and to cause the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods as soon as practicable so as to permit consummation of the contemplated transactions as soon as practicable. (c) The Company and Parent shall each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger and the Station Divestiture, if applicable, under the HSR Act and neither Parent nor the Company shall, without the written consent of the other: (i) pull and refile any notification under the HSR Act, (ii) agree to extend any waiting period, (iii) enter into any timing agreement with any Governmental Authority, or (iv) agree with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any period of time.   59

(d) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Order, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions, (ii) promptly inform the other Party of (and if in writing, supply to the other Party) any substantive or procedural communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the DOJ, the FCC or any other similar Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) consult with each other prior to taking any material position with respect to the filings under the HSR Act, the Communications Act and the FCC Rules in discussions with or filings to be submitted to any Governmental Authority, (iv) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any Governmental Authority with respect to filings under the HSR Act, the Communications Act and the FCC Rules and (v) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such Party with any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act, the Communications Act and the FCC Rules; provided, that documents or information required to be provided pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) (x) may be redacted as necessary (I) to comply with contractual arrangements, (II) to address good faith legal privilege concerns, or (III) to remove references concerning the valuation or alternative bidders, and (y) may be designated as “outside counsel only,” which materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel and previously-agreed consultants of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel or consultants to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. (e) The Company and Parent acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any application for renewal of any FCC License with respect to any Company Station and thereby to facilitate the grant of the FCC Consent with respect to such Company Station, each of the Company, Parent and their applicable Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Company Station in connection with (i) any pending complaints that such Company Station aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against such Company Station with respect to which the FCC may permit the Company or Parent (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to enter into a tolling agreement. For each application for renewal of any Company Station License (a “Renewal Application”) that is pending on the date hereof or that must be filed prior to the grant of the FCC Consent, Parent shall request in the FCC Applications that the FCC apply its policy permitting the processing of transfer of control or assignment of FCC authorizations in transactions involving multiple stations notwithstanding the pendency of one or more Renewal Applications (the “FCC Renewal Policy”). Parent shall make such customary representations and agree to such customary undertakings in the FCC Applications as are reasonably required to invoke the FCC Renewal Policy, including undertakings to assume the position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal Application and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal Application.   60

(f) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of the effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. No extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of the Company and Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof. (g) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive or procedural conversation, telephone call or video conference, with any Governmental Authority in respect of the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in Section 7.1(a))) without the other, (ii) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation and (iii) in the event one such Party is prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental Authority from participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep the non-participating Party reasonably apprised with respect thereto. (h) Subject to Section 7.1(i), each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take actions to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible, including (i) the use of reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or the commencement of any Proceeding in any forum that could result in, any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to use such reasonable best efforts, and promptly to use such reasonable best efforts to undertake the Station Divestiture (as defined in Schedule 7.1(h)) and Approval Actions listed on Schedule 7.1(h), and (ii) the use of reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent or preliminary Order is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station Divestiture) in accordance with its terms unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Station Divestiture), any and all steps (including the appeal thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened Order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall take the actions described in Schedule 7.1(h) in accordance with the terms thereof. (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing set forth in this Section 7.1 or otherwise in this Agreement shall: (i) require, or be construed to require the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any Station Divestiture or Approval Action, unless such Station Divestiture or Approval Action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger; (ii) require, or be construed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to agree or propose to take or consent to the taking of any Station Divestiture, Approval Actions or any other actions contemplated by this Section 7.1, other than (x) the Station Divestiture and Approval Actions listed on Schedule 7.1(h); or   61

(iii) require the Company, SpinCo or its Subsidiaries that are SpinCo Entities (x) to sell, divest, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise limit its freedom of action with respect to any SpinCo Asset (as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement), (y) retain any RemainCo Asset or RemainCo Liability (as such terms are defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement) unless (A) such retention would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the Closing, (B) in the case of a RemainCo Asset, Parent agrees that the Company or SpinCo may retain such RemainCo Asset for no consideration or cost to the Company or SpinCo and (C) in the case of a RemainCo Liability, Parent agrees to fully reimburse and indemnify the Company or SpinCo, as applicable, against such RemainCo Liability, with the form and substance of the agreements by Parent referenced in each of the preceding clauses (B) and (C) to be reasonably satisfactory to the Company in its good faith determination. (j) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents required under any Company Material Contract. Schedule 7.1(j) identifies those consents the receipt of which is a condition precedent to Parent’s obligation to close under this Agreement (the “Required Consents”), subject to the terms of Schedule 7.1(j). 




Section 7.2 Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders’ Meetings. (a) Proxy Statement. (i) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall, with reasonable assistance from Parent, prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, a proxy statement of the Company in connection with seeking the Company Shareholder Approval (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Proxy Statement”). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Parent shall furnish all information concerning it as may reasonably be requested by the Company in connection with such actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company (A) will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to shareholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement and (B) shall, within a reasonable period after the initial filing of the Proxy Statement, promptly commence a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act. (ii) All filings by the Company or Parent with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and all mailings to the shareholders of the Company in connection with the Merger shall be subject to the prior review of and consent by Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. (iii) The Company shall (A) as promptly as practicable notify Parent of (1) the receipt of any comments from the SEC and all other written correspondence and oral communications with the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement and (2) any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect thereto and (B) supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger (other than with respect to the Spin-Off Registration Statement). (iv) Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that none of the information supplied by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the Company and at the time of the meeting of the shareholders of the Company (the “Company Shareholders’ Meeting”) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.   62

(v) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case, by the Company (with the reasonable assistance of Parent). (b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the Company’s bylaws and the rules of the NYSE to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders’ Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the shareholders of the Company for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall, subject to Section 7.3, (i) recommend to its shareholders the adoption of this Agreement and include in the Proxy Statement mailed to the shareholders of the Company such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit such adoption and obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Once the Company Shareholders’ Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders’ Meeting without the consent of Parent other than (x) to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its shareholders in advance of a vote on the adoption of this Agreement, or (y) if, as of the time for which the Company Shareholders’ Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting; provided that in the case of either clause (x) or (y), the Company Shareholders’ Meeting shall only be adjourned or postponed for a minimum period of time reasonable under the circumstances (it being understood that any such adjournment or postponement shall not affect the Company’s obligation to hold the Company Shareholders’ Meeting as aforesaid). The Company shall ensure that the Company Shareholders’ Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Shareholders’ Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company’s obligations pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 9.1(d)(ii). (c) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 7.3(e), (i) the Company Board shall recommend that its shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Shareholders’ Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Company Board has recommended that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Shareholders’ Meeting and (iii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of its board of directors that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. 




Section 7.3 No Solicitation by the Company. (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 7.3, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit and use reasonable best efforts to cause any of its officers, directors, employees or Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or   63

knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or continue in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) any nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or afford access to its business, properties, assets, books or records to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective representatives), in connection with any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or make any public statement approving, endorsing or recommending, a Company Acquisition Proposal or, subject to Section 7.3(e), effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (iv) enter into any letter of intent, merger agreement or other similar agreement providing for a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each an “Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement”), (v) submit any Company Acquisition Proposal to a vote of the shareholders of the Company or (vi) authorize, commit, resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. (b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(a) or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives an unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal not resulting, in whole or in part, from a breach of this Section 7.3, that the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (i) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal and (ii) failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may, in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, furnish nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group (or any of their Representatives or potential financing sources) making such Company Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group and their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that (x) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or group or their respective Representatives, the Company enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (y) promptly (but not more than two (2) Business Days) after furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company’s Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal solely to determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal and (B) inform a Person or group that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making, a Company Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this Section 7.3. (c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent in writing after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or could reasonably be expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making the proposal, request or offer, the material terms and conditions of any such proposal, request or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, regarding any material changes to the status and material terms of any such proposal, request or offer (including any material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof), but in no event later than one (1) Business Day after any such material change.   64

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its Representatives to, immediately (i) cease any existing discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) terminate access for any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) to the Data Room and (iii) request the return or destruction of any non-public information provided to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) in connection with a potential Company Acquisition Proposal who has received access to information within the past twelve months. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to enforce its rights under the provisions of any “standstill” agreement between the Company and any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives), and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or modification to, any such agreement, to permit such Person to submit a Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a Person to orally request the waiver of a “standstill” or similar obligation or from granting such a waiver, in each case, to the extent the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law so long as the Company promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day thereafter) notifies Parent thereof (including the identity of such counterparty) of such waiver or release. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited after the date of this Agreement and that did not result from a material breach of this Section 7.3, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) and concurrently pay the fee required by Section 9.3 in order to enter into a definitive agreement in connection with a Superior Company Proposal) if: (i)(A) a Company Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn prior to such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) there has been an Intervening Event; (ii) in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal; and (iii) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws. (f) Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into any Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement, (i) the Company Board shall provide Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and attaching a copy of any proposed agreements for the Superior Company Proposal, if applicable, it being understood that the delivery of such notice shall not itself constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) during the four (4) Business Days following such written notice, the Company Board and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Company Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, as would enable the Company Board to maintain the Company Board Recommendation and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior Company Proposal, terminate this Agreement; and (iii) at the end of the four (4) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable (A) the Company Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Company Proposal or (B) the Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.   65
















________________




(g) Nothing contained in this Section 7.3 shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to their shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any legally required disclosure to its shareholders required pursuant to applicable Law if the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law; provided, however, that this Section 7.3(g) shall not permit the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent otherwise permitted by this Section 7.3. For the avoidance of doubt, any “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 




Section 7.4 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall share their respective initial press releases with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby with each other and such releases shall be subject to consent of the other party. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public statement relating to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall provide, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, an opportunity to the other Party to review and comment on such press release or other announcement in advance, and shall give reasonable consideration to all reasonable comments suggested thereto. None of the limitations set forth in this Section 7.4 shall apply to any disclosure of any information (a) in connection with or following a Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Recommendation Change and matters related thereto pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and condition of this Agreement, (b) in connection with any dispute between the Parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this Section 7.4, (d) that is not confidential information of any other Party with financial analysts, investors and media representatives in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with its past practice in compliance with applicable Laws or (e) in the case of the Company, as reasonably necessary for the Company to effect the redemption of the Company Notes as contemplated in Section 7.13(a). 




Section 7.5 Notices of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify and provide copies to the other of (a) any material written notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority or securities exchange in connection with the Separation, the Distribution or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) any Proceeding or investigation, commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) result in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied, or (d) the occurrence of any effect, event, change, occurrence or circumstance which would or would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) result in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied, or (iii) result in an inaccuracy of any of its own representations or warranties in a manner that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as applicable, not to be satisfied at the Closing.   66

Section 7.6 Access to Information. (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, upon reasonable advance notice and subject to applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, to all of its and its Subsidiaries’ properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records, assets, officers and employees and, during such period the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish to Parent all other information concerning it, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective businesses, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided that the Company may restrict the foregoing access and the disclosure of information to the extent that, in its good faith judgment, (i) any Law applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, (ii) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, (iii) disclosure of any such information or document could result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, (iv) such access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (v) such information is primarily related to the SpinCo Entities, SpinCo Assets, SpinCo Liabilities or the SpinCo Business. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. (b) Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to (i) within sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, engage an environmental consulting firm to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment and Compliance Review, as such terms are commonly understood (the “Phase I Environmental Assessment”), and (ii) order a Phase II environmental review or any other test, investigation or review recommended in the Phase I Environmental Assessment (provided Company and Parent reasonably agree with such recommendation); provided, that such environmental assessment, test, investigation or review shall be conducted only (w) during regular business hours, (x) with no less than two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Company, (y) in a manner which will not unduly interfere with the operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the use of access to or egress from any real property and (z) with respect to leased real property, shall only be done if the owner of such property consents. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to undertake to obtain such consents as promptly as practicable if requested by Parent. Completion of any environmental assessments (or the results thereof) is not a condition for the Closing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remediate any environmental condition that is identified in any such assessment in respect of Owned Real Property at its sole cost and expense prior to Closing if such condition requires current remediation under applicable Environmental Law; provided, however, that the completion of any such remediation shall not be a condition to Closing.

In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Parent Commitment Letter permitted pursuant to this Section 7.11(b), such new commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the “Parent Financing” and deemed to be the “Parent Commitment Letter” for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly (and in any event no later than one (1) Business Day) deliver to the Company true, correct and complete copies of any   69

(c) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the Parent Commitment Letter that are required to have been paid at or prior to the Effective Time.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes of determining any exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of this Agreement or the disclosure of any matters on the Company Disclosure Letter, the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of this Agreement (other than Section 3.10(a)) shall be deemed not to include any reference therein to “Company Material Adverse Effect” and, in place of the “Material Adverse Effect” qualifier, such representations and warranties shall be qualified by “material” or “materially”, as applicable. The listing of any matter on the Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or Parent, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be disclosed by the Company or Parent, as applicable, under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever and the inclusion of an item relating to the SpinCo Business, SpinCo Assets or SpinCo Liabilities does not, in and of itself, establish that such item relates to or affects RemainCo or the RemainCo Business (which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement). No disclosure in the Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by the Company or Parent, as applicable, of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.   84

(b) Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall automatically become immediately vested and shall, as of the Merger Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and cease to represent a right with respect to shares of Company Stock, and shall be converted, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into the right to receive such holder’s pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration, as calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement. 




(c) Each Company Share-Based Award shall automatically become fully vested, and all vesting restrictions shall lapse, and, in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Share-Based Award, entitle the holder thereof to such holder’s pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration, as calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

This Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (this “Amendment”) is made and entered into as of June 2, 2021, by and among Meredith Corporation, an Iowa corporation (the “Company”), Gray Television, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“Parent”) and Gray Hawkeye Stations, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub is sometimes referred to herein as a “Party” and, collectively, as the “Parties.” 


RECITALS 


A. The Parties entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 3, 2021 (the “Agreement”). 


B. The Agreement, pursuant to Section 10.2 thereof, may be amended by written agreement of the Parties. 


C. The Parties desire to amend the Agreement in order to reflect certain additional understandings reached among the Parties. 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Amendment, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows: 


Section 1. Interpretation. This Amendment is made and delivered pursuant to the Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. 


Section 2. Amendments to the Agreement. 


(A) The definition of “Merger Consideration” in the first Recital of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated to replace the words “$14.51 in cash” with “$16.99 in cash”. 


(B) The following sentence shall be added to the end of Section 3.9: 


“The Company has provided to Parent all written documentation and all other material information relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal received by the Company from the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal after May 3, 2021 and prior to June 2, 2021.”








________________


(C) Section 7.3(c) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 


“The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent in writing after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or could reasonably be expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making the proposal, request or offer, the material terms and conditions of any such proposal, request or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request, and any and all written documents and other materials provided to the Company by the Person making such proposal, request or offer in connection with any such proposal, request or offer received. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, regarding any material changes to the status and material terms of any such proposal, request or offer (including any material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof), and shall provide to Parent all related documentation received by the Company in connection therewith, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day after any such material change.” 


(D) Section 7.3(f) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 


“Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into any Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement, (i) the Company Board shall provide Parent at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and attaching a copy of any proposed agreements for the Superior Company Proposal, if applicable, it being understood that the delivery of such notice shall not itself constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) during the five (5) Business Days following such written notice, the Company Board and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Company Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, as would enable the Company Board to maintain the Company Board Recommendation and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior Company Proposal, terminate this Agreement; and (iii) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification   2








________________


of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable (A) the Company Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Company Proposal or (B) the Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.” 


(E) Section 9.2 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 


“In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made. In the event of the termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 9.1, this Agreement shall be terminated and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any Party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such Party), other than the Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 9.2, Section 9.3, and Article X, which provisions shall survive such termination; provided, however, that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.11(e), Section 9.3 and Section 10.12, nothing in this first sentence of Section 9.2 shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination or the requirement to make the payments set forth in Section 9.3. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties hereto agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where (i) the Company Termination Fee or the Financing Failure Termination Fee is payable by the Company to Parent or (ii) the Parent Termination Fee is payable by Parent to the Company, if such amount referenced in the foregoing clause (i) or (ii), as the case may be, is paid in full, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.3(a)(i), the receipt of such amount by the receiving party shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and such party (A) shall be precluded from any other remedy against any other party hereto, at law or in equity or otherwise and (B) shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against any of the other parties hereto, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of this Agreement (including any Willful Breach but excluding fraud). Each party acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company   3

Termination Fee or the Financing Failure Termination Fee on more than one occasion (except, for the avoidance of doubt, as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.3(a)(i)) nor shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement.” 


(F) Section 9.3(a)(i) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 


“In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i), or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii), then, in each case, the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a fee in the amount of $113,000,000 at or prior to the termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) or as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) (the “Company Termination Fee”), or (B) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) if, at the time of such termination, (1) each of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 (other than the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(e)) and Section 8.3, other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions at Closing, has been satisfied or waived, and (2) each of the conditions to the Distribution (as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement) set forth in Section 3.3 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, other than the conditions set forth in Section 3.3(d) and Section 3.3(e) of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, has been satisfied or waived, then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a fee in the amount of $73,000,000 as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination) (the “Financing Failure Termination Fee”). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will both a Company Termination Fee and a Financing Failure Termination Fee be payable in connection with the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event a Financing Failure Termination Fee is actually paid, a Company Termination Fee (net of any Financing Failure Termination Fee previously paid) may become payable pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(ii).”   4

(G) Section 9.3(a)(ii) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 


“In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) or Section 9.1(b)(iii), or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) in respect of a Willful Breach by the Company of a covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, and in each case at any time after the date of this Agreement prior to such termination (A) a Company Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company and publicly announced or otherwise disclosed and has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement (or (I) prior to the Company Shareholders’ Meeting in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii) or (II) prior to the applicable breach giving rise to the termination right in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii)) and provided that the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders’ Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof)) and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company (x) enters into an agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal and such Company Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated or (y) consummates a Company Acquisition Proposal, then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Company Termination Fee, less the amount of any Parent Expenses, or the Financing Failure Termination Fee, as applicable, previously paid by the Company, concurrently with the consummation of such transaction arising from such Company Acquisition Proposal (and in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such consummation); provided, however, that for purposes of the definition of “Company Acquisition Proposal” in this Section 9.3(a)(ii), references to “20%” and “80%” shall be replaced by “50%”.” 


(H) Section 9.3(b) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 


“If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the documented out of pocket costs and expenses, including any commitment fees under the Commitment Letter and the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, Parent Financing Sources, experts and consultants, incurred by Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 (the “Parent Expenses”) as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination).”

damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (iii) the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iv) that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.” 


(J) The last sentence of Section 9.3(d) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 


“In no event shall a Company Termination Fee, a Parent Termination Fee or a Financing Failure Termination be payable more than once (except, for the avoidance of doubt, as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.3(a)(i)).” 


(K) Section 9.3(e) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 


“Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to Section 10.12, (i) in the event that this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Financing Failure Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 9.3, the payment of the Company Termination Fee or, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.3(a)(i), the Financing Failure Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or Representatives (the “Company Related Parties”) for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 9.3, the payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries and any of their   6








________________


respective former, current or future shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or Representatives (the “Parent Related Parties”) for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise , and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.” 


(L) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Amendment, Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the fully executed amended and restated debt commitment letter and associated fee letters dated the date hereof (with only the fee amount, economic flex, syndication levels and certain other economic terms redacted in a customary manner (none of which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect conditionality, enforceability or termination provisions of the debt commitment letter or reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Parent Financing)) (the “Amended Debt Commitment Letter”). As of the date of this Amendment, Parent hereby makes the representations and warranties in Section 4.9 of the Agreement (provided, however, that representations and warranties in Section 4.9 of the Agreement that are made as of the date of the Agreement shall be deemed to have been made as of the date hereof) with respect to the Amended Debt Commitment Letter and represents and warrants to the Company that each of the Parent Financing Sources have approved this Amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, from the execution of this Amendment, all references in the Agreement to the Parent Commitment Letter shall be deemed references to the Amended Debt Commitment Letter and all references to the Parent Financing shall be deemed to include the funding of the amounts contemplated by the Amended Debt Commitment Letter. 


Section 3. Miscellaneous. 


(A) Entire Agreement; Full Force and Effect. Except to the extent specifically amended herein or supplemented hereby, the Agreement remains unchanged and in full force and effect, and this Amendment will be governed by and subject to the terms of the Agreement, as amended by this Amendment (including Article X of the Agreement which is incorporated herein by reference). The Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to therein), as amended by this Amendment, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement. From and after the date of this Amendment, each reference in the Agreement to “this Agreement”, “hereof”, “hereunder”, “herein” or words of like import, and all references to the Agreement in any and all agreements, instruments, documents, notes, certificates and other writings of every kind of nature (other than this Amendment or as otherwise expressly provided) will be deemed to mean the Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, whether or not this Amendment is expressly referenced. 


(B) Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that each Party need not sign the same counterpart.   7

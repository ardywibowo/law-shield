WHEREAS, after considering such factors as the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) deems relevant, including the long-term prospects and interests of the Company and its shareholders, and the social, economic, legal, or other effects of any action on the employees, suppliers, customers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the communities and society in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, and the economy of the state and the nation, the Company Board has unanimously: (a) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company’s shareholders; (b) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, including the execution, delivery, and performance thereof, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; (c) directed that this Agreement be submitted to a vote of the Company’s shareholders for adoption at the Company Shareholders Meeting; and (d) resolved to recommend that Company shareholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the FBCA;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:   1








________________


ARTICLE I THE MERGER 


Section 1.01 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the FBCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”) whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue its existence under Florida law as the surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (sometimes referred to herein as the “Surviving Corporation”). 


Section 1.02 Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at 10:00 a.m. local time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days) after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; provided that, subject to Parent’s waiver in its sole discretion, in no event shall the Closing Date be prior to August 20, 2021. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022 (provided that the Closing may take place by conference call and electronic delivery (e.g., email/PDF) of signatures), unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, and the actual date of the Closing is hereinafter referred to as the “Closing Date”. 


Section 1.03 Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub shall file with the Department of State of the State of Florida articles of merger (the “Articles of Merger”), executed in accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the FBCA in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger have been filed with the Department of State of the State of Florida or at such time as may be agreed between the parties and specified in Articles of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the FBCA (such time is hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”). 


Section 1.04 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the FBCA. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all of the property, rights, powers, privileges, franchises of the Company and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company. 


Section 1.05 Articles of Incorporation; By-Laws. At the Effective Time: (a) the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated so as to to read substantially identically to the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated articles of incorporation will become the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the FCBA and such articles of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation will be “Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated”; and (b) the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, except that references to Merger Sub’s name shall be replaced with references to the Surviving Corporation’s name, until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, or as provided by applicable Law.   2








________________


Section 1.06 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger Sub, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation, or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 


ARTICLE II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; PAYMENT FOR SHARES 


Section 2.01 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company: (a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Cancelled Shares”) will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. (b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) will be converted into the right to receive $54.00 in cash, without interest thereon (the “Merger Consideration”). (c) Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and all shares of Company Common Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of: (i) a certificate formerly representing any shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”); or (ii) any book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Book-Entry Share”) will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof. (d) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers, and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub common stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.   3

Section 2.02 Surrender and Payment. (a) Paying Agent; Payment Fund . Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”) to act as the agent for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration for: (i) the Certificates; and (ii) the Book-Entry Shares. On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) (the “Payment Fund”) in amounts and at the times necessary for such payments. In connection therewith, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares shall be entitled under Section 2.01(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), whose Company Common Stock was converted pursuant to Section 2.01(b) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and which letter of transmittal will be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) for use in such exchange. (b) Procedures for Surrender; No Interest. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon: (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent; or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of thisArticle II, each Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, shall immediately be cancelled. (c) Investment of Payment Fund. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the cash in the Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in: (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States; (ii) short-term commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements, or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available); or (iv) money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a   4

recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. No losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. (d) Payments to Non-Registered Holders. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that: (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. (e ) Full Satisfaction. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in thisArticle II. (f ) Termination of Payment Fund . Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who h a s not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.02 (and Section 2.05 in the case of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates) prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration without any interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


Section 2.03 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, including the restrictions set forth in Section 5.01, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.   5








________________


Section 2.04 Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity by the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 


Section 2.05 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration due with respect thereto, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this Article II. 


Section 2.06 Treatment of Company Equity Awards. (a) Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units and Performance Stock Units. (i) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance Stock Unit that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest in full and become free of restrictions and shall be cancelled and converted automatically, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time (with any such Company Performance Stock Units deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of the Company Performance Stock Units granted) less any Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance Stock Unit in accordance with Section 2.04. (ii) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Merger Consideration described in Section 2.06(a)(i) to holders of Company Equity Awards through the payroll system or payroll provider of the Surviving Corporation (after giving effect to any required Tax withholding). If any payment of the Merger Consideration cannot be made through the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder (less applicable withholding Taxes), which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.   6








________________


(b) Company Stock Appreciation Rights. (i) At the Effective Time, each Company stock appreciation right (“Company SAR”) that is outstanding under any Company Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have all rights thereunder cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, and each former holder of any cancelled In-the-Money SAR, in exchange therefor shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the SAR Per Share Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money SAR, less any applicable withholding Taxes. Each Company SAR that is not an In-the-Money SAR shall be automatically cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time for no consideration. Following the Effective Time, no holder of any Company SAR shall have the right to acquire any equity interest in the Company or the Surviving Corporation in respect thereof. (ii) With respect to In-the-Money SARs held by employees, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deliver through its payroll system the consideration provided for bySection 2.06(b)(i) to such holder. If such payment cannot be made through the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date following thirty days after the Closing Date. With respect to non-employee holders of In-the-Money SARs, the Paying Agent shall pay to each such holder the consideration provided for herein following the Closing Date. (c) Resolutions and Other Company Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board, and the compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including, if appropriate, amending the Company Stock Plans and individual grant agreements and obtaining consents from the holders of the Company SARs and/or delivering the holders thereof notices thereto) necessary to give effect to the transactions provided for in this Section 2.06 and to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding Company SAR or a Company Restricted Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto and no participant in any other Company Benefit Plan will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries; and the termination as of the Effective Time of all Company Stock Plans and any other Company Benefit Plan providing for any equity interest in respect of the Company or its Subsidiaries.   7

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company, or other legal entity and is in good standing (to the extent that the concept of “good standing” is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States) in each jurisdiction where the character of the assets and properties owned, leased, or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or license necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. (b) The Company has made available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of the articles of incorporation, by-laws, or like organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that are a ‘significant subsidiary’ as su ch term is defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act (collectively, the “Charter Documents”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company or its Representatives. Section 4.04 Financial Capability. (a) Subject to the receipt of the Financing, Parent will have sufficient funds available to it for Parent to complete the transactions contemplated hereby, and to satisfy all of the obligations of Parent as and when contemplated by this Agreement and to pay or otherwise perform the obligations of Parent under any other agreements or documents entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the Commitment Letter, including paying the aggregate Merger Consideration at Closing, and any required refinancings or repayments of existing indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and paying all related fees and expenses. (b) Parent has received and accepted a fully executed commitment letter dated as of the date hereof (together with all exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, and as amended, supplemented or replaced in compliance with this Agreement, the “Commitment Letter”) from the lender named therein (the “Initial Lender”, and, collectively with any additional lenders or financing sources who become party to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements (including, in each case, by way of joinder or assignment), the “Lenders”) pursuant to which the Initial Lender has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide the amounts of debt financing set forth therein, and for the purposes described therein. The debt financing committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter is referred to in this Agreement as the “Financing”. (c) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Commitment Letter (and if certain terms of the debt financing commitment are set forth in a fee letter, Parent has provided to the Company, on a confidential basis, copies of such fee letter that have been redacted to delete any confidential compensation information, market flex provisions and fee amounts (none of which would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the Financing in any material respect or that would reduce the amount below an amount needed to make all payments required by this Agreement or materially delay or prevent the Closing). The Commitment Letter constitutes the entire and complete agreement of the parties thereto with respect to the Financing and as of the date of this Agreement there are no side letters or other contracts or arrangements (except for customary fee letters and engagement letters (none of which adversely affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the Financing in any material respect)) relating to the funding, of the full amount of, or the conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of, the Financing other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter.   30

(d ) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Initial Lender to provide the Financing or any terms or contingencies that would, or could reasonably be expected to, permit the Initial Lender t o reduce the total amount of the Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in ARTICLE VI, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date, nor to the knowledge of Parent, does Parent have any reason to believe that the Initial Lender will not perform its obligations thereunder. (e) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter, together with cash on hand, shall provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid by Parent pursuant to Article II at the Closing and any expenses incurred by Parent in connection therewith. Parent has not incurred, and is not contemplating or aware of, any obligation, commitment, restriction or other liability of any kind, in each case that would impair or adversely affect such resources, funds or capabilities. (f) The Commitment Letter is (i) a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, of each of the other parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions) (ii) in full force and effect, and (iii) does not contain any material misrepresentation by Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under the terms of the Commitment Letter, or otherwise result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Parent has irrevocably paid in full (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees and expenses required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement, and will continue to timely pay in full (or caused to be paid) any such amounts arising under the Commitment Letter as and when they become due and payable. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter has not been modified, amended, withdrawn or restated as of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter will not be amended or modified as of Closing Date except to the extent permitted by Section 5.17, and none of the respective commitments under any of the Commitment Letter has been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect (and no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated). Except as set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to the funding or investing, as applicable (except for customary fee letters and engagement letters and customary arrangements or agreements to syndicate a portion of the Financing), of the full amount of the Financing. There are no conditions precedent (x) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or any provisions that could reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter or the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter or (y) that could otherwise adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability or availability of the Commitment Letter with respect to all or any portion of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter in the form so delivered to the Company. As of the date hereof, no party to any Commitment Letter has any right to impose, and Parent and Merger Sub do not have an   31








________________


obligation to accept, (i) any condition precedent to the funding of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter or (ii) any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Commitment Letter at Closing (nor any term or condition that would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the Commitment Letter at Closing) to an amount that would be insufficient for the Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 


Section 4.05 Legal Proceedings. As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, Legal Action against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, nor is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling, or decree imposed upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, in each case, by or before any Governmental Entity, that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent’s and Merger Sub’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 4.06 Ownership of Company Common Stock. Neither Parent, Merger Sub or any of their stockholders, directors or executive officer is the beneficial owner of any shares of Company Common Stock. Section 4.07 Brokers. Except for fees payable to Lazard Frères SAS, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has incurred, nor will it incur, directly or indirectly, any liability for investment banker, brokerage, or finders’ fees or agents’ commissions, or any similar charges in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement for which the Company would be liable in connection the Merger. Section 4.08 Disclaimer of Reliance. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or any other Person has made or is making, and Parent and Merger Sub expressly disclaim reliance upon, any representations, warranties, or statements relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by the Company in Article III, including any implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that, except and only to the extent expressly set forth in Article III of this Agreement, no representations or warranties are made with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets, or prospect information that may have been made available to Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Representatives (including in certain “data rooms,” “virtual data rooms,” management presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall direct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions, or negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Takeover Proposal, including immediately terminating all access granted to any third party to any physical or electronic data room, and shall direct and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries to promptly return or destroy all such information. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that if any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, acting at the Company’s direction or with the Knowledge of the Company, take any action that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this Section 5.04, such action shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.04 by the Company.   38

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.04(a), if, at any time following the date hereof but prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.04, (i) the Company and its Representatives may engage in contact with the Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or to request that any Takeover Proposal made orally be made in writing; and (ii) if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Takeover Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, subject to Section 5.04(c), directly or indirectly through any Representative: (A) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal in writing; and (B) thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, subject to (x) first entering into an executed confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such third party and (y) the Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) providing to Parent any such non-public information in the event such information was not previously made available to Parent; but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from disclosing to the Company’s shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal, if the Company Board determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law, it being understood that (i) any such disclosure made by the Company Board must be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.04 and (ii) nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 5.04(d) and Section 5.04(e). (c) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and the Effective Time, the Company shall notify Parent in writing as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than two (2) calendar days) after it receives or, to the Knowledge of the Company, its Representatives receive, any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, any request f o r non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party. In such notice, the Company shall include (i) the identity of the third party making any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request, (ii) a copy of any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request made in writing and any other written terms and proposals provided (including financing commitments) to the Company or its Representatives, (iii) a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request not made in writing, and (iv) an indication of whether the Company or Company Board intends to take any of the actions referred to in clauses (ii)(A) and (B) of Section 5.04(b). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing obligations of the Company shall include an obligation to keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within one (1) Business Day of any material developments), of the status and material terms and developments of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof.   39

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.04, the Company Board shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a definitive written Company Acquisition Agreement in connection with such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, only if: (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least five (5) Business Days (the “Superior Proposal Notice Period”) before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) such definitive written Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly (A) that the Company has received a Takeover Proposal that has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) to the extent not previously provided to Parent pursuant to Section 5.04(c) (and without limiting the obligations under Section 5.04(c)), the material terms of such Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal and copies of all agreements, proposals and other documents (including financing commitments) relating to such Takeover Proposal; and (C) that the Company Board intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.04(a) absent revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or such termination; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or such termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, elects to engage in such negotiations (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Superior Proposal Notice Period, there is any revision in price or any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remain in the Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such revision in price or material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions and that all notice obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.04(c) and this Section 5.04(d) shall apply with respect to each such revision in price or material revision)); (iii) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.04 with respect to such Takeover Proposal and (iv) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its Company Financial Advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Superior Proposal Notice Period to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in response to an Intervening Event that has occurred after the date of this Agreement but prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if: (i) prior to effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least five (5) Business Days (the “Intervening Event Notice Period”) before taking such action of its intent to consider such action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), and which notice shall include a reasonably detailed   40

description of the underlying facts giving rise to the Intervening Event, and the reasons for taking, such action; (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board would no longer determine underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for taking such action, ceases to constitute an Intervening Event, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material development in an Intervening Event, the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remains in the Intervening Event Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material development (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)); (iii) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.04(e) with respect to such Intervening Event and (iv) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its Company Financial Advisor, that the failure to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Intervening Event Notice Period, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that any Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected (or proposed to be effected) in response to or in connection with any Takeover Proposal may be made solely and exclusively pursuant to Section 5.04(d) only, and may not be made pursuant to this Section 5.04(e), and any Company Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made pursuant to thisSection 5.04 and no other provisions of this Agreement. 


Section 5.05 Shareholder Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Materials; Approval by Sole Shareholder of Merger Sub. (a) The Company shall take all action necessary to conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act, establish a record date, duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting, in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (and shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting without the consent of Parent), and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the Company Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock in advance of such meeting. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.04 hereof, the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to Section 5.04 hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) solicit from the holders o f Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger; and (ii) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to obtain such approval. (b) In connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days) the Company shall prepare and file the preliminary Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file the Company Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto,   41

without providing Parent and its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company) and the Company agrees that all information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries included in the Proxy Statement shall be in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve, and each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Company Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Company Proxy Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Company’s shareholders as promptly as commercially reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to consult with Parent prior to responding to SEC comments with respect to the preliminary Company Proxy Statement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading and the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its shareholders an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction (to the extent such correction is material and a filing alone with the SEC of such correction would not be sufficient). The Company shall as soon as commercially reasonably practicable: (i) notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Company Proxy Statement or for additional information; and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy Statement. (c) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, in accordance with applicable Law. 


Section 5.06 Notices of Certain Events; Shareholder Litigation; No Effect on Disclosure Letter. (a) The Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company, promptly of: (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the material consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any material notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) any event, change, or effect between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01, Section 6.02(a), Section 6.02(b), or Section 6.02(c) of this Agreement (in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Section 6.01, Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) of this Agreement (in the case of Parent and Merger Sub), to be satisfied. (b) Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, each party shall promptly advise the other in writing after becoming aware of any Legal Action commenced after the date hereof against Parent, the Company or any of its directors by any shareholder of the Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and shall keep the other party reasonably informed regarding any such Legal Action. Each party shall give the other party the opportunity to consult and participate in any such Legal Action regarding the defense or settlement of any such Legal Action, and shall consider such party’s views and comments with respect to such Legal Action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section   42

5.01, the Company shall not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any such Legal Action unless Parent has provided its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). For purposes of this Section 5.06(b), “participate” means that each party will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions by the other party with respect to Legal Actions (to the extent that attorney-client privilege between such party and its counsel is not impaired; it being understood that the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to enter into arrangements to avoid impairing privilege), and each party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Legal Actions but will not be afforded any decision-making power over such Legal Action prior to the Effective Time, except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above and except that each party shall take into account such other party’s recommendations in good faith. (c) In no event shall: (i) the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to Section 5.06(a) limit or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties under this Agreement; or (ii) disclosure by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 5.06(a) be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Letter or constitute an exception to any representation or warranty. Section 5.06(a) shall not constitute a covenant or agreement for purposes of Section 6.02(b) or Section 6.03(b). 


Section 5.07 Employees; Benefit Plans. (a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date which is twelve months from the Effective Time (or if earlier, the date of the employee’s termination of employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time (collectively, the “Company Continuing Employees”) with annual base salary or wage level, annual target bonus opportunities, and employee benefits (excluding, any U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans, any non-qualified deferred compensation plans or programs, and any equity compensation arrangements, the “Excluded Benefits”) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the annual base salary or wage level, annual target bonus opportunities, and employee benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement. (b) With respect to any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding the Excluded Benefits (collectively, “Parent Benefit Plans”) in which any Company Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Effective Time, and subject to the terms of the governing plan documents, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be as if such service were with Parent, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual, except for vacation, if applicable) for full or partial years of service in any Parent Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; provided, that such service shall not be credited to the extent that: (i) such crediting would result in a duplication of benefits; or (ii) such service was not credited under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.   43

(c) If Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, that it has determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company and taking into account the Company’s recommendation in good faith) to terminate the Company’s Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, the Company, shall one (1) Business Day prior to the Effective Time, adopt resolutions terminating any such Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company and Parent become members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code). The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and the Company shall provide evidence that such resolutions have been adopted by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. (d) This Section 5.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.07, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, any beneficiary, or any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.07. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement; (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify, or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement, o r arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored, or maintained by any of them; or (iii) shall prevent the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Company Continuing Employee following the Effective Time. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.07 shall not create any right in any Company Employee or any other Person to any continued employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, or otherwise alters any existing at-will employment relationship between any Company Employee and the Surviving Corporation. (e) With respect to matters described in this Agreement, including this Section 5.07, the Company will not send any written notices or other written communication materials to Company Employees without the prior written consent of Parent. 


Section 5.08 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance. (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree to cause the Surviving Corporation to assure that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an “Indemnified Party”) for any acts or omissions by such Indemnified Party occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Charter Documents of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in Section 5.08 of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of expenses at least as favorable to the provisions of the Charter Documents of the Company as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with   44

respect to acts or omissions by any Indemnified Party occurring prior to the Effective Time, and shall not (except as required by applicable Law) amend, repeal, or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party; provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim made for indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. (b) The Company shall obtain as of the Effective Time “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts as in the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof (“D&O Insurance”) and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the “D&O Tail Policy”); provided that in no event shall the cost of the D&O Tail Policy exceed 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the D&O Insurance. During the term of the D&O Tail Policy, Parent shall not (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) take any action following the Closing to cause the D&O Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to be amended or waived. (c) The obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.08 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.08 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.08 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.08, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.08). (d) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of its applicable obligations set forth in this Section 5.08. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to, or shall release, waive, or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors, and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.08 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. (e) The Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 5.08 in connection with the valid and successful enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 5.08.   45

Section 5.09 Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including those contained in this Section 5.09), each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than the Outside Date), including: (i) the obtaining of all necessary Permits, waivers, and actions or nonactions from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities; and (ii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, subject to applicable Law, promptly: (A) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) immediately above; and (B) supply the other with any information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the taking of such actions. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law and by any applicable Governmental Entity, provide the other party’s counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend and participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing made thereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither party hereto shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Entity where material issues are reasonably expected to be discussed in connection with this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby unless, so long as reasonably practicable and permitted by applicable Law, it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Each party hereto shall furnish the other party with copies of all material correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby, and furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity; provided, however, that each party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive materials provided pursuant to this Section 5.09 as “outside counsel only,” and provided further that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of Company or Parent and the transaction contemplated hereby or other confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. The parties shall discuss in advance the strategy and timing for obtaining any clearances required under Antitrust Laws; provided, however, that (but, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the Company’s consultation and participation rights described above,Section 5.05(b), Section 5.06(b) and Section 5.09(d)), Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, (but only to the extent relating to the matters that occur from and after the Closing or that would be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing) devise and lead all meetings, communications, negotiations and strategy (including defense strategy) for dealing with   46

any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining all consents, approvals, clearances and other authorizations of any Governmental Entity set forth on Section 6.01 of the Company Disclosure Letter, satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(b), and any matters that otherwise relate to Antitrust Laws in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing sentence shall (x) give Parent the right to control or lead on matters unrelated to this Agreement or unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (y) require the Company to take or agree to take any action (including any disposition, licensing, holding separate or conduct remedy) or to limit or agree to limit the Company’s freedom of action in any respect unless, as set forth in Section 5.09(d) below, the effectiveness of any such agreement, action or limitation is conditioned upon (and such action or limitation takes effect following) the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Parent’s obligations to take or cause to take any actions described in this Section 5.09, shall be subject, in each case, to the right of Parent, in Parent’s good faith reasonable discretion, to take reasonable periods of time in order to advocate and negotiate with Governmental Entities with respect to such actions, and (B) subject to the Company’s consultation and participation rights described above, if there are multiple alternative actions or remedies which may result in obtaining any consents, approvals, clearances and other authorizations of a n y Governmental Entity set forth on Section 6.01 of the Company Disclosure Letter and satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(b), then Parent shall have sole discretion over which alternative actions or remedies to propose (to the extent that no such remedies take effect prior to the Closing without the Company’s consent). (b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant toSection 5.09(a) hereof, the parties hereto shall: (i) provide or cause to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Entity, a “Governmental Antitrust Authority”) information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper, or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than the Outside Date), including preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (provided, that in the case of the filing under the HSR Act, such filing shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) and thereafter to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any request for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws; and (ii) subject to the terms set forth in Section 5.09(d) hereof, use their reasonable best efforts to promptly take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting periods as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than the Outside Date). (c ) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall, subject to Section 5.09(d), cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby from occurring prior to the Outside Date.   47

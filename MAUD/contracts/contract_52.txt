Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of Merger I and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub I or the Company, or the holder of any share of Company Common Stock: (a) Conversion of Merger Sub I Common Stock. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. (b) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock.

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (A) the Excluded Shares and (B) the Dissenting Shares will, by virtue of Merger I and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (i) $28.00 in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash, the “Per Share Cash Consideration”) and (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Parent Common Stock”), equal to the Exchange Ratio (such amount of Parent Common Stock, the “Per Share Stock Consideration”) and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.3(e) (the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration the “Merger Consideration”).   4








________________


(d) Treatment of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) shall automatically be converted into and thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificates have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1. (e) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c), but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the “fair value” of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL); provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and actions with respect to such demands at Parent’s sole expense. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, (ii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL, or (iii) agree to do any of the foregoing. (f) Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or the securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be (including the treatment of Company Equity Awards in Section 2.4), shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   5

Section 2.2 Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”), the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement relating to the Exchange Agent’s responsibilities with respect thereto, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. 


Section 2.3 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, (i) shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing the full number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to pay the aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration and (ii) all of the cash necessary to pay the aggregated Per Share Cash Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3(c) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.3(e). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Parent Common Stock and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. (b) Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time), to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form as prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or duly executed affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or duly executed affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent (and reasonably acceptable to the Company), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash and the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.3(e), and the   6

Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Any holder of any Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal or any other deliverables to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time), the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.3(e), and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(c), and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith cancelled. (c) Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or conversion of Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.3(b), there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or delivery, as the case may be, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender or delivery, as the case may be, and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or delivery payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c). After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   7








________________


(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated, and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled under Section 2.1 (or would be entitled but for this Section 2.3(e)) and (ii) the Parent Stock Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without interest, to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.3(c).

Immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.3(c) in respect of a share of Common Stock would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such share of Company Common Stock shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided, that no monetary losses on such investment thereof shall affect the Merger Consideration payable hereunder and, following any such losses, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, in the amount of such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that remains payable.

Section 2.4 Company Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (whether vested or unvested) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Company Equity Award Consideration over (y) the exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, less applicable Tax withholdings. In the event the per share exercise price of a Company Option is equal to or greater than the Company Equity Award Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without the payment of any consideration therefor. (b) At the Effective Time, each (i) Company RSU granted prior to the date of this Agreement that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) each 2021 Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by an Accelerated RSU Holder, will vest as of the Effective Time and shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company RSU or 2021 Company RSU, as applicable, becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the Company Equity Award Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU or 2021 Company RSU, as applicable. (c) At the Effective Time, with respect to each 2021 Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by an individual who is not an Accelerated RSU Holder, such 2021 Company RSU shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed and converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an “Adjusted RSU”) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such 2021 Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Company Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Any fractional shares that result from the foregoing calculation shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and the remaining shares (or fractional shares) of Company Common Stock represented by such 2021 Company RSU that have not been converted into Adjusted RSUs, will be paid in cash as Company Equity Award Consideration. Each such Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding 2021 Company RSU under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the applicable award agreement issued thereunder, including vesting terms.   9

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that (i) any offering period or purchase period under the Company ESPP that otherwise would be in progress as of the Effective Time, will be terminated and the final exercise date shall be no later than the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the “Final Exercise Date”); (ii) any adjustments that may be necessary shall be made to reflect such shortened offering period or purchase period, but that such shortened offering period or purchase period shall be treated as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the Company ESPP; (iii) each Company ESPP participant’s accumulated contributions under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date; and (iv) subject to the consummation of Merger I, the Company ESPP shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Adjusted RSUs, including, effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Adjusted RSUs.   10

(f) The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in Section 5.3(e) unless the Company has (i) provided written notice to Parent (a “Notice of Company Superior Proposal”) informing Parent that the Company has determined that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Company Superior Proposal and providing a copy of the draft agreement intended to effect such Company Superior Proposal, (ii) for the four (4) Business Day period following Parent’s receipt of the Notice of Company Superior Proposal (the “Company Superior Proposal Notice Period”), permitted Parent to make counteroffers or proposals, including to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement (to the extent Parent wishes to do so), and (iii) after complying with clauses (i) and (ii), determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors and taking into account any such counteroffer or proposed amendment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) that such Company Acquisition Proposal remains a Company Superior Proposal; provided, however, that if during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period any revisions are made to a Company Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are material (it being understood and agreed that any change to consideration with respect to such proposal is material), the Company shall deliver a new Notice of Company Superior Proposal to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(f) with respect to such new Notice of Company Superior Proposal (except that the “four (4) Business Day” period referred to in clause (ii) of this proviso shall instead be a two (2) Business Day period). (g) Other than in connection with circumstances involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.3(e) and Section 5.3(f) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.3(g)), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, in response to a Company Intervening Event if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company has first notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(g), (iii) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(g), the Company shall have permitted Parent   54

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company Board from (A) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its positions thereunder, or (B) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to approve, endorse or recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal, unless, in connection therewith, the Company Board effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.3(e) or Section 5.3(g); provided, further that any such disclosure (other than a “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type communicated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or a Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless (i) the Company Board in connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Company Board, without disclosing any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii) the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation and rejects any Company Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after any such disclosure. (i) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify, or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Recommendation (a “Parent Adverse Recommendation Change”); provided that prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, in response (x) to a Parent Intervening Event, or (y) an unsolicited Parent Acquisition Proposal (where Parent did not, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or encourage the making, submission or announcement of such Parent Acquisition Proposal) if (i) the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Parent’s outside counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) Parent has first notified the Company in writing that it intends to effect such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(i), (iii) for a period of four (4) Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(i), Parent shall have permitted the Company to make proposals to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement (to the extent the Company wishes to do so) so that the failure   55

Nothing contained in this Section 5.3(i) shall prohibit the Parent Board from making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Parent’s outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Parent Board’s fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Parent under applicable Law; provided, however, that any such disclosure that addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Parent Board with respect to this Agreement or a Parent Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Parent Board in connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Parent Board, without disclosing any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. (j) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) “Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a confidentiality agreement that contains terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that a Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement shall not be required to contain any standstill or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Company Acquisition Proposal and does not restrict in any material respect the Company and its Representatives from complying with its disclosure obligations under this Agreement. (ii) “Company Acquisition Proposal” shall mean a proposal or offer from any Person other than Parent providing for any (A) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company, pursuant to which any such Person (including such Person’s or resulting company’s direct or indirect stockholders) would own or control, directly or indirectly, fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power or equity of the Company, (B) sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, of assets of the Company (including the capital stock or other equity interests of any of its Subsidiaries) and/or any Subsidiary of the Company representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets, revenues or net income of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, (C) issuance or sale or other disposition of capital stock or other equity interests representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (D) tender offer, exchange offer or any other transaction or series of transactions in which any Person would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of capital stock or other equity interests representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the Company of any group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, fifteen percent (15%)or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (E) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than Merger I and Merger II).   56

(iii) “Company Superior Proposal” means any Company Acquisition Proposal on terms which, in the good faith determination of the Company Board (after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor and outside legal counsel), are more favorable, taken as a whole, from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the Transactions; provided, that for purposes of this definition, references to “fifteen percent (15%)” in the definition of “Company Acquisition Proposal” shall be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%)”.

Parent or the Company, as applicable, will notify the other promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with Merger I for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication received from the SEC or any state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared promptly and, after the other party has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, shall be filed promptly with the SEC, and, to the extent required by   57

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, and no party hereto shall fail to take or cause to be taken any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of the following sentences, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to, and no Acquired Company shall, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree to any material modification to or material accommodation under any Contract or pay any material fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within twenty (20) Business Days from the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other commercially reasonable actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act, (ii) if required, appropriate filings under any Regulatory Law as soon as reasonably practicable and (iii) any other necessary, proper or advisable registrations, filings and notices.

(c) In addition, if any action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened) challenging the Transactions as violating any Regulatory Law or if any decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) is entered, enforced, or attempted to be entered or enforced by any Governmental Entity that would make the Transactions illegal or otherwise delay or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions, Parent and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall take any and all actions to contest and defend any such claim, cause of action, or proceeding to avoid entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, repealed, rescinded, or terminated, any decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Transaction. (d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.6(a), Section 5.6(b) and Section 5.6(c) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law and to make any other necessary, proper, or advisable registrations, filings and notices, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any Action initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly notify the other party of any substantive communication made or received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, from any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any Action by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions (iii) subject to applicable Law, permit the other party a reasonable opportunity to review any substantive written communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any scheduled substantive meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or party, and (iv) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Transactions unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend or participate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other side under this Section 5.6(d) as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause its respective counsel to comply with this Section 5.6(d).

hereby prior to the Outside Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of Parent or its Affiliates shall, and shall not cause any Person to, acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any assets of or any equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof, if that acquisition or agreement would reasonably be expected to: (i) materially increase the risk of not obtaining approval under any Regulatory Law or the expiration or termination of any waiting period in connection with applicable Regulatory Law; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers or materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iii) prevent or materially delay receipt of any applicable Regulatory Law approval. (f) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as required by this Agreement, the Company and its Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered into by the Company or any of its Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Outside Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Company or its Affiliates shall, and shall not cause any Person to, acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any assets of or any equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof, if that acquisition or agreement would reasonably be expected to: (i) materially increase the risk of not obtaining approval under any Regulatory Law or the expiration or termination of any waiting period in connection with applicable Regulatory Law; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers or materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iii) prevent or materially delay receipt of any applicable Regulatory Law approval. (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.6 to the contrary, Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to propose, negotiate or commit to sell, divest, exclusively license, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of, accept any material operational restrictions or take or commit to take any actions (including supply and other commercial arrangements) which restrictions or actions would limit Parent’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ freedom of action with respect to, assets, licenses, product lines, operations or businesses of Parent or the Acquired Companies that, individually or in the aggregate, generated total annual revenues in excess of one-hundred and fifty million dollars ($150,000,000) (taking into account intra-company sales) in the Company’s or Parent’s, as applicable, fiscal year 2020. 


Section 5.7 Employee Matters. (a) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending twelve (12) months later (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to, provide to each employee of the Acquired Companies who is employed immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”), for so long as such Continuing Employee remains in the employment of Parent and its Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period, (i)   62

compensation (such term to include salary or base rate of compensation, annual cash bonus opportunities and commissions) that is in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses, severance and nonqualified deferred compensation) being provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) benefits that are in the aggregate, no less favorable than the benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension plans or retiree medical benefits) being provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that with respect to defined contribution plans and employee stock purchase plans, such benefits will be no less favorable than the benefits being provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries), and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those in effect with respect to such Continuing Employee as of the date hereof. (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts so that each Continuing Employee is provided full credit for prior service with the Acquired Companies to the extent such service would be recognized if it had been performed as an employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any Parent Employee Plans but not for benefit accrual purposes of any of the Parent Employee Plans, or for purposes of determining retirement eligibility under any equity or equity based award granted in connection with the Transactions; provided that such crediting is permitted under the terms of such plans (including, without limitation the Parent Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Stock Advantage Plan)), and applicable law and does not result in duplication of benefits, and (ii) unless covered under another arrangement with or of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company, determination of benefit levels under any Parent Employee Plan or policy of general application in each case relating to paid time off or severance, in either case, for which the Continuing Employees are otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employees are offered participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be retroactively eligible for any Parent Employee Plan, including any such Parent Employee Plan that was frozen prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Parent Employee Plan” means any employee benefit plan that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to (or required to be contributed to) by any Parent Company, including, without limitation, any “employee pension benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) or “employee welfare benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA). The Company shall provide Parent or its designee all information reasonably requested to allow Parent to comply with such obligations in this Section 5.7(b). (c) Without limiting the foregoing, if the Continuing Employees participate in any Parent Employee Plan that provides medical, dental, vision or prescription drug benefits, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts (or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Company) to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition, actively at work, waiting period and similar requirements and (ii) cause the Parent Employee Plans to honor any expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any corresponding Company Plan during the portion of the calendar year up to the date that coverage under a Company Plan is replaced with coverage under such Parent Employee Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. The Company shall provide Parent or its designee all information reasonably requested to allow Parent to comply with such obligations in this Section 5.7(c).   63

(d) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective on the Closing Date (and contingent upon the Closing), any Company Plan set forth on Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter effective as of the date set forth therein, unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any such Company Plan by providing the Company with written notice of such election at least thirty (30) days before the Effective Time. Unless Parent so provides such notice to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing, evidence that the Company Board has validly adopted resolutions to terminate such scheduled Company Plans on Section 5.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and taken all other actions necessary to terminate such Company Plans scheduled on Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, effective no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. (e) The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any employee of any Acquired Company with annual base compensation greater than two-hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($275,000) who delivers written notice to any Acquired Company at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time that he or she intends to resign or retire as a result of or in connection with the Transactions. (f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to continue any specific employee benefit plans, or to continue the employment of any specific Person for any period of time. The provisions of this Section 5.7 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to, on or following the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Plan following the Effective Time or (iii) confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, labor unions, directors, or independent contractors of any of the Acquired Companies, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Section 5.7. 


Section 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other of the receipt of (a) any written communication received from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions or (b) from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party sending or receiving such notice.   64

For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of the charter and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of any Acquired Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.9. (b) The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the Company obtaining, prepaid (or “tail”) directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification policies and fiduciary liability insurance policy or policies that provide coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing D&O Insurance”) that are no less favorable to the insureds (including as to terms, coverages, conditions, retentions and limits of liability) to the Company’s existing policy or, if substantially similar insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain such policies in full force and effect for the full term of six (6) years and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not pay an annual premium for the Continuing D&O Insurance in excess of three hundred fifty percent (350%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Company’s Current Premium”). If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such Continuing D&O Insurance at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect the then-current policies of directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification and fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company with respect to acts, omissions or events occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums for such directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification policies in excess of an aggregate   65

amount of three hundred fifty percent (350%) of the last annual premiums paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for its existing directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification policies and annual premiums for such fiduciary liability insurance in excess of an aggregate amount of three hundred fifty percent (350%) of the last annual premiums paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for its existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, but in each such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for each such respective three hundred fifty percent (350%) aggregate amount. (c) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets, then, and in each case, Parent and the Surviving Company shall ensure that such surviving corporation or entity or the transferees of such properties or assets assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of any of the Acquired Companies or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with any of the Acquired Companies, in each case in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or under applicable Law.

Section 5.11 Anti-Takeover Statutes.

(a) Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives and Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (including the market flex provisions set forth in any Fee Letter) as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply with the Commitment Letter until Merger I, Merger II and the other Transactions are consummated, (ii) timely negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the “Debt Financing Documents”) on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (and the market flex provisions set forth in any Fee Letter) so that the Debt Financing Documents are in effect as promptly as practicable but in any event no later than the Closing, (iii) satisfy or cause to be waived on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, their Representatives and their Affiliate set forth in the Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements and otherwise comply with their obligations thereunder; (iv) enforce Parent’s, Merger Sub I’s and Merger Sub II’s rights under the Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Documents, (v) comply with Parent’s, Merger Sub I’s and Merger Sub II’s covenants and other obligations under the Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Documents, (vii) fully pay (or cause to be fully paid) all commitment fees, ticking fees, other fees, costs, expenses and other amounts due and payable in connection with the Debt Financing; and (vi) upon the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, consummate the Debt Financing. (b) Parent shall not amend, modify or waive, or seek or agree to amend, modify or waive (in any case, whether by action or inaction), any term of the Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Documents without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement that is a breach of, or would result in termination of, the Commitment Letter.

(c) If the Debt Financing in an aggregate amount (together with cash and marketable securities on hand) at least equal to the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration to be deposited with the Exchange Agent and all other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article II, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter for any reason (such event, an “Original Financing Failure”), Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Original Financing Failure and Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable, alternative financing from alternative sources (including debt, equity or other financing) in an amount, when added with available cash and marketable securities of Parent and its Subsidiaries, sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses (the “Alternate Financing”), and to obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Financing (collectively, the “New Commitment Letter”) and related fee letters, which shall replace the existing Commitment Letter and any existing Fee Letter; provided that any such Alternate Financing shall not (i) obligate the Company prior to the Closing as a surety, guarantor or indemnitor or to extend credit to any person or (ii) impose any new or additional condition or otherwise expand any condition to draw and other terms that would reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof at the Closing. Parent shall promptly provide a true and complete copy of such New Commitment Letter and any related fee letter (as redacted to remove any fees, interest rates, “market flex” rights, and other economic terms, in each case that would not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of such alternative financing) in connection therewith to the Company. In the event a New Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Financing” shall mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the “Commitment Letter” shall be deemed to mean the New Commitment Letter and any fee letter provided in connection therewith, (iii) any reference in this Agreement to the “Fee Letter” shall be deemed to include any fee or other letter relating to the New Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (iv) any references to “Debt Financing Documents” shall be deemed to mean the definitive agreement with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the New Commitment Letter.   70

The parties further agree that no party to this Agreement shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.8, and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 8.8, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such Action is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may   93

not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II hereby consents to service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 8.2 and agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered mail (return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid) to the respective addresses set forth in Section 8.2 shall be effective service of process for any Action in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. (b) Each party hereto agrees that it will not bring any Action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source Related Party in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York County (and appellate courts thereof), and makes the agreements, waivers and consents set forth in Section 8.14 mutatis mutandis but with respect to the courts specified in this Section 8.8(b). 


Section 8.9 Non-Recourse. No Debt Financing Source Related Party shall have any liability for any claims or damages to the Company in connection with this Agreement, any Debt Financing or the Transactions or of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8.9 shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of any Debt Financing Source’s obligations to Parent under the Commitment Letter. 


Section 8.10 Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, as a whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; provided, however, that Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II may assign in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent so long as such assignment would not delay, impair or prevent consummation of the Merger, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 


Section 8.11 Remedies. Subject to Section 7.3, the parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including if any of the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions, including the parties’ obligations to consummate Merger I and Merger II, and the obligation of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to pay, and the right of the holders of Company Common Stock to receive, the Merger Consideration) and that money damages or other legal remedies, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or breach. Accordingly and subject to   94








________________


Section 7.3, each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, an injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity and no party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties hereby further waives any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 


Section 8.12 Currency. All references to “dollars” or “$” or “US$” in this Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all purposes in this Agreement. 


Section 8.13 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein, so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 


Section 8.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITH AND UPON THE ADVICE OF COMPETENT COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE RELATED PARTY). EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 8.14. 


Section 8.15 Counterparts; Execution. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.   95

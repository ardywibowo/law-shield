  ARTICLE II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK   Section 2.01         Conversion of Securities.   (a)          At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company or Sub:   (i)            Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each Share (including each Restricted Share) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive $70 in cash, without interest, subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax required to be withheld therefrom under applicable Law, in accordance with Section 2.05 (the “Merger Consideration”), and all of such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall cease to exist, and each certificate representing a Share (a “Certificate”) or a non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) that formerly represented any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter be cancelled and cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax required to be withheld therefrom under applicable Law, in accordance with Section 2.05.   (ii)           Cancellation or Conversion of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by the Company and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than, in each case, Shares held on behalf of a third party) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto. Any Shares that are beneficially held or owned of record by any Company Subsidiary shall be converted into a proportionate number of shares of the Surviving Corporation.   (iii)          Capital Stock of Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, all shares of common stock of Sub shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and all certificates representing such shares of common stock of Sub, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted, in each case in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.   (b)          Merger Consideration Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date and payment date within said period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.01(b) shall be construed to permit any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 (a)          Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. or another U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Restricted Shares) to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (such aggregate amount of cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Fund shall be for the benefit of the holders of Shares that are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. For purposes of determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent shall assume that no stockholder of the Company shall perfect any right to appraisal of such stockholder’s Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund is insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this ARTICLE II, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash such that the Exchange Fund becomes sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to this ARTICLE II; provided that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this ARTICLE II, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, an amount in cash equal to the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by this ARTICLE II. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Sub or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent or Sub, as Parent directs, shall be treated as the owner of the Exchange Fund for all Tax reporting purposes, and any interest or other income earned from the Exchange Fund shall be treated as the income of Sub or Parent, as applicable. The Paying Agent shall report such interest or other income as required by applicable Law. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the persons entitled to Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01 and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Section 2.02. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this Section 2.02, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.   




5   




  (b)          Procedures for Surrender.   (i)            Certificated Shares. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) to the Paying Agent; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of any Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, if applicable, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 2.01, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and Merger Consideration may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is properly endorsed or is otherwise in proper form for transfer, as reasonably determined by the Paying Agent and Parent, and the person requesting such payment either pays to the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.   (ii)           Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE II. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter) the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.   (iii)          No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) or in respect of any Book-Entry Share.   




6   




    (c)            Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.   (d)            Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of their Shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.02(b), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(e)            Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i); provided, however, that each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount and upon such terms and as may be reasonably required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, as indemnity against any claim that may be made Parent, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.

  Section 2.03           Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards.   (a)            Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding award of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with respect to Shares, including each award of performance-based restricted stock units granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (whether or not including a market-based vesting condition) (each, an “RSU Award”) shall be fully vested and (ii) each RSU Award shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such RSU Award and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of restricted stock units subject to such RSU Award, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the “RSU Payments”) (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.05). In the case of an RSU Award that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the number of RSUs deemed to have been earned shall be equal to the target number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award multiplied by the greater of (x) 100% and (y) the total stockholder return multiplier applicable to such RSU Award (up to a maximum of 125% of the target number of RSUs), calculated as of the Closing Date and using the Closing Date as the applicable measurement date, in accordance with the applicable terms of such RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, no such RSU Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of any such RSU Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.03(a) in exchange for such RSU Award in accordance with this Section 2.03(a). Subject to Section 2.03(e) and the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the consideration payable under this Section 2.03(a) to each former holder of an RSU Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll to such former holder as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the day that is ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.05.   (b)            Treatment of Restricted Shares. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each Restricted Share shall be fully vested and (ii) in accordance with Section 2.01(a)(i), each Restricted Share shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Restricted Share shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Restricted Share and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the “Restricted Share Payments”) (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.05). Following the Effective Time, no such Restricted Share that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of any such Restricted Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.01(a)(i) in exchange for such Restricted Share in accordance with Section 2.01(a)(i) and this Section 2.03(b). Subject to Section 2.03(e), the consideration payable under Section 2.01(a)(i) to each former holder of a Restricted Share that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be paid through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll to such former holder as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the day that is ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.05.   (c)            Termination of Company Stock Plan. As of the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.03, to terminate the Company Stock Plan and to ensure that no further rights with respect to Shares or any other awards shall be outstanding thereunder.   




8

 Section 4.05          Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Proceeding to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, either pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than those that would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding Order that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the Transactions.   Section 4.06         Capitalization and Operations of Sub. As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized share capital of Sub consists of 1,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent. Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, and it has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incidental to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger, the Financing and the other Transactions.   Section 4.07         Financing.   (a)          Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) the executed commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof (the “Equity Commitment Letters”), among Parent, Sub and the other parties thereto (the “Equity Financing Sources” and, together with the Debt Financing Sources, the “Financing Sources”), pursuant to which the Equity Financing Sources have committed, subject only to the terms thereof, to provide the cash and rollover equity financing described therein at the date and time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02 and to which the Company is an express third-party beneficiary (the “Equity Financing”), and (ii) an executed commitment letter (together with the term sheet and any other annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto), dated as of the date hereof (as may be amended, restated, amended and restated, replaced, substituted, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in accordance with Section 5.07 of this Agreement (including in connection with any Second Lien Giveaway or Replacement Commitment Facility), the “Debt Commitment Letter” and, together with the Equity Commitment Letters, the “Financing Commitment Letters”) from the Debt Financing Sources listed therein, pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources party thereto from time to time have committed, on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the Debt Financing. Parent has also delivered to the Company true and complete copies of any fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter (with only the fee amounts, pricing terms, pricing caps, flex provisions and certain other customary economic provisions (none of which individually or in the aggregate would reduce the amount of the Debt Financing or adversely affect the availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing or prevent or delay the Closing) redacted) (any such fee letter, as may be amended, restated, amended and restated, replaced, substituted, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in accordance with Section 5.07, a “Fee Letter”).   




39   




  (b)          Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the Financing Commitment Letters and that each of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and Section 6.03 is satisfied at the Closing, Parent and Sub will have sufficient available funds to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent or Sub for the consummation of the Transactions on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and to satisfy the obligations of Parent and Sub under this Agreement when due, including (i) the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.03, (ii) the payment of all costs and expenses of the Transactions (including any obligations of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries) which become due or payable by the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary in connection with, or as a result of, the Transactions and (iii) the repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required by the Debt Commitment Letter (collectively, the “Financing Purposes”).   (c)          As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded (or contemplated to be withdrawn, terminated or rescinded) or contemplated to be amended, supplemented or modified (other than, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter, any amendment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or any person with similar roles or titles who have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof (including in connection with any Second Lien Giveaway)) in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitment Letters, in the form delivered to the Company, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub and/or any Finance Affiliate (and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto) and is enforceable against Parent and Sub and/or any Finance Affiliate (and to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto) in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that would or would reasonably be expected to cause the Financing Commitment Letters to be ineffective. There are no side letters or other Contracts relating to the Financing Commitment Letters (except for (i) any Fee Letters or (ii) any other customary engagement letters or other agreements which do not impact the conditionality, availability or aggregate amount of the Financing). As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Sub under any term of the Financing Commitment Letters. Assuming that each of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and Section 6.03 is satisfied at the Closing, neither Parent nor Sub has reason to believe that it, any Finance Affiliate, any Equity Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Commitment Letters required to be satisfied by it. Parent and Sub have fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Financing Sources or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters.   (d)          Neither Parent nor Sub has, directly or indirectly, entered into any exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement, arrangement or binding understanding with any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing, or provider of surety or performance bonds (or similar bonds), that prohibits such provider from providing or seeking to provide any services or financing, including debt or equity financing, to any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making of any Competing Proposal) in connection with the Transactions.

  Section 4.08         Limited Guarantees. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Sub have caused the Guarantors to deliver the Limited Guarantees, dated as of the date hereof, to the Company. The Limited Guarantees are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. Each Limited Guarantee is a legal and valid and binding obligation of the applicable Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default or breach on the part of the applicable Guarantor under each Limited Guarantee.   Section 4.09         Solvency. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived and (b) (i) the most recent financial statements included in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its consolidated

Parent and Sub are not entering into the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any Finance Affiliate, Parent, Sub, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any affiliates thereof.   Section 4.10         Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder’s or other fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based on arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including Sub.   Section 4.11         Absence of Certain Arrangements. Other than this Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters and the Voting Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no Contracts or any commitments to enter into any Contract between Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee, the Specified Stockholder or any other stockholder of the Company, on the other hand, relating to the Transactions or the operations of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time. Other than the Voting Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any Contract or any commitments to enter into any Contract pursuant to which (a) any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration, (b) any third party has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, as of the date hereof, any capital (other than pursuant to the Financing Commitment Letters) to Parent or the Company to finance in whole or in part any of the Financing Purposes or otherwise in connection with the Transactions or (c) any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger or agrees to vote against any Competing Proposal.

  (b)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.03(b), if, at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the Company obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or the termination of this Agreement (and in no event after the Company obtains the Company Stockholder Approval), (i) the Company has received a bona fide written Competing Proposal from a person after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of Section 5.03(a) (other than an immaterial and unintentional breach), and (ii) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and the failure to take any of the following actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company’s Representatives may, subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 5.03 with respect to such Competing Proposal (other than immaterial or unintentional failures to comply), (A) furnish information, including with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to the person making such Competing Proposal and its Representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Competing Proposal and its Representatives in connection with such Competing Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not disclose any material non-public information regarding the Company or the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the foregoing without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person if such person is not already party to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Company.

  (d)           Except as set forth in Section 5.03(e) or Section 5.03(f), from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof will (i) adopt, authorize, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose or resolve to adopt, authorize, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable) any Competing Proposal or Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (ii) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend, qualify or change (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, modify, amend, qualify or change), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enter into, an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (v) fail to recommend against or otherwise indicate that the Company Board is unable to take a position with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer for any Equity Securities of the Company that constitutes a Competing Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (it being understood and agreed that, if and solely to the extent the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may, in connection with such recommendation against, state that it is continuing to negotiate with the person that made such Competing Proposal, and such statement shall not be considered a Change of Company Recommendation), (vi) following public announcement of a Competing Proposal, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within four (4) Business Days of receipt of a written request from Parent to do so if such Competing Proposal remains outstanding and not publicly rejected by the Company and is not the type of Competing Proposal described in clause (v) (provided that Parent may only request two (2) such reaffirmations with respect to any Competing Proposal, unless the terms of such Competing Proposal have been modified in any material respect (it being understood that any change in the consideration thereof shall be deemed such a modification in any material respect), in which case such Competing Proposal shall be deemed a new Competing Proposal), (vii) agree or announce an intention to do any of the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi), a “Change of Company Recommendation”) or (viii) cause or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.   (e)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may make a Change of Company Recommendation (and, if deemed advisable by the Company Board (or any committee thereof), terminate this Agreement, in accordance with Section 7.01(d), in order to cause the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal) if:   (i)            (A) a Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 5.03(a) (other than an immaterial and unintentional breach) is made to the Company by a third party and (B) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law;   (ii)          the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Company’s intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation (a “Notice of Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation”), which notice shall include (A) that the Company has received a written Competing Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) the material terms and conditions of the Competing Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the person, persons or group making such Competing Proposal) and (C) (1) an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (2) unredacted copies of all other agreements to be entered into between the Company and the person making such Competing Proposal in connection with such Competing Proposal and (3) any financing arrangements to finance the Competing Proposal if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determined such financing arrangements were material to its decision that the Competing Proposal was superior to the Merger (subject to redactions to the same extent as contemplated by Section 4.07) (it being agreed that neither the delivery of the Notice of Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation by the Company, in and of itself, nor the public announcement that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has provided such notice, if and solely to the extent the Company determines in good faith, in consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law, shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

  (iii)          prior to making such Change of Company Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.03(e) or terminating this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(d) in order to enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated, and directed the applicable Representatives of the Company to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during the three (3) Business Days (as may be extended by two (2) Business Days solely as required by clause (iv) below) following the date of such Notice of Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response thereto; and   (iv)          taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent pursuant to clause (iii) above and any other information provided by Parent in response to such Notice of Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Change of Company Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(d), as applicable, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law; provided that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Competing Proposal (whether or not in response to any changes proposed by Parent pursuant to clause (iii) above) shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal Change of Recommendation and an additional two (2) Business Day-notice period from the date of such notice during which the terms of clause (iii) above and this clause (iv) shall apply mutatis mutandis (other than the number of Business Days).   (f)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) may make a Change of Company Recommendation if:   (i)            an Intervening Event occurs;   (ii)          the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Company’s intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation (a “Notice of Intervening Event Change of Recommendation”), which notice shall (A) set forth in reasonable detail information describing the Intervening Event and (B) state expressly that, subject to clause (iii) and clause (iv) below, the Company Board has determined that failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation in connection with such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
















________________




applicable Law (it being agreed that neither the delivery of the Notice of Intervening Event Change of Recommendation by the Company nor any public announcement that the Company Board is considering making a Change of Company Recommendation shall, in and of itself, constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);   




52   




  (iii)           prior to making such Change of Company Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.03(f), if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated, and directed the applicable Representatives of the Company to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during the three (3) Business Days following the date of such Notice of Intervening Event Change of Recommendation (the “Intervening Event Change of Recommendation Notice Period”), with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response thereto; and   (iv)           following the end of the Intervening Event Change of Recommendation Notice Period, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent pursuant to clause (iii) above, that the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law.   (g)            Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (provided that such disclosure does not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation) or (ii) making any legally required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) of a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation).   Section 5.04           Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting.   (a)            As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file (and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to file within twenty (20) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. Subject to Section 5.03, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish all such reasonable information concerning it, Sub, the Guarantors and any of their respective affiliates that is necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in the connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing, including by providing responses to any comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC or its staff. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or any related documents (or in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto other than filings under the Exchange Act related to a Change of Company Recommendation made in accordance with this Agreement) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (i) provide Parent and its Representatives with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document (including drafts thereof) or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response) to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law and (ii) consider in good faith any comments on, or additions, deletions or changes to, such document or response provided by or on behalf of Parent or Sub. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments to the Proxy Statement from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all comments and correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions.   




53   




  (b)            If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or Parent, Sub, the Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable notify the other party. Following such notification, the Company shall file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information as promptly as reasonably practicable after Parent has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon in accordance with Section 5.04(a), and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall disseminate such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company.   (c)            Subject to Section 5.03, the Company shall, after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC (or the date the Proxy Statement may be mailed to stockholders pursuant to the applicable rules of the Exchange Act) for mailing to the Company’s stockholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) below, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, within ten (10) calendar days after such clearance, unless the parties agree in writing otherwise) (i) file the Proxy Statement in its definitive form with the SEC (which Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation), (ii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed after the date of such clearance and (iii) in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof to the extent made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the “Company Stockholders Meeting”) for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval; provided that the Company shall not be required to establish a record date or mail the Proxy Statement at dates or times inconsistent with the timeframe for holding the Company Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. In no event shall the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed (A) without Parent’s prior written consent in the event such record date would result in the Company Stockholders Meeting being within ten (10) Business Days of the Outside Date or (B) in all other circumstances, without prior consultation with Parent, in each case of clauses (A) and (B), unless required by applicable Law.

postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting, (i) to the extent necessary, in the judgment of the Company Board, to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company reasonably believes it is necessary to solicit additional proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting or (iii) to the extent the Company determines in good faith that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company’s obligations under applicable Law. Subject to Section 5.03, the Company Board shall recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt this Agreement (the “Company Recommendation”) and include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall, unless there has been a Change of Company Recommendation or this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to secure the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement. The Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to (A) provide Parent, on a timely basis, with the daily written voting reports the Company receives concerning proxy solicitation results for each of the ten (10) Business Days prior to the then-scheduled Company Stockholders Meeting and (B) give written notice to Parent one (1) Business Day prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and on the day of, but prior to, the Company Stockholders Meeting of the status of the Company Stockholder Approval.   (e)            Notwithstanding any Change of Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.03(f), the Company shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

  (g)            This Section 5.06 does not govern the obligations of Parent and Sub to obtain the Financing (which are instead governed by Section 5.07).   Section 5.07          Financing.   (a)            Parent and Sub shall, and, as applicable, shall cause their affiliates (including any Finance Affiliate) and representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts and do all things necessary or advisable to obtain the Financing at or prior to the Closing, on the terms and conditions (including any related “flex” provisions) described in the Financing Commitment Letters (for purposes of this Section 5.07, the Financing Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter shall include any Fee Letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (including any related flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (the “Definitive Debt Financing Agreements”), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions, including with respect to the payment of any fees, applicable to Parent, Sub or any Finance Affiliate obtaining the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements that are within their control, (iii) consummate and cause the Financing Sources to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing and (iv) enforce their rights under the Financing Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Prior to the Closing, Parent and Sub (and, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) shall not agree to any amendments, replacements or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other material provision under the Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing without the prior written consent of the Company, unless such amendment, modification, replacement or waiver does not and would not reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing thereunder (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof), (B) impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any condition, to the receipt of any portion of the Financing, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of any portion of the Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of the Financing) less likely to occur or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Sub or any Finance Affiliate to enforce its rights against any other party to any Financing Commitment Letter, the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the Transactions or the likelihood of the consummation of the Transaction; provided that (I) Parent and Sub (and, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) may amend the Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the financing to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or any person with similar roles or titles who have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof (including in connection with any Second Lien Giveaway) and (II) Parent and Sub (and, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) may enter into any Replacement Commitment Facility; provided, further, that any consent of the First Lien Lead Arrangements required in connection with any such Replacement Commitment Facility have been obtained and shall be promptly provided to the Company. Parent and Sub (and, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the Financing Commitment Letters (including any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) until the termination thereof in accordance with their respective terms. Any commitment letter and any associated fee letters governing any Replacement Commitment Facility are referred to, respectively, as a “Replacement Facility Commitment Letter” and a “Replacement Facility Fee Letter.” Neither Parent or Sub (or, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) shall release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements other than with respect to the Second Lien Term Facility solely in connection with any Second Lien Giveaway or Replacement Commitment Facility.

  (b)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates (which for purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect investor or potential investor in Parent, or any of the Guarantor’s, Parent’s or any such investor’s financing sources or potential financing sources or other representatives acting at the direction of or on behalf of Parent, the Guarantor or such investor) engage any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing, or provider of surety or performance bonds (or similar bonds) on an exclusive basis or otherwise on terms that prohibit or are designed to prevent such provider from providing or seeking to provide such services, financing or bonds to any person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions (including in connection with the making of any Competing Proposal); provided that Parent’s or any of its affiliates’ Debt Financing Sources may establish a “tree” system whereby separate groups or “trees” will be formed and dedicated to Parent in connection with the Transactions.   (c)            If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and Sub (and, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) shall use their reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, arrange and obtain financing in an amount sufficient to satisfy the Financing Purposes from the same or alternative sources, on terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions) that are not materially less favorable to Parent and Sub (and, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) in the aggregate than the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof (after giving effect to any “flex” provisions in the Fee Letter) and that do not add new (or expand upon or adversely modify the) conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters in effect on the date hereof or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent and Sub to timely consummate the Transactions. The new debt commitment letter and fee letter entered into in connection with such alternative financing are referred to, respectively, as a “New Debt Commitment Letter” and a “New Fee Letter.” In the event Parent or Sub (or, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) enter into any such New Debt Commitment Letter or Replacement Facility Commitment Letter or documentation with respect to a Second Lien Giveaway, (i) Parent and Sub shall promptly provide the Company with true, correct and complete copies thereof (provided that any fee letters may be redacted with respect to any fee amounts, pricing terms, pricing caps, flex provisions and certain other customary economic provisions (none of which individually or in the aggregate would reduce the amount of the Debt Financing or adversely affect the availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing or prevent or materially delay the Closing)), (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Financing” shall be deemed to include the debt financing contemplated by such New Debt Commitment Letter or Replacement Facility Commitment Letter, as applicable, (iii) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Commitment Letter” (and any definition incorporating the term “Debt Commitment Letter,” including the definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall be deemed to include such New Debt Commitment Letter and any New Fee Letter or such Replacement Facility Commitment Letter and any Replacement Facility Fee Letter, as applicable, and (iv) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Financing Sources” (and any definition incorporating the term “Debt Financing Sources,” including the definition of Financing Sources) shall be deemed to include any financial institutions and other lenders party to such New Debt Commitment Letter or such Replacement Facility Commitment Letter, as applicable, from time to time.   




61   




  (d)            Parent and Sub shall, upon reasonable request, keep the Company informed as promptly as practicable in reasonable detail of the status of their efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing and, upon reasonable request, provide the Company with drafts of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of any amendments to the Financing

Commitment Letters promptly upon their execution (including in connection with any Second Lien Giveaway or Replacement Commitment Facility) (provided that any Fee Letters may be redacted with respect to any fee amounts, pricing terms, pricing caps, flex provisions and certain other customary economic provisions (none of which individually or in the aggregate would reduce the amount of the Debt Financing or adversely affect the availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing or prevent or delay the Closing)) and (ii) give the Company prompt written notice (A) of any default or breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (or would reasonably be expected to) give rise to any default or breach) by any party under any of the Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing of which Parent or Sub becomes aware, (B) of any termination of any of the Financing Commitment Letters or any commitment provided thereunder, (C) of the receipt of any written notice from any person with respect to any (1) actual default, breach, termination or repudiation of any Financing Commitment Letter, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing or any provision of the Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, in each case, by any party thereto, or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, and (D) if for any reason Parent or Sub believe in good faith that they (or, if applicable, any Finance Affiliate) will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing. Parent and Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent.   




62   




(e)            Prior to the Closing, at Parent’s sole expense, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and instruct its and their respective Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Sub all customary cooperation or assistance as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to cooperate with any type of Debt Financing that is more burdensome to the Company than the first lien/second lien term loan credit facilities contemplated as the Debt Financing as of the date hereof (including any related “flex” provisions or any Second Lien Giveaway or Replacement Commitment Facility permitted pursuant to this Agreement). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such cooperation and assistance shall include using reasonable best efforts in (i) causing management of the Company, in each case, with appropriate seniority and expertise, to participate (including by teleconference or virtual meeting platforms) in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, sessions and road shows with prospective lenders or rating agencies and rating agency and due diligence sessions, (ii) providing reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda (including, to the extent necessary, an additional bank information memoranda that does not contain material non-public information), marketing materials, investor presentations (including road shows) and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, including executing customary authorization letters in connection with the distribution of such materials, and providing reasonable cooperation with the due diligence efforts of the Debt Financing Sources to the extent reasonable and customary (and, to the extent applicable, subject to the limitations contained in Section 5.05), (iii) (A) to the extent timely requested by Parent, obtaining documents, including the Payoff Letters and (if applicable) customary lien release documentation, evidencing the repayment of the Payoff Indebtedness and any other Indebtedness reasonably requested by Parent (and Parent provides the funds therefor) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the release of any related Liens and (B) promptly, and no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, providing all documentation and other information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable “know-your-customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (iv) furnishing Parent and Sub and the Debt Financing Sources with the Required Information, (v) reasonably assisting Parent with Parent’s preparation of pro forma financial statements and other financial information required to be included in any materials referred to in clause (ii) above related to the Debt Financing (it being understood that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not themselves be responsible for the preparation of such pro forma financial information), (vi) reasonably assisting Parent with Parent’s preparation of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, including cooperating to facilitate the pledging of, granting of security interests in and obtaining perfection of any Liens on, collateral in connection with the Debt Financing, and cause officers of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries who will be officers of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing, as applicable, to execute and deliver certificates and other documents as may reasonably be requested by Parent or the Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing (so long as such certificates and other documents will not be effective prior to the Closing), (vii) attempting to ensure that any syndication effort benefits from any existing lending and investment banking relationship of the Company, (viii) (A) reasonably cooperating with the amendment of or waivers pursuant to certain agreements governing existing Indebtedness and lease obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are intended to remain outstanding following the Closing, including the Synthetic Lease and (B) at Parent’s request, reasonably cooperating with respect to Parent’s real estate optimization strategies to be effective at or after the Closing, including, with respect to both Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property, by (so long as any such cooperation does not violate the terms of any lease or sub-lease with respect to any such Leased Real Property) (1) providing third parties designated by Parent with access to such properties, (2) assisting in obtaining environmental, engineering and title reports and surveys and (3) assisting with negotiating and entering into agreements with respect to such properties;

 (f)             Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing is a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02.   (g)             Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under Section 5.07(e) as it relates to the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b) unless the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained solely as a result of the Company’s or any of the Company Subsidiaries’ Intentional Breach of their obligations under Section 5.07(e).   Section 5.08           Public Announcements. The initial press release issued by Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a joint press release, the contents of which have received prior approval from both such parties, and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, including providing each other the opportunity to review and comment on such press release or any such public statement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, review and comment; provided that the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.08 shall not apply to any press release, public statement or other announcement issued or made, or proposed to be issued or made, by the Company (a) in connection with a Competing Proposal or any Change of Company Recommendation permitted in accordance with Section 5.03, (b) as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any applicable national securities exchange or (c) that is consistent in all material respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by a party hereto in accordance with this Section 5.08, in each case under this clause (c) to the extent such disclosure is still accurate. Nothing in this Section 5.08 shall limit the ability of the Company to make any internal announcements to its employees that are consistent in all material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions made in accordance with this Section 5.08. Further, nothing in this Section 5.08 shall, but subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, prevent any affiliate of Parent that is a private equity or similar investment fund, or any manager or general partner of any such fund, from reporting or disclosing with respect to fundraising, marketing, informational or reporting activities, on a confidential basis, to its partners, investors, potential investors or similar parties, general information regarding this Agreement and the Transactions, in each case subject to customary obligations of confidentiality with respect to non-public information such as transaction value or other specific economic terms. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any public filings providing notice to or seeking approval from any Governmental Entity made pursuant to Section 5.06 shall be governed by Section 5.06 and not this Section 5.08 and (ii) the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit any customary disclosure made by Parent, Sub and their respective affiliates to the Debt Financing Sources and rating agencies in connection with efforts or activities by Parent and Sub to obtain the Debt Financing or for a Rule 144A offering of debt securities (so long as such disclosure is in accordance with customary confidentiality practices for syndicated credit facilities or in connection with Rule 144A offerings).

  Section 5.09           Directors & Officers Indemnification and Insurance.   (a)              Indemnification. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organizational documents, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and each such person who performed services at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an “Indemnified Party” and collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary under benefit plans or performed services at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the “Indemnified Liabilities”), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and including any reasonable and documented expenses incurred in enforcing such person’s rights under this Section 5.09. In the event of any such Indemnified Liability (whether or not asserted before the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received, and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred (provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under applicable Law).   




65   




  (b)            Insurance. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) that (i) is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof than the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy existing on the date of this Agreement and (ii) expressly covers Parent and the Surviving Corporation as a successor in interest; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six (6)-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies, an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; provided, further, that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage reasonably available for a cost not exceeding such amount.   (c)            Successors. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, require such successors, assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent to assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.09.   (d)            Continuation. For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to ensure that the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the bylaws (or other similar documents) of the Surviving Corporation and the certificate of
















________________




incorporation and bylaws (or other similar documents) of each Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than those set forth in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary as of the date hereof. The contractual indemnification rights, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.   (e)            Benefit. The provisions of this Section 5.09 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each Indemnified Party’s heirs, executors or administrators, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified Party (including their successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.   




66   




  (f)            Non-Exclusivity. The provisions of this Section 5.09 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 5.09, is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.09 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.   Section 5.10      Takeover Statutes. The parties shall use reasonable efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or the other Transactions and (b) if any Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on such Transactions.   Section 5.11      Employee Matters.   (a)            For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, provide each individual who is an employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary (each, a “Company Employee”) who continues to remain employed with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (each, a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) a target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity that is no less favorable than the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity (excluding equity and equity-based compensation) provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits available to or provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) employee benefits (other than severance, incentive compensation, equity compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and retiree health and welfare benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (other than severance, incentive compensation, equity compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and retiree health and welfare benefits) provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the Continuation Period, Parent may, or may cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, in their sole discretion, provide some or all Continuing Employees with equity or equity-based compensation opportunities. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall be obligated to continue to employ any Continuing Employee for any specific period of time following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law.   




67   




  (b)            Without limiting the generality of Section 5.11(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume, honor and continue all of the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ employment, collective bargaining, severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in control or severance agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any Company Employee), in each case, in accordance with their terms (including terms relating to the amendment or termination thereof) as in effect prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event).   (c)            To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, benefit accrual and vesting (including, in order to calculate the amount of any paid time off and leave balance (including vacation and sick days), gratuities, severance and similar benefits, but not for purposes of defined benefit pension or retiree health and welfare benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) for the benefit of the Continuing Employees (the “Parent Plans”) following the Closing Date, Parent shall ensure that such plan, program or arrangement shall credit such Continuing Employees for service earned on and prior to the Closing Date with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their predecessors in addition to service earned with Parent or any of Parent’s affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) after the Closing Date; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.   (d)            Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to (i) waive any waiting periods and actively at work or evidence of insurability requirements and any limitations on eligibility, enrollment and benefits relating to any preexisting medical conditions of Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) maintain or establish, benefit plans that provide for health and welfare benefits and in which the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate as of the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of eligibility provisions and after taking into account Section 5.11(c) and (iii) recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and out of pocket limits under its Parent Plans providing health benefits, any deductible, coinsurance, copayments and out of pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employees and their respective dependents under Company Benefit Plans in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent such Continuing Employees participate in any such Parent Plans in such same calendar year.   (e)            Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, maintain or establish a defined contribution plan that is intended to be tax-qualified (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”) and in which the Company Employees primarily providing services in the United States shall be eligible to participate as of the Closing Date, subject to satisfaction of eligibility provisions and after taking into account Section 5.11(c).   (f)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or any other arrangement or create any rights or obligations except between the parties hereto, (ii) give any employee or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.11 or entitle any person not a party to this Agreement to assert any claim hereunder, or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan, except in accordance with the terms of such plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

The parties acknowledge and agree that neither of (i) any payment of the Parent Termination Fee nor (ii) any payment of the Company Termination Fee, is a penalty but is rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that is intended to compensate the Company, Parent or Sub, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, that in the case of an Intentional Breach by the Company of this Agreement prior to termination of this Agreement, Parent and Sub shall be entitled to seek Damages in an amount up to the Damages Cap for Damages suffered as a result of such Intentional Breach.

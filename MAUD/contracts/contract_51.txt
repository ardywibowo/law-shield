At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:   (a)            Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall represent one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time.   (b)            Capital Stock of the Company.   (i)            Subject to the other provisions of this Article III, each share of Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares and shares of Company Common Stock covered by Section 3.2) (the “Eligible Shares”) shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive 1.1711 (the “Exchange Ratio”) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the “Share Consideration”). In addition, in the event that Parent pays one or more Parent Quarterly Dividend(s) as contemplated by Section 6.2(b)(i), then at the Effective Time each Eligible Share shall receive the Additional Share Consideration, such that the Eligible Shares receive substantially equivalent aggregate value as compared to the aggregate amount of any Parent Quarterly Dividend(s). The term Merger Consideration shall mean the Share Consideration, together with (if applicable) the Additional Share Consideration.   (ii)            All such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist.

(iii)            All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, “Excluded Shares”) shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   




7    




  (c)            Impact of Stock Splits, Etc.

Nothing in this Section 3.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement.   Section 3.2      Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards.   (a)            Each outstanding award of restricted stock units (including Company DSU Awards and restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting conditions) issued pursuant to the Company’s 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the “Company Equity Plan”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company RSU Award ”) and that by its terms does not settle by reason of the occurrence of the Closing shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and without any action by the Parties, be assumed by Parent and converted into a number of restricted stock units with respect to shares (rounded to the nearest number of whole shares) of Parent Common Stock (such restricted stock unit, a “Converted RSU”) equal to the product of the number of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, effective as of the Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time, each Converted RSU shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting and forfeiture) that were applicable to the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that any Company RSU Award subject to performance-based vesting conditions shall continue to be measured pursuant to the same terms and conditions of the underlying Company RSU Award in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided further that Converted RSU Awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions held by those Company Employees listed on Schedule 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a “Company Executive”) shall each provide that, in the event the Company Executive’s employment is terminated for death, disability, by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent for any reason other than for Cause (as defined in the applicable award agreement), or by the Company Executive for Good Reason (as defined in the applicable award agreement), in each case, on or within 12 months following the Closing Date, the portion of such Company Executive’s Converted RSU Award subject to performance-based vesting conditions shall, effective as of such Company Executive’s termination date, immediately vest in full based on deemed achievement of any applicable performance goals at the maximum level of performance; provided, further, that, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company DSU Award held by a member of the Company Board who is not a Company Designee shall immediately vest in full.   (b)            Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Equity Plan) shall pass any necessary resolutions to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2. The Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration contemplated within this Section 3.2 in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Company Equity Plan.

  Section 3.3      Payment for Securities; Exchange.   (a)            Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with a commercial bank, trust company or transfer agent that is mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Article III. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance with this Article III through the Exchange Agent, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to Section 3.1. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any Post-Effective Time Dividends and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.3(h). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 3.3(a), Section 3.3(g) and Section 3.3(h), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.3(h) and any Post-Effective Time Dividends) shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. To the extent, for any reason, the amount in the Exchange Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III, Parent shall promptly replace, restore or supplement the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this Article III. Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation.   (b)            Payment Procedures.   (i)            Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Eligible Shares (“Certificates”), a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i). Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to

  (ii)            Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Eligible Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) not held through the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), (A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a statement reflecting the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (C) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.3(h) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(g).   (iii)            DTC Book-Entry Shares. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC’s customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, the cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), if any), and any unpaid non- stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this Article III.   (iv)            No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Article III.   (v)            With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), and Post-Effective Time Dividends is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), and Post-Effective Time Dividends to a Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), and Post-Effective Time Dividends shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company as of the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b)(v), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), and any Post-Effective Time Dividends payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock.

  (c)            Termination of Rights . All Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares fo Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h) and Post-Effective Time Dividends, paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), and Post-Effective Time Dividends payable in respect of the Eligible Shares previously represented by such Certificates.   (d)            Termination of Exchange Fund . Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), and Post- Effective Time Dividends, in each case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts.   (e)            No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (f)            Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3(h), and Post-Effective Time Dividends payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

  (g)            Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time (“Post-Effective Time Dividends”) shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3. Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable

in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the Post-Effective Time Dividends theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the Post-Effective Time Dividends with a record date prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to Post-Effective Time Dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.   (h)            No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book- Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.   (i)            Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent, each of their respective Affiliates and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent deduction and withholding is required in respect of the delivery of any Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, a portion of the Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable hereunder may be withheld); provided, however, the relevant withholding party shall use reasonable best efforts to provide prior written notice to the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after it determines withholding is required under this Section 3.3(i). Parent will consult with the Company in good faith to determine whether such deduction and withholding is required and will reasonably cooperate with the Company to minimize the amount of any applicable withholding or deduction. To the extent that such amounts are so properly deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect to which such amounts would have been paid absent such deduction or withholding, and if withholding is taken in Parent Common Stock, the relevant withholding agent shall be treated as having sold such Parent Common Stock on behalf of such Person for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value thereof at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the relevant Taxing Authority.

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its assets or properties, makes such qualification or license necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify, license or be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Organizational Documents and the Organizational Documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, each as amended prior to the execution of this Agreement, and each as made available to Parent is in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of such Organizational Documents.

Once the Company has established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder. Without the prior written consent of Parent or as required by applicable Law, (i) the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than a nonbinding advisory proposal regarding compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger and matters of procedure) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company shall not submit any other proposal to such stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise (including any proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions) and (ii) the Company shall not call any meeting of the stockholders of the Company other than the Company Stockholders Meeting.

any of the Parent’s stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Parent Stockholder Approval from being obtained. Once Parent has established a record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder.

  (c)            The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to set the record dates for and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, on the same day and at approximately the same time.   (d)            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Article VIII, each of the Company and Parent agrees that its obligations to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not be affected by the making of a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of Recommendation, as applicable, and its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not be affected by the commencement, announcement, disclosure, or communication to the Company or Parent, as applicable, of any Company Competing Proposal or Parent Competing Proposal or other proposal (including, with respect to the Company, a Company Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or disclosure of any Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event.   (e)            Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall duly approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub in accordance with applicable Law and the Organizational Documents of Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent so approving and adopting this Agreement.   Section 6.7     Access to Information.   (a)            Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this Section 6.7, the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement, or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives, during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 8.1, reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records, Contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent and its Representatives such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries’ business, properties, Contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of Parent. Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing:   




76    




  (i)            No Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information, as applicable, to the other Party or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such information, as applicable, is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing Contract or agreement (provided, however, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through the use of commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required Consent or waiver of any third party required to provide such information and (B) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the Parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege);   (ii)           No Party shall have access to personnel records of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other personnel information that in the other Party’s good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability;   (iii)          Each Party shall not be permitted to conduct any invasive or intrusive sampling or analysis (commonly known as a “Phase II”) of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of the other Party or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the other Party (which may be granted or withheld in such other Party’s sole discretion); and   (iv)          No investigation or information provided pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein and no Party shall, and each Party shall cause their respective Representatives to not, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.7 for any purpose unrelated to the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the Transactions.   (b)            The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June 12, 2020 between Parent and the Company, as amended by the First Amendment to Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 16, 2021 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder. All information provided to any Party or its Representative pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be “Evaluation Material” as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, each Party shall continue to provide access to the other Party and its Representatives to the electronic data room relating to the Transactions maintained by or on behalf of it to which the other Party and its Representatives were provided access prior to the date of this Agreement.

 (a)            Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, including under any applicable Laws, to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including (i) the prompt preparation and filing of all forms, notifications, declarations, registrations, notices and other submissions required to be filed with any Governmental Entity prior to the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Transactions, (iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any Consent, clearance, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary material required or requested under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws) required to be obtained or made by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with or that are necessary to consummate the Transactions, (iv) taking reasonable actions to defend any Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be required to pay any consideration to any third parties or give anything of value to obtain any such Person’s authorization, approval, Consent or waiver to effectuate the Transactions. In the event that any litigation, administrative or judicial action or other proceeding is commenced challenging the Transactions, the Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions. Additionally, Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Transactions and shall not take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any Consent, clearance, authorization, order or approval from any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to Closing. To the extent that transfers of any permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.   




78    




  (b)            Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required Consents, clearances, authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.8. In that regard, each Party shall promptly consult with the other Party to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Party (or its counsel) copies of), all filings, notices or other submissions made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each Party shall promptly inform the other Party, and if in writing, furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other Party orally of) any material communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions, and permit the other Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed written or oral communication with any such Governmental Entity. If either Party or any Representative of such Party receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such Party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such request. Neither Parent nor the Company shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Entity where material issues would likely be discussed in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Each Party shall furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, and furnish the other Party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings, notices or other submissions of information or documents to any such Governmental Entity; provided, however, that materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.8 may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, Parent, the Transaction or other confidential or competitively sensitive information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual requirements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege waiver risks.   (c)            The Company and Parent shall file, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the notification and report forms required under the HSR Act. In the event that the Parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a “Second Request”), the Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process; provided, however, the final determination as to the appropriate course of action shall be made by Parent.   Section 6.9     Employee Matters.   (a)            Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company shall (and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to) make reasonably available to Parent the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries so that Parent may interview such employees and evaluate their roles and responsibilities with the Company and its Subsidiaries, including with respect to potential promotions, transfers, or job eliminations following the Closing.   (b)            The Parties agree that for a period of 12 months following the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), and subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.9(b), Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary of Parent, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, to provide each employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) (collectively, “Continuing Employees”) compensation and employee benefits (including, for the avoidance of doubt, severance payments and benefits) in a manner that neither favors nor disfavors (other than in an immaterial manner) such individual, in whole or in part, on the basis of whether such individual was an employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand, immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that this Section 6.9(b) shall be deemed satisfied in the event Parent should for the Continuation Period, either (i) provide compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits to which the Continuing Employees were entitled immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide compensation and employee benefits to the Continuing Employees employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) at substantially the same level as applies to similarly-situated individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) provide compensation and employee benefits to the Continuing Employees employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time at substantially the same level as applies to similarly-situated individuals employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.9(b) shall prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from converting the method of payment for any Continuing Employee from salaried to an hourly basis.   




79    




  (c)            Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Board and the Company Board shall take such action as is necessary to provide that the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement are deemed to constitute a “Change in Control” or “Change of Control” for purposes of each Company Benefit Plan or Parent

Benefit Plan listed on Schedule 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter and Schedule 6.9(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.   (d)           Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to honor their respective obligations under all employment, severance, change in control, retention and other agreements, if any, between the Company (or a Subsidiary thereof) and a Company Employee, including, but not limited to, those Company Benefit Plans set forth on Schedule 6.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, it being understood that the foregoing shall not be construed to limit any amendments or terminations otherwise permitted by the terms of the applicable agreements.   (e)            From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, the Parties shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take commercially reasonable efforts to credit the Company Employees for purposes of vesting, eligibility, severance and benefit accrual under the Parent Benefit Plans and the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, (other than for any purposes with respect to any “defined benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, retiree medical benefits or disability benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation for the same period of service) in which the Company Employees participate, for such Company Employees’ service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into account under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that such credit does not result in duplicate benefits.   (f)            The Parties shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health coverage of any Company Employees or any of their covered, eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable Parent Benefit Plan to the extent such Company Employee or covered, eligible dependents are covered under an analogous Company Benefit Plan, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing Date, and such conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such Parent Benefit Plan and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which payment has been made, in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan provider and only to the extent such deductibles or limits for medical expenses were satisfied or did not apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

    (g)            Prior to the Closing Date, if requested by Parent in writing at least three (3) days before the Closing, the Company shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to take all necessary and appropriate actions to cause (i) each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the “Company 401(k) Plan”) to be terminated and (ii) all participants to cease participating under the Company 401(k) Plan, in each case, effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that such actions may be contingent upon Closing. The Company shall provide Parent with an advance copy of all documentation necessary to effect this Section 6.9(g) and a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon prior to the adoption or execution thereof. In the event the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated as set forth in the preceding sentence, as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall take any and all reasonable actions as may be reasonably required, including amendments to a defined contribution retirement plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code designated by Parent (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”) to (A) cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept any “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in the form of cash in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, including any outstanding loans and (B) cause each Company Employee to become a participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date (subject to any applicable eligibility requirements, but giving effect to the service crediting provisions of Section 6.9(e)).   (h)            Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an establishment or termination of, or an amendment to, or be construed as establishing, terminating or amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 6.9 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any third party beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.9) under or by reason of any provision of this Section 6.9. Nothing in this Section 6.9 is intended to (i) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from terminating the employment or service of any Person, including a Company Employee, at any time and for any reason, (ii) provide any Person any right to employment or service or continued employment or service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or any particular term or condition of employment or service, or (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from terminating, revising or amending any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(a)            Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, in the same manner as provided by Parent or the Company, as applicable, immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Parent Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan, in each case, when acting in such capacity (the “Indemnified Persons”) against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Parent Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the request of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise, as applicable, or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, but not after, the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, but not after, the Effective Time (“Indemnified Liabilities”), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred in connection therewith, including but not limited to expenses for the retention of the Company’s regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the Company’s regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel

for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.10 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such Party’s position with respect to such claims). With respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.10, such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by Parent or Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed material services for Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last three (3) years.

  (b)            Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that, until the six (6) year anniversary date of the Effective Time, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would) adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation agreements between Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries and any of their respective directors or officers existing and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 9.11      Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this Section 9.11, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at Law or in equity. Each Party accordingly agrees (a) the non-breaching Party will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without proof of actual damages; and (b) the alleged breaching Party will not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement and will not plead in defense thereto that there are adequate remedies at Law, all in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.11. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. If prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings an action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by such other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

  Section 9.12      Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law would require the further approval by such stockholders without first obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.   Section 9.13      Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent may, to the extent legally allowed:   (a)            extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Party hereunder;   (b)            waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or   (c)            waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other Party contained herein.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No waiver by any of the Parties of any default, misrepresentation or breach of representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

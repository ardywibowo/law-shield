Section 1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. 


(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any further action on the part of Pi, Merger Sub Inc., Lambda or any holder of capital stock thereof: (i) each share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of Lambda (the “Lambda Common Stock”) held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Pi, Merger Sub Inc., or Lambda (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”), shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and (ii) subject to Section 1.6(b) and Section 1.6(c), each share of Lambda Common Stock issued and outstanding (other than Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive from Pi 0.51 fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Pi (the “Pi Common Stock”). 


The number of shares of Pi Common Stock into which each share of Lambda Common Stock shall be converted, as specified in Section 1.6(a)(ii) (as such number may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.6(b)), is referred to as the “Exchange Ratio.” The aggregate number of shares of Pi Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(ii), together with any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Pi Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.6(c), is referred to as the “Merger Consideration.” (b) Without limiting the parties’ respective obligations under Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, including Section 4.1(b)(i) and Section 4.2(b)(i), if, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Lambda Common Stock or Pi Common Stock shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, then the Exchange Ratio and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the Exchange Ratio or any such other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement. (c) No fractional shares of Pi Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the First Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a holder of Pi Common Stock. Any holder of Lambda Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Pi Common Stock pursuant to the First Merger (after taking into account all shares of Lambda Common Stock held immediately prior to the Effective Time by such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holder’s Lambda Stock Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Common Shares, be paid in cash the dollar amount specified by Section 1.8(f). (d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of Pi, Merger Sub Inc., Lambda or any holder of capital stock thereof, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub Inc. issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of   5








________________


common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub Inc. shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. (e) At the Second Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of Pi, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub LLC or the holders of any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of Pi, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub LLC, each share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation issued pursuant to the First Merger and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, and Pi shall continue as the sole member of the Surviving Company. 


Section 1.7 Closing of Lambda’s Transfer Books. (a) At the Effective Time: (i) all shares of Lambda Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and (A) each certificate (a “Lambda Stock Certificate”) formerly representing any share of Lambda Common Stock (other than an Excluded Share) and (B) each Book-Entry Common Share formerly representing any share of Lambda Common Stock (other than an Excluded Share) shall represent only the right to receive shares of Pi Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Pi Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 1.6 and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(c), and all holders of Lambda Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Common Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of Lambda; and (ii) the stock transfer books of Lambda shall be closed with respect to all shares of Lambda Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Lambda Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid Lambda Stock Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Pi, such Lambda Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in this Article I. 


Section 1.8 Exchange Fund; Exchange of Certificates. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Pi and Lambda shall mutually select a bank or trust company, which may be the transfer agent for the Pi Common Stock, to act as exchange agent in the First Merger (the “Exchange Agent”), and, not later than the Effective Time, Pi shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, which will provide that, at or prior to the Effective Time, Pi shall deposit with the Exchange Agent all of the shares of Pi Common Stock required to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(ii) and Section 1.8(f). The shares of Pi Common Stock so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with (i) any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares and (ii) proceeds received from the sale of the Pi Excess Shares pursuant to Section 1.8(f), are referred to collectively as the “Exchange Fund.”   6








________________


(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Pi shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the record holders of Lambda Stock Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Pi and Lambda may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Lambda Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Lambda Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Lambda Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Lambda Stock Certificates in exchange for Pi Common Stock, as provided in Section 1.6, and any cash in lieu of a fractional share which the shares of Lambda Common Stock represented by such Lambda Stock Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 1.8(c). Upon surrender of a Lambda Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Pi, (A) the holder of such Lambda Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in book- entry form the number of whole shares of Pi Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.6 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Pi Common Stock) as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 1.8(c), and (B) the Lambda Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be immediately canceled. (c) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to the Pi Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Lambda Stock Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Lambda Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article I. After the surrender of a Lambda Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article I, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Pi Common Stock which the shares of Lambda Common Stock represented by such Lambda Stock Certificate have been converted into the right to receive. (d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each Lambda Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of Pi Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Pi Common Stock) as contemplated by this Article I and any distribution or dividend with respect to Pi Common Stock the record date for which is after the Effective Time. (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Lambda Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Lambda, shares in book-entry form representing the proper number of shares of Pi Common Stock may be issued to a Person, other than the Person in whose name such Lambda Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Lambda Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of Pi Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such Lambda Stock Certificate or, establish to the satisfaction of Pi, that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. If any Lambda Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Pi may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any shares in book- entry form representing Pi Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Lambda Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Pi may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Pi or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Lambda Stock Certificate.   7

(f) (i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall (A) determine the number of whole shares of Pi Common Stock and the number of fractional shares of Pi Common Stock that each holder of Lambda Common Stock is entitled to receive in connection with the consummation of the First Merger and (B) aggregate all such fractional shares of Pi Common Stock that would, except as provided in Section 1.6(c), be issued to the holders of Lambda Common Stock, rounding up to the nearest whole number (the “Pi Excess Shares”), and the Exchange Agent shall, on behalf of former stockholders of Lambda, sell the Pi Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), all in the manner provided in Section 1.8(f)(ii). (ii) The sale of the Pi Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq through one or more member firms of Nasdaq and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the Pi Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agent’s sole judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the former holders of Lambda Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders (the “Lambda Common Stock Trust”). Pi shall pay all commissions and other out-of-pocket transaction costs (other than any transfer or similar Taxes imposed on a holder of Lambda Common Stock), including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of the Pi Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Lambda Common Stock Trust to which each former holder of Lambda Common Stock is entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds composing the Lambda Common Stock Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such former holder of Lambda Common Stock is entitled (after taking into account all shares of Lambda Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all former holders of Lambda Common Stock are entitled. (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to former holders of Lambda Common Stock with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.8. (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to stockholders of Lambda as of the date six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Pi upon demand, and any holders of Lambda Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Lambda Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 1.8 and any holders of Book-Entry Common Shares who have not theretofore cashed any   8

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES 


Section 5.1 Investigation. (a) Each of Lambda and Pi shall afford to the other party and its Affiliates and to its and their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) of such other party reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to its and its Subsidiaries’ personnel and properties (to the extent and only to the extent Lambda or Pi, as applicable, or its respective Subsidiaries has to right to permit access to such properties), Contracts, commitments, books and records and any report, schedule or other documents filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws and with such additional financing, operating and other data and information regarding Lambda and the Lambda Subsidiaries, as Pi may reasonably request in connection with activities related to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the “Activities”), or regarding Pi and the Pi Subsidiaries, as Lambda may reasonably request in connection with the Activities, as the case may be, provided, however, that in no event shall access be provided to conduct any invasive sampling, monitoring or other investigations, including any Phase II assessments or investigations. Until the date that is 10 Business Days prior to the Termination Date, Pi and its Representatives shall be permitted to conduct non-invasive environmental assessments, including any Phase I environmental site assessments in accordance with ASTM Standard E1527-13. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Lambda nor Pi nor their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any applicable Law, Contract or obligation of confidentiality to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (provided that Pi or Lambda, as the case may be, has used its reasonable best efforts to find an alternative way to provide the access or information contemplated by this Section 5.1), cause a risk of a loss of privilege to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall not have access to personnel records of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information that in the other Party’s good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of material liability. Each Party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. (b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be subject to the terms of that certain Confidentiality Agreement, effective as of March 10, 2021, between Lambda and Pi (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).   62

Section 5.2 Support Agreements; Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement for Stockholder Approval. (a) (i) Lambda will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Lambda Supporting Stockholders to execute and deliver to Pi their respective Lambda Support Agreements and (ii) Pi will use reasonable best efforts to cause Juniper to execute and deliver to Lambda the Pi Support Agreement, in each case, not later than the Support Agreement Deadline. In the event Lambda Supporting Stockholders holding not less than a majority of the shares of Lambda Common Stock outstanding as of the date of this Agreement (the “Requisite Lambda Support Agreements”) fail to deliver their respective Lambda Support Agreements by the Support Agreement Deadline, a “Lambda Support Agreement Failure” shall be deemed to have occurred. (b) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Pi and Lambda shall jointly prepare and each shall file with the SEC a joint proxy statement/consent solicitation statement in preliminary form, related to the solicitation of proxies from Pi Stockholders and the solicitation of written consents from Lambda Stockholders, which shall contain each of the Pi Recommendation and the Lambda Recommendation (unless, in either case, a Pi Adverse Recommendation Change or an Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, occurs) and comply with applicable Laws (the “Joint Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement”), and Pi shall prepare and file with the SEC (a) a Registration Statement on Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement will be included, and (b) a prospectus relating to the Pi Common Stock to be offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger; provided, however, that in the event of a Lambda Stockholder Meeting Election, in lieu of a consent solicitation statement, Lambda shall prepare and file a proxy statement related to the solicitation of proxies from Lambda Stockholders. Pi and Lambda shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after its filing. Each of Pi and Lambda shall use its reasonable best efforts to mail the Joint Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Pi shall also use its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws and other applicable Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Pi Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, and each party shall furnish all information concerning Lambda, Pi and the holders of capital stock of Lambda and Pi, as applicable, as may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement will be made by Pi, or with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement will be made by Lambda, Pi or any of their Subsidiaries, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Pi will advise Lambda, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Pi Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC   63

for additional information. Each of Pi and Lambda shall advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Lambda or Pi, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Lambda or Pi which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC, after the other party has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to either the Pi Stockholders or the Lambda Stockholders, as applicable. 


Section 5.3 Lambda Consent Solicitation; Lambda Stockholder Meeting; Pi Stockholder Meeting. (a) Unless there is a Lambda Stockholder Meeting Election, Lambda shall provide a form of stockholder written consent to the Lambda Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective. Lambda shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Lambda Supporting Stockholders to duly execute and deliver stockholder written consents substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the “Lambda Stockholder Written Consent” and the Lambda Stockholder Written Consents executed by Lambda Supporting Stockholders holding not less than a majority of the shares of Lambda Common Stock, the “Requisite Lambda Stockholder Written Consents”) in respect of the Lambda Common Stock beneficially owned by each such Lambda Supporting Stockholder in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following the time at which the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act (the “Lambda Written Consent Deadline”). As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of the Lambda Stockholder Written Consents by the Lambda Supporting Stockholders to Pi, Lambda shall deliver to Pi a copy of each such Lambda Stockholder Written Consent. (b) Without prejudice to Pi’s rights or ability to seek specific performance under the Lambda Support Agreements of the Lambda Supporting Stockholders’ obligations to execute and deliver the Lambda Stockholder Written Consent, (x) in the event of a Lambda Support Agreement Failure or (y) in the event the Requisite Lambda Stockholder Written Consents are not obtained by the Lambda Written Consent Deadline, upon the written request of Pi within five Business Days of the event described in clause (x) or (y), as applicable, Lambda shall, in lieu of taking the actions contemplated by Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of this Agreement in order to obtain the Requisite Lambda Stockholder Written Consents, instead take the actions contemplated by Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of this Agreement in order to obtain the Lambda Stockholder Approval at a meeting of Lambda Stockholders (a “Lambda Stockholder Meeting Election”). In the event of a Lambda Stockholder Meeting Election, Lambda shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Lambda Organizational Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Lambda Stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable after the   64

Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, to vote upon the Lambda Proposals (the “Lambda Stockholders’ Meeting”). Subject to Section 5.4(b) and (c), Lambda will, through the Lambda Board, recommend that the Lambda Stockholders approve the Lambda Proposals and will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the Lambda Stockholders proxies in favor of the Lambda Proposals and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Lambda Stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or applicable Laws to obtain such approvals. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lambda agrees that (i) its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.3(c) shall not be affected by (A) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Lambda of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda or (B) any Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) no Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda shall be presented to the Lambda Stockholders for approval at the Lambda Stockholders’ Meeting or any other meeting of the Lambda Stockholders; provided that, nothing set forth in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit Lambda or the Lambda Board from disclosing to the Lambda Stockholders the existence of, or any terms or provisions of, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda or any of the modifications thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Lambda (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Lambda Stockholders’ Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Lambda Stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Lambda Stockholders’ Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Lambda Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Lambda Stockholders’ Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Lambda Stockholders’ Meeting if, as of the time for which the Lambda Stockholders’ Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Lambda Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Lambda Stockholders Approval; provided, however, that the Lambda Stockholders’ Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to the Termination Date. (c) Pi shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Pi Organizational Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Pi Stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, to vote upon the Pi Proposal (the “Pi Stockholders’ Meeting”). Subject to Section 5.4(e) and (f), Pi will, through the Pi Board, recommend that the Pi Stockholders approve the Pi Proposal and will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the Pi Stockholders proxies in favor of the Pi Proposal and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Pi Stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or applicable Laws to obtain such approvals. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Pi agrees that (i) its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.3(c) shall not be affected by (A) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Pi of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi or (B) any Pi Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) no Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi shall be presented to the Pi Stockholders for approval at the Pi Stockholders’ Meeting or any other meeting of the Pi Stockholders; provided that, nothing set forth in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit Pi or the Pi Board from disclosing to the Pi Stockholders the existence of, or any terms or provisions of, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi or any of the modifications thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Pi (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Pi Stockholders’ Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is   65

Section 5.4 Non-Solicitation. (a) Lambda agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, neither it nor any of the Lambda Subsidiaries shall, and Lambda shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of the Lambda Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts to, cause their respective Representatives not to (i) directly or indirectly initiate or solicit, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information relating to Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries) any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda, (ii) other than clarifying terms of the Acquisition Proposal in accordance with the penultimate sentence of this Section 5.4(a), participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating to Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda or to any Person in contemplation of making an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda or (iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda or enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to this Section 5.4) or (B) requiring, intending to cause, or which could reasonably be expected to cause Lambda to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Integrated Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (each, a “Lambda Acquisition Agreement”). Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the Lambda Subsidiaries or by any Representatives of Lambda who are directors or executive officers of Lambda, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Lambda or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Lambda. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the earlier of (1) delivery of the Requisite Lambda Support Agreements or (2) in the event of a Lambda Stockholder Meeting Election by Pi, the time the Lambda Stockholder Approval is obtained, Lambda and the Lambda Board may take any actions described in clause (ii) in the first sentence of this Section 5.4(a) with respect to a third party if (w) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of (1) delivery of the Requisite Lambda Support Agreements or (2) in the event of a Lambda Stockholder Meeting Election by Pi, the time the Lambda Stockholder Approval is obtained, Lambda receives a written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda from such third party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives), (x) Lambda provides Pi the notice   66

required by Section 5.4(g) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (y) the Lambda Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Lambda’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal with respect to Lambda, and (z) the Lambda Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Lambda’s outside legal counsel) that the failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to disclose such information or data to such third party would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided that Lambda shall not deliver any information to such third party without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such third party. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Section 5.4(a) and subject to compliance with Lambda’s obligations contained in Section 5.4(g), if Lambda receives, following the date hereof and prior to the earlier of (1) delivery of the Requisite Lambda Support Agreements or (2) in the event of a Lambda Stockholder Meeting Election by Pi, the time the Lambda Stockholder Approval is obtained, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a knowing and intentional breach of this Section 5.4, Lambda and its Representatives may contact the Person or any of such Person’s Representatives who has made such Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such Acquisition Proposal so that Lambda may inform itself about such Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit Lambda or the Lambda Board from taking and disclosing to the Lambda Stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law. (b) Neither (i) the Lambda Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (A) withhold or withdraw (or amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Pi, Merger Sub Inc. or Merger Sub LLC), or publicly propose or announce any intention to withhold or withdraw (or amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Pi, Merger Sub Inc. or Merger Sub LLC), the Lambda Recommendation or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lambda (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a “Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change”) nor (ii) shall Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries execute or enter into a Lambda Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Lambda Stockholder Approval, and subject to Lambda’s compliance in all material respects at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.4 and Section 5.3, in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to Lambda that was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, the Lambda Board may make a Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however, that Lambda shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to Lambda (x) until three (3) Business Days after Lambda provides written notice to Pi (a “Lambda Notice”) advising Pi that the Lambda Board or a committee thereof has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal, (y) if during such three (3) Business Day period, Pi proposes any alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this Agreement), unless the Lambda Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Lambda’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all financial, legal, and regulatory terms and conditions of such alternative transaction proposal, including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any risks of non-consummation of such alternative transaction proposal) that such alternative   67

(c) Notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 5.4(b), at any time prior to obtaining the Lambda Stockholder Approval, and subject to Lambda’s compliance in all material respects at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.4 and Section 5.3, in response to a Lambda Intervening Event, the Lambda Board may make a Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (A) of the definition thereof if the Lambda Board (i) determines in good faith, after consultation with Lambda’s outside legal counsel and any other advisor it chooses to consult, that the failure to make such Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, (ii) determines in good faith that the reasons for making such Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change are independent of any Acquisition Proposal (whether pending, potential or otherwise) with respect to Lambda and (iii) provides written notice to Pi (a “Lambda Notice of Change”) advising Pi that the Lambda Board is contemplating making a Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the material facts and information constituting the basis for such contemplated determination; provided, however, that (x) the Lambda Board may not make such a Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change until the third Business Day after receipt by Pi of the Lambda Notice of Change and (y) during such three (3) Business Day period, at the request of Pi, Lambda shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes or modifications to this Agreement which would allow the Lambda Board not to make such Lambda Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary duties. (d) Pi agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or Section 5.4(d) of the Pi Disclosure Letter, neither it nor any of the Pi Subsidiaries shall, and Pi shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of the Pi Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts to, cause their respective Representatives not to (i) directly or indirectly initiate or solicit, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information relating to Pi or any of the Pi Subsidiaries) any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi, (ii) other than clarifying terms of the Acquisition Proposal in accordance with the penultimate sentence of this Section 5.4(d), participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating to Pi or any of the Pi Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of Pi or any of the Pi Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi or to any Person in contemplation of making an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi or (iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi or enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to this Section 5.4) or (B) requiring, intending to cause, or which could reasonably be expected to cause Pi to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Integrated Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement   68

Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Pi Subsidiaries by any Representatives of Pi who are directors or executive officers of Pi, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Pi or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Pi. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to delivery of the Pi Support Agreement, Pi and the Pi Board may take any actions described in clause (ii) in the first sentence of this Section 5.4(d) with respect to a third party if (w) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the delivery of the Pi Support Agreement, Pi receives a written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi from such third party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by Pi or any of the Pi Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives), (x) Pi provides Lambda the notice required by Section 5.4(g) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (y) the Pi Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Pi’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal with respect to Pi, and (z) the Pi Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Pi’s outside legal counsel) that the failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to disclose such information or data to such third party would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided that Pi shall not deliver any information to such third party without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such third party. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Section 5.4(d), and subject to compliance with Pi’s obligations contained in Section 5.4(g), if Pi receives, following the date hereof and prior to the delivery of the Pi Support Agreement, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a knowing and intentional breach of this Section 5.4, Pi and its Representatives may contact the Person or any of such Person’s Representatives who has made such Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such Acquisition Proposal so that Pi may inform itself about such Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit Pi or the Pi Board from taking and disclosing to the Pi Stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law. (e) Neither (i) the Pi Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (A) withhold or withdraw (or amend or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Lambda), or publicly propose or announce any intention to withhold or withdraw (or amend or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Lambda), the Pi Recommendation or the Pi Proposal or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Pi (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a “Pi Adverse Recommendation Change”) nor (ii) shall Pi or any of the Pi Subsidiaries execute or enter into, a Pi Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Pi Stockholder Approval, and subject to Pi’s compliance in all material respects at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.4 and Section 5.3, in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to Pi, that was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by Pi or any of the Pi Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, the Pi Board may make a Pi Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however, that Pi shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Pi Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal with respect to Pi (x) until three (3) Business Days after Pi provides written notice to Lambda (a “Pi Notice”) advising Lambda that the Pi Board or a committee thereof has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal, (y) if during such three (3)   69

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) neither Lambda nor Pi shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of the other party, divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom, or after the Integrated Mergers, the freedom of action of Pi or any of Pi’s Affiliates with respect to, or its ability to retain, Lambda and the Lambda Subsidiaries, Pi or the Pi Subsidiaries, or any of the respective businesses or assets of Pi, Lambda or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates and (ii) neither Pi nor Lambda, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall be required to divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, Lambda and the Lambda Subsidiaries, Pi or the Pi Subsidiaries, or any of the respective businesses or assets of Pi, Lambda or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case if such divestiture or other action with respect thereto would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected have a Lambda Material Adverse Effect or a Pi Material Adverse Effect. 


Section 5.6 Lambda Equity Awards; Lambda Warrants. (a) Lambda Equity Awards. (i) Lambda RSUs. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit (including those subject to performance-based vesting conditions) under a Lambda Benefit Plan (a “Lambda RSU”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall automatically become fully vested and shall without any action on the part of Pi, Lambda or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, a number of shares of Pi Common Stock obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Lambda Common Stock subject to such Lambda RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B) the Exchange Ratio, less applicable Tax withholdings. For purposes of clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to a Lambda RSU will be treated as having been achieved in full (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall result in a number of Lambda RSUs vesting equal to the number of Lambda RSUs granted to the applicable participant on the applicable grant date and not any greater number). (ii) Section 409A. To the extent that any award described in this Section 5.6 constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, any payment contemplated hereby with respect to such award shall be made in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable award’s terms or, if later, at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. (iii) Required Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Lambda Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Lambda Benefit Plan) shall take all such actions as are necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.6, including making any determinations or adopting resolutions of the Lambda Board or a committee thereof or any administrator of a Lambda Benefit Plan as may be necessary. Pi shall take such actions as are necessary for the treatment of the Lambda RSUs pursuant to this Section 5.6, including reservation, issuance and listing of shares of Pi Common Stock as are necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.6.   73

(b) Lambda Warrants. At the Effective Time, each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised Lambda Warrant shall be (i) cancelled and extinguished for no consideration on the Closing Date or (ii) other than the Tranche 2 Warrants, acquired by Pi for a Unit of Transaction Consideration (as defined in the applicable Lambda Warrant Agreement), in each case, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Lambda Warrant Agreement. Lambda and Pi shall cooperate to effectuate the foregoing. 


Section 5.7 Employee and Labor Matters. (a) The following provisions shall apply with respect to the compensation and benefits to be provided after the Effective Time in respect of individuals who are employees of Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain so employed after the Effective Time (the “Lambda Employees”). Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, Lambda and Pi agree that, unless otherwise mutually determined before the Effective Time, for the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending one (1) year following the Effective Time or, if earlier, the date of such Lambda Employee’s termination, (i) the base pay or hourly wage rate, as applicable, of the Lambda Employees shall not be reduced, (ii) the target incentive compensation opportunities of the Lambda Employees shall not be reduced, and (iii) each Lambda Employee shall be provided employee benefits (excluding pension, retiree welfare, nonqualified deferred compensation, equity- and cash-based incentive compensation) that are either substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Lambda Employee immediately before the Effective Time or the same as those provided from time to time to similarly situated employees of Pi or its Subsidiaries. (b) Subject to applicable Law and any obligations under any Labor Agreement, under the benefit and compensation plans of Pi and the Pi Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Lambda Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Lambda Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Lambda and the Lambda Subsidiaries before the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting of 401(k) contributions and level of paid time off benefits, to the same extent and for the same purpose as such Lambda Employee was credited as of the Effective Time for such service under any similar Lambda Benefit Plan; provided that such service crediting shall not be required (i) for purposes of any equity- or -cash-based incentive compensation, (ii) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits nor (ii) to the extent Lambda Employees are affected without regard to whether employment before the Effective Time was with Lambda and the Lambda Subsidiaries (for example, in the event a New Plan is adopted for Lambda Employees under which no participants receive credit for service before the effective date of the New Plan). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (b): (i) each Lambda Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans subject to ERISA to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Lambda Benefit Plan in which such Lambda Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time and such waiting time would not apply to similarly situated employees of Pi under such New Plan, and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Lambda Employee, Pi shall use commercially reasonably efforts to cause (A) all pre-existing   74

condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent waived under the corresponding Lambda Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time and (B) any eligible expenses incurred by and credited to such Lambda Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Lambda Benefit Plan ending on the date such Lambda Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Lambda Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. (c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.7 (whether express or implied) shall (i) create or confer any rights, remedies or claims upon any employee, director, officer, or individual service provider or any right of employment or engagement or continued employment or engagement or any particular term or condition of employment or engagement for any Lambda Employee or any other Person, (ii) be considered or deemed to establish, amend, or modify any Pi Benefit Plan, Lambda Benefit Plan, New Plan, or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement, or contract or (iii) confer any rights or benefits (including any third-party beneficiary rights) on any Person other than the parties to this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall not be construed to prevent the termination of employment of any Lambda Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Lambda Benefit Plan or Pi Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms and subject to compliance with the terms of this Section 5.7. (d) At the written request of Pi provided no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, Lambda (or the applicable Lambda Subsidiary) shall, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, adopt written resolutions (or take other necessary and appropriate action) to terminate, a Lambda Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (“Lambda 401(k) Plan”) and to fully vest all participants under the Lambda 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that such Lambda 401(k) Plan termination may be made contingent upon the Closing. Lambda shall provide Pi with an advance copy of such proposed resolutions (and any related documents) and a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon prior to adoption or execution. (e) Prior to making any broad-based communications to any Lambda Employees pertaining to post-Effective Time compensation or benefit matters that are affected by or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement (including any schedules hereto), Lambda shall provide Pi with a copy of the intended communication (or a written summary of any intended oral communications), and Pi shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication. (f) It is acknowledged and agreed that the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a “change of control” (or “change in control” or transaction of similar import) for purposes of the arrangements identified on Section 5.7(f) of the Lambda Disclosure Letter.   75

Section 5.8 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. (a) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each of Pi and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance expenses in connection therewith) each present and former (i) director and officer of Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries or any other Entity that was serving in such capacity at Lambda’s request or (ii) individual serving as a fiduciary of any benefit plan of Lambda or any Lambda Subsidiary (the “Indemnified Parties”), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages or liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding (including any alternative dispute resolution proceeding) or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to which such Indemnified Party is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness), and arises out of or pertains to the fact, in each case in whole or in part, that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of Lambda or any of the Lambda Subsidiaries or other applicable Person or fiduciary of any Lambda Benefit Plan, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement, the Integrated Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. (b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Pi and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement or advancement of expenses of individuals who were directors, officers or employees prior to the Effective Time than are set forth, as of the date of this Agreement, in Lambda’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. (c) Pi shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (or Pi shall on the Surviving Corporation’s behalf) obtain and fully prepay prior to the Closing “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with recognized insurance companies with the same or better credit rating as Lambda’s current insurance companies for the Persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, are covered by Lambda’s directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance (the “D&O Insurance”), with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as Lambda’s existing D&O Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby), with respect to Lambda’s D&O Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in no event shall Pi or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by Lambda for such insurance; and provided further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation (or Pi on the Surviving Corporation’s behalf) shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Pi shall provide a reasonable opportunity to Lambda to comment on the terms of any endorsements or policies in connection with such “tail” policy.   76

(d) In the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any claims are made in respect of which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.8(d), any Indemnified Party wishing to claim such indemnification shall promptly notify Pi thereof in writing, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Pi or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices Pi or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation: (i) Pi or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof (it being understood that by electing to assume the defense thereof, neither Pi nor the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Party’s entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto or assumed any liability with respect thereto), except that if Pi or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or legal counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Pi or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain legal counsel satisfactory to Pi and to the provider of any insurance obtained in accordance with the foregoing Section 5.8(c), and Pi or the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter as reasonably requested and pay all reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses of such legal counsel for the Indemnified Party as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that (1) Pi and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.8(d) to pay for only one firm of legal counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one legal counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such legal counsel with a conflict of interest (in which case the fewest number of legal counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used) and (2) the Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking to repay all such fees, costs or expenses paid by Pi or the Surviving Corporation if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified by Pi or the Surviving Corporation; (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter if Pi or the Surviving Corporation elects to assume such defense; (iii) Pi and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent and the prior written consent of the provider of any insurance obtained in accordance with the foregoing Section 5.8(c), in each case if Pi or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense; and (iv) Pi and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnified action of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Pi nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any claim, action, suit or other Legal Proceeding (and in which indemnification could be sought by Indemnified Parties hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or other Legal Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing.   77

Without limiting the first sentence of this Section 3(a), during the Applicable Period, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, or at any postponement or adjournment thereof, and in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of the Company (or any class or subdivision thereof) in connection with the Integrated Mergers, such Stockholder shall, and shall cause any holder of record of its Subject Shares on any applicable record date to, vote, in person or by proxy, or deliver a written consent covering, all of its Subject Shares: (i) in favor of adoption of, or consent to, the Merger Agreement and approval of any other matter that is required to be approved by the stockholders of the Company in order to effect the   A-4

Integrated Mergers; (ii) against any merger agreement or merger (other than the Merger Agreement and the Integrated Mergers), consolidation, combination, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets, reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is prohibited by the Merger Agreement (unless, in each case, such transaction is approved in writing by Parent) or any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company; and (iii) against any amendment of the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other proposal or transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which amendment or other proposal or transaction would reasonably be expected to materially delay, impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the Integrated Mergers, the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any outstanding class of capital stock of the Company. During the Applicable Period, in the event that any meeting of the stockholders of the Company is held for the purpose of acting on any matter specified in the immediately preceding sentence, such Stockholder shall (or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all of its Subject Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum. During the Applicable Period, such Stockholder further agrees not to commit or agree, and to cause any record holder of its Subject Shares not to commit or agree, to take any action inconsistent with the foregoing during the Applicable Period. “Applicable Period” means the period from and including the date of this Agreement to and including the date of the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and without limitation of Section 9, (i) the preceding paragraph of this Section 3(a) does not require any Stockholder to vote, or deliver a written consent in respect of, any of its Subject Shares in favor of any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Merger Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests of such Stockholder (whether in manner that is applicable to holders of Company Common Stock generally or otherwise), and (ii) no Stockholder is required to vote, or deliver any written consent in respect of, any of its Subject Shares, in any particular manner or at all, on any matter other than those expressly specified in the preceding paragraph of this Section 3(a), or to appear at, or cause any of its Subject Shares to be counted as present at, any meeting of the stockholders of the Company, or portion thereof, held for the purpose of acting on any such other matter. (b)    Irrevocable Proxy. In order to secure the obligations set forth herein, each Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent, or any nominee thereof, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, as its true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact, only in the event that such Stockholder does not comply with its obligations in Section 3(a), to vote or execute written consents with respect to such Stockholder’s Subject Shares in accordance with Section 3(a) and with respect to any proposed postponements or adjournments of any meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which any of the matters described in Section 3(a) are to be considered. Each Stockholder hereby affirms   A-5








________________


that this proxy is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, except upon termination of this Agreement, and such Stockholder will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by such Stockholder with respect to any of its Subject Shares. This proxy shall be revoked automatically upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5 (whether as to such Stockholder or all Stockholders), and Parent may terminate this proxy at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to each Stockholder. (c)    Transfer Restrictions. Except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 3(c), such Stockholder agrees not to, and to cause any record holder of its Subject Shares, not to, in any such case directly or indirectly, during the Applicable Period (i) Transfer or enter into any agreement, option or other arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) with respect to the Transfer of, any of its Subject Shares (or any interest therein) to any Person, other than the exchange of its Subject Shares for Parent Common Stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement or (ii) grant any proxies, or deposit any of its Subject Shares into any voting trust or enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, with respect to its Subject Shares, other than pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 3(c), such Stockholder further agrees not to commit or agree to take, and to cause any record holder of any of its Subject Shares not to commit or agree to take, any of the foregoing actions during the Applicable Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Stockholder shall have the right to Transfer up to an aggregate of 20% of its Subject Shares if and only if the transferee shall have agreed in writing, in a manner acceptable in form and substance to Parent, (i) to accept such Subject Shares subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) to be bound by this Agreement as if it were “a Stockholder” for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that no such Transfer shall relieve such Stockholder from its obligations under this Agreement with respect to any of its Subject Shares other than the Subject Shares so Transferred. (d)    Adjustment to Subject Shares. In case of a stock dividend or distribution, or any change in the Company Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend or distribution, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the term “Subject Shares”, as used with respect to each Stockholder, shall be deemed to refer to and include such Stockholder’s Subject Shares as well as all such stock dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for which any or all of such Stockholder’s Subject Shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in such transaction. (e)    Non-Solicitation. Except to the extent that the Company or its Board of Directors is permitted to do so under the Merger Agreement, but subject to any limitations imposed on the Company or its Board of Directors under the Merger Agreement, such Stockholder agrees, solely in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their   A-6

Each Stockholder will, and will cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company. Nothing contained in this Section 3(e) shall prevent any Person affiliated with such Stockholder who is a director or officer of the Company or designated by such Stockholder as a director of officer of the Company from taking actions in his capacity as a director or officer of the Company, including taking any actions permitted under Section 5.4 of the Merger Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees that with respect to any damage claim that might be brought against any Stockholder or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement, and without regard to whether such claim sounds in contract, tort or any other legal or equitable theory of relief, that damages are limited to actual damages and expressly waive any right to recover special damages, including, without limitation, lost profits as well as any punitive or exemplary damages. The parties hereto further agree that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware) and any appellate court from any thereof. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents that each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts listed in this Section 8 in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) agrees that each party hereto irrevocably waives the defense of an inconvenient forum and all other defenses to venue in any such court in any such action or proceeding. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN   A-11

RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE ANY OF SUCH WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8. 


9.    No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or any other Person any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of, or with respect to, any Subject Shares. Subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to each Stockholder’s Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to such Stockholder, and this Agreement shall not confer any right, power or authority upon Parent or any other Person to direct any Stockholder in the voting of any of its Subject Shares (except as otherwise specifically provided for herein).

3. Covenants of Each Shareholder. Each Shareholder, severally and not jointly, agrees as follows; provided that all of the following covenants shall apply solely to actions taken by such Shareholder in its capacity as a shareholder of Parent: (a) Agreement to Vote Subject Shares. During the Applicable Period, at any meeting of the shareholders of Parent, however called, or at any postponement or adjournment thereof, such Shareholder shall, and shall cause any holder of record of its Subject Shares on any applicable record date to, vote, in person or by proxy, all of the Subject Shares beneficially owned by such Shareholder on such date, which shall, when combined with any other shares of Pi Preferred Stock with respect to which Juniper Capital Advisors, L.P. has sole or shared voting power (“Juniper Stock”), be no fewer than the number of Subject Shares sufficient to approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement (such issuance of Parent Common Stock, the “Share Issuance,” and such minimum number of Subject Shares, the “Subject Shares Minimum”): (i) in favor of the Share Issuance and approval of any other matter that is required to be approved by the shareholders of Parent in order to effect the Integrated Mergers and (ii) against any proposal made (A) in opposition to the Share Issuance or (B) in support of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent. During the Applicable Period, such Shareholder (and/or its Controlling Entities) shall retain at all times the right to vote the Subject Shares Minimum (when combined with any other Juniper Stock) in such Shareholder’s sole discretion and without any other limitation on those matters other than those set forth in this Section 3(a) that are at any time or from time to time presented for consideration to Parent’s shareholders generally. During the Applicable Period, in the event that any meeting of the shareholders of Parent is held with respect to the Integrated Mergers or Merger Agreement or any transactions contemplated thereby, such Shareholder shall (or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all of the Subject Shares beneficially owned by such Shareholder on such date (which shall be no fewer than the Subject Shares   B-4








________________


Minimum when combined with any other Juniper Stock) to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum. During the Applicable Period, such Shareholder further agrees not to commit or agree, and to cause any record holder of Subject Shares it continues to beneficially own not to commit or agree, to take any action inconsistent with the foregoing during the Applicable Period. “Applicable Period” means the period from and including the date of this Agreement to and including the date of the termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, as used in this Section 3(a) and this Agreement generally, the term “Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Merger Agreement and is modified by the language provided in Sections 4.2 and 5.4(d) of the Pi Disclosure Letter. (b) Irrevocable Proxy. In order to secure the obligations set forth herein, each Shareholder hereby irrevocably appoints the Company, or any nominee thereof, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, as its true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact, only in the event that such Shareholder does not comply with its obligations in Section 3(a), to vote with respect to such Shareholder’s Subject Shares beneficially owned at such time (which shall be no fewer than the Subject Shares Minimum when combined with any other Juniper Stock) in accordance with Section 3(a) and with respect to any proposed postponements or adjournments of any meeting of the shareholders of Parent at which any of the matters described in Section 3(a) are to be considered. Each Shareholder hereby affirms that this proxy is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, except upon termination of this Agreement, and such Shareholder will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by such Shareholder with respect to any of its Subject Shares. This proxy shall be revoked automatically upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5 (whether as to such Shareholder or all Shareholders), and Parent may terminate this proxy at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to each Shareholder. The Company may terminate this proxy at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to each Shareholder. (c) Transfer Restrictions. Except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 3(c), such Shareholder agrees not to, and to cause any record holder of its Subject Shares, not to, in any such case directly or indirectly, during the Applicable Period (i) Transfer or enter into any agreement, option or other arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) with respect to the Transfer of, any of its Subject Shares (or any interest therein) to any Person to the extent such Transfer would reduce such Shareholder’s Subject Shares (when combined with any other Juniper Stock) below the Subject Shares Minimum or (ii) grant any proxies, or deposit any of its Subject Shares into any voting trust or enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, with respect to its Subject Shares to the extent such proxies/deposits would violate Section 3(a) hereof, other than pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the last sentence of this Section   B-5

3(c), such Shareholder further agrees not to commit or agree to take, and to cause any record holder of any Subject Shares it continues to beneficially own not to commit or agree to take, any of the foregoing actions during the Applicable Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Shareholder shall have the right to (a) Transfer its Subject Shares to an Affiliate if such Affiliate shall have agreed in writing, (i) to accept such Subject Shares subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) to be bound by this Agreement as if it were “a Shareholder” for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that no such transfer shall relieve such Shareholder from its obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Subject Shares it continues to beneficially own, and (b) Transfer any number of Subject Shares that would not result in such Shareholder’s ownership (when combined with any other Juniper Stock) falling below the Subject Shares Minimum. (d) Adjustment to Subject Shares. In case of a stock dividend or distribution, or any change in the Pi Preferred Stock by reason of any stock dividend or distribution, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the term “Subject Shares,” as used with respect to such Shareholder, shall be deemed to refer to and include such Shareholder’s Subject Shares as well as all such stock dividends and distributions and any securities into which or for which any or all of such Shareholder’s Subject Shares may be changed or exchanged or which are received in such transaction. (e) Non-Solicitation. Except to the extent that Parent or its Board of Directors is permitted to do so under the Merger Agreement, but subject to any limitations imposed on Parent or its Board of Directors under the Merger Agreement, such Shareholder agrees, solely in its capacity as a shareholder of Parent, that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to (i) directly or indirectly initiate or solicit, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent, (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public information or data relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or to any Person in contemplation of making an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent, or (iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or (B) requiring, intending to cause, or which could reasonably be expected to cause Parent to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Integrated Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each   B-6

Shareholder will, and will cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 3(e) shall prevent any Person affiliated with such Shareholder who is a director or officer of Parent from taking actions in his capacity as a director or officer of Parent, including taking any actions permitted under Section 5.4 of the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, as used in this Section 3(e) and this Agreement generally, the term “Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Merger Agreement and is modified by the language provided in Sections 4.2 and 5.4(d) of the Pi Disclosure Letter. 


4. Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party; provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve any party from liability for any breach hereof prior to such termination.

If any provision of this Agreement or any part of any such provision is held under any circumstances to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then (i) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof under such circumstances and in such jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision or part thereof under any other circumstances or in any other jurisdiction and (ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of such provision or the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement; provided that the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a materially adverse manner to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith in general fashion to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original interest of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the maximum extent possible. (h) Waiver. (i) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.

(i) Further Assurances. Each Shareholder will, from time to time, (i) at the reasonable request of the Company take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement and (ii) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents, documents and other instruments as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of effectively carrying out the intent and purposes of this Agreement. (j) Publicity. Except as otherwise required by law (including securities laws and regulations) and the regulations of any national stock exchange, so long as this Agreement is in effect, no Shareholder shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages.

The parties hereto further agree that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware) and any appellate court from any thereof.

9. No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in the Company or any other Person any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of, or with respect to, any Subject Shares. Subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Agreement, all rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to each Shareholder, and this Agreement shall not confer any right, power or authority upon the Company or any other Person to direct the Shareholders in the voting of any of the Subject Shares (except as otherwise specifically provided for herein).

The registered agent of the Company in the State of Delaware is the initial registered agent named in the certificate of formation; provided that the Member may designate another Person as the registered agent from time to time in the manner provided by law. The principal office of the Company shall be at such place as the Member may designate from time to time, which need not be in the State of Delaware, and the Company shall maintain records there. 3. Purposes. The purpose of the Company is to engage in any business or activity that is not prohibited by the Act. 4. Member. The sole member of the Company is Penn Virginia Corporation (the “Member”).

7. Indemnification; Exculpation. (a) The Company hereby agrees to indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless any Person (each an “Indemnified Person”) to the fullest extent permitted under the Act, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, substituted or replaced (but, in the case of any such amendment, substitution or replacement only to the extent that such amendment, substitution or replacement permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than the Company is providing immediately prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Person by reason of the fact that such Person is or was a member of the Company, is or was serving as an officer or authorized person of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as an officer, manager, director, principal, member, partner, employee or agent of another legal entity, joint venture or other enterprise. Expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by any such Indemnified Person in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. The Company may, by action of the Member, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Company with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of members, officers and authorized persons. (b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any indemnity by the Company shall be provided out of and to the extent of Company assets only, and the Member shall have no personal liability on account thereof or shall not be required to make additional Capital Contributions to help satisfy such indemnity of the Company. (c) The Company hereby acknowledges that certain persons may have rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses (directly or through insurance obtained by any such entity) provided by one or more third parties (collectively, the “Other Indemnitors”), and which may include third parties for whom such person serves as a manager, member, officer, employee or agent. The Company hereby agrees and acknowledges that notwithstanding any such rights that a person may have with respect to any Other Indemnitor(s), (i) the Company is the indemnitor of first resort with respect to all persons and all obligations to indemnify and provide advancement of expenses to persons, (ii) the Company shall be required to indemnify and advance the full amount of expenses incurred by such persons, to the fullest extent required by law. (d) If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Section 7 is not paid in full within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Company, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, to the extent permitted by law, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Company shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law. (e) None of the Indemnified Persons shall be liable to the Member or the Company for mistakes of judgment, or for action or inaction, taken in good faith, or for losses due to such mistakes, action or inaction, or to the negligence, dishonesty, or bad faith of any employee, broker or other agent of the Company, provided that such employee, broker or agent was selected, engaged, or retained with reasonable care. Any party entitled to relief hereunder may consult with legal counsel and accountants in respect of affairs of the Company and be fully protected and justified in any reasonable action or inaction that is taken in good faith in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel or accountants, provided that they shall have been selected with reasonable care. (f) The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this Section 7 shall not be exclusive of any other right which an Indemnified Person may have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory), agreement, vote of the Member or otherwise. 8. LLC Interests; Capital Contributions; Loans. The limited liability company interest in the Company, including the right to a distributive share of profits, losses and other items on income, gain, loss, deduction and credits of the Company, to distributions pursuant to Section 9 and to a distributive share of   C-3








________________


the assets of the Company in a liquidation and winding up, shall be represented by “Units,” which shall include any series of Units created and authorized by the Member after the date hereof; provided that any such series of Units shall the relative rights, powers and duties set forth in this Agreement. The Unit Ownership Ledger attached hereto the number of Units held by the Member and the Capital Contributions made (or deemed to be made) by the Member. The Member is not required to make any Capital Contributions to the Company. The Unit Ownership Ledger will be updated from time to reflect issuances, transfers and repurchases of Units and any additional Capital Contributions. Loans by the Member to the Company shall not be considered Capital Contributions but shall be a liability of the Company, payable or collectible in accordance with the terms upon which such loan is made. 9. Distributions. The Member may, but is not obligated to, cause the Company to make distributions at such time, in such amounts and in such form as determined by the Member. 10. Dissolution. The Company shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up upon the first to occur of the following: (a) the written consent of the Member; or (b) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 18-802 of the Act. 11. Transfers and Assignments. The Member may transfer Units and assign its Membership Interest. 12. Pledge of Units or Membership Interest. The Member may pledge or hypothecate any or all of its Units or Membership Interest to any lender to the Company or any affiliate thereof or to an agent acting on such lender’s behalf. Upon a transfer of any Units or the Member’s Membership Interest pursuant to the exercise of remedies in connection with a pledge or hypothecation: (a) the lender, agent or transferee of such lender or agent, as the case may be, shall become the Member and shall succeed to all of the rights, duties and powers, and shall be bound by all of the obligations, of the Member and (b) following such transfer, the pledging Member shall cease to be a member and shall have no further rights, duties, powers, obligations or liabilities as a member of the Company or otherwise under this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Member shall constitute any necessary approval of such Member under the Act to the foregoing provisions of this Section 12. 13. Amendments. The Member may amend this Agreement at any time; provided that Section 12 may not be amended so long as any Units or the Membership Interest of the Member remain subject to a pledge or hypothecation in favor of any lender to the Company or any affiliate thereof without the pledgee’s (or the transferee of such pledgee’s) prior written consent. Each recipient of a pledge or hypothecation of Units or the Membership Interest (and the transferee of such pledgee) shall be a third party beneficiary of the provisions of Section 12. 14. Tax Matters. The Company will be treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes and for purposes of corresponding provisions of state and local law, provided that if two or more Persons are members of the Company, the Company will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and for purposes of corresponding provisions of state and local law. 15. Observance of Formalities. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Act to the contrary, the failure of the Company, the Member or any officer or authorized person to observe any formalities or procedural or other requirements relating to the exercise of its rights, duties, powers or management of the Company’s business and affairs under this Agreement or the Act shall not be grounds for imposing personal liability on the Member. 16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed under, the laws of the State of Delaware, all rights and remedies being governed by said laws.   C-4

(iv)          adjust the terms of all outstanding Director RSUs as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such Director RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive, for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Director RSU, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the Merger Consideration;   (v)          distribute all Accumulated Dividend Equivalents to the applicable holders of Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Director RSUs; and   (vi)          make such other changes to the Company Stock Plan or the Director Stock Plan as the Company and Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.   (b)          With respect to any amount payable under Section 3.2(a) that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that payment of such amount would otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under this Agreement and the terms of the corresponding award that will not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty.   (c)          As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that (i) with respect to any Offering Period (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) in progress as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Offering Period shall terminate and any option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company ESPP shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) the date on which such Offering Period would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period(s) shall commence under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, (ii) no individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement, (iii) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement and (iv) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d)          All payments described in Section 3.2(a) (other than with respect to Director RSUs) shall be paid through the payroll system or payroll provider of the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (no later than the second regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate following the Closing Date).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such payment cannot be made through such payroll system or payroll provider (including any payment with respect to Director RSUs), then the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate will issue a check for such payment promptly following the Closing Date (and in any event no later than 10 Business Days thereafter).  Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate, by wire transfer of immediately available funds at or promptly following the Effective Time, the amount of any such payments to the extent that the Surviving Corporation’s or its applicable Affiliate’s cash as of the Effective Time is insufficient to fund such payments.   Section 3.3          Payment for Securities.   (a)          Paying Agent; Exchange Fund.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with an entity designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) and to receive the Merger Consideration.  On the Closing Date and prior to or immediately following the filing of the Articles of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).  The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.  Except as contemplated by this Section 3.3(a), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration.  Any interest or other income resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund.   (b)          Payment Procedures.   (i)          As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to deliver to each record holder of, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”) a letter of transmittal in the Paying Agent’s customary form (“Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration.   23

(ii)         Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, delivery of a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate.  No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration or on any unpaid dividends and other distributions payable in respect of the Certificates.  If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any applicable transfer and other Taxes and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b)(ii), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, subject to the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been authorized by the Company (subject to this Agreement) and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.   (iii)        As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than three Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to exchange any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) in accordance with the Paying Agent’s customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry; provided that the payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.  No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration or on any unpaid dividends and other distributions payable in respect of the Certificates.  Until exchanged as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b)(iii), each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such exchange the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, subject to the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been authorized by the Company (subject to this Agreement) and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.   (c)          Termination Rights.  All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation to be closed immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates (other than Certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(b)), without any interest thereon.   24

(d)          Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of their claim for such amounts.   (e)          No Liability.  None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law.  If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (f)          Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  If any Certificate (other than a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 3.1(a)(iii)) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.   (g)          Dissenter’s Rights.  No holder of any shares of Company Common Stock will have or be entitled to assert dissenter’s rights or any other rights of appraisal, pursuant to the NRS or otherwise, as a result of or in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.   (h)          Withholding Taxes.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from the amounts otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock or holder of equity or equity-based awards under the Company Stock Plan pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, determines are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payments under applicable Law.  To the extent that amounts are so properly deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or holder of the equity or equity-based awards in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.  If Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent determines that any amounts are required to be deducted or withheld (other than any deduction or withholding with respect to any payments constituting compensation for services), Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, prior to deducting or withholding such amounts, notify the holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding is to be made and shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to establish or obtain any exemption from or reduction in the amount of any withholding that otherwise would be required.   25

(the “Equity Fund”) pursuant to which the Equity Fund has committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with equity financing for the purpose of consummating the Transactions (the equity financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter, being referred to as the “Equity Financing” and, together with the Debt Financing, the “Financing”).  As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitment Letters have not been amended, waived or modified by or with the consent of Parent or Merger Sub, and the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect, and no such amendment, waiver, modification, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated.  Except for the Debt Commitment Letter, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has entered into any side letters or other contracts, instruments or other commitments, obligations or arrangements (whether written or oral) related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than (i) as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and delivered to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) customary engagement letters or nondisclosure or non-reliance agreements that do not impact the conditionality or aggregate amount of the Financing.  With respect to any commitment letter (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto and any associated fee letter) governing any Replacement Commitment Facility (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter, dated as of the date hereof) (the “Replacement Facility Commitment Letter”), the Parties agree that upon delivery to the Company of a fully executed version thereof that is permitted under Section 6.15, the Replacement Facility Commitment Letter shall be deemed a “Debt Commitment Letter” hereunder and Parent shall be deemed to, as of such date of delivery, make the same representations and agree to the same covenants contained herein with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter regarding such Replacement Facility Commitment Letter. 


(b)          The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and the other parties thereto.  The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, the other parties thereto.  As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred and on the Closing Date, no event shall have occurred and be continuing, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or any other parties thereto under any term or condition of the Financing Commitment Letter.  Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all commitment fees, any other fees or any other amounts required by the Financing Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement and Parent and Merger Sub represent that it shall fully pay or cause to be paid any other fees or other amounts that are due under the Financing Commitment Letter or any related fee letter.  Other than as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter and assuming the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article VII at the Closing, there are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financing and there are no contractual contingencies or other provisions under any agreement (including any side letters) relating to the Transactions to which Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective Affiliates is a party that would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Financing or impose any additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing or that could affect the timing or termination of the Financing.  Assuming the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article VII at the Closing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing to be satisfied by it will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent and Merger Sub immediately prior to the Closing.

________________


(c)          Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article VII at the Closing, (A) the aggregate proceeds of the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitment Letter, will provide financing sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts payable in respect of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Director RSUs under this Agreement) and to pay all related fees and expenses required to be paid on such date and (B) assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article IV, upon the consummation of the Transactions, the Surviving Corporation, together with its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent. 


(d)          Without limiting Section 9.9, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder. 


Section 5.6           Information Supplied.  None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13e‑3 will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to Parent’s stockholders (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.  No representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements included or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. 


Section 5.7           Litigation.  As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 


Section 5.8           Brokers and Other Advisors.  No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial advisor’s or other similar fee or commission payable by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates. 


Section 5.9           Ownership of Company Common Stock.  None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the “affiliates” or “associates” of any such Person is, and at no time during the last two years has been, an “interested stockholder” of the Company (in each case, as such terms are defined in the NRS).  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub “owns” (as such term is defined in the NRS) any shares of capital stock of, or any security convertible or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock of, the Company other than as a result of this Agreement.

Section 5.10         Guarantee.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed guarantee of the Equity Fund, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company pursuant to which the Equity Fund has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, guaranteed certain of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations arising pursuant to this Agreement (the “Guarantee”).  The Guarantee is (a) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Equity Fund, (b) enforceable against the Equity Fund in accordance with its terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies, whether considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity) and (c) in full force and effect and has not been (and will not be) amended or modified, except as permitted thereby.  There is no default or breach under the Guarantee by the Equity Fund, and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the Equity Fund under such Guarantee. 


Section 5.11         Taxes.  Parent has no Knowledge of any (a) facts that are reasonably likely to cause any prior transactions from and since the Distribution Date in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary was treated as either a “distributing corporation” or a “controlled corporation” (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) to not qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 (including by reason of Section 355(e)) or 361 of the Code, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (b) breach by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of the Tax Matters Agreement, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 


Section 5.12         Certain Arrangements.  There are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements, obligations or understandings, whether written or oral, between Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Fund or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any stockholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or any of Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, relating in any way to the Company, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Surviving Corporation (including with respect to the voting, acquisition or disposition of the capital stock or other equity interests of the Company, the management or control of the Company or any employment, consulting or other arrangements) after the Effective Time. 


Section 5.13         No Other Representations or Warranties; Reliance Disclaimer.  Except for the representations and warranties set forth in this Article V, none of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any other Person makes or has made any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided to the Company in connection with the Transactions.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives, disclaims reliance on any representations or warranties or other information provided to them by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives or any other Person except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article IV.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives, acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or other obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub (including their respective Representatives), or Parent’s or Merger Sub’s (or such Representatives’) use of, any such information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent or Merger Sub in certain “data rooms” or management presentations in expectation of the Merger.

(e)          Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in or otherwise making any investment in, or by any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire or make any investment in any assets, or agree to any commercial or strategic relationship with any Person, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger, consolidation, investment or commercial or strategic relationship would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay beyond five Business Days prior to the Outside Date in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any consent, approval, authorization, declaration, waiver, license, franchise, permit, certificate or order of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii)  delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby beyond five Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

Section 6.11         Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. 


(a)          Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the Company’s Organizational Documents, or, if applicable, the Company Subsidiaries’ Organizational Documents, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation) to (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and also with respect to any such Person, in such Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other Benefit Plan or enterprise (regardless of whether such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the Company) serving at the request of or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by, and subject to the conditions and procedures set forth in, applicable Law in connection with any Proceeding and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, Judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security; provided, however, that the payment of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay all amounts so paid in advance if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified.  The indemnification and advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 6.11 extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Proceeding relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Proceeding relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement and inure to the benefit of such person’s heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.11(a), upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it may have under this Section 6.11(a), except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party’s position with respect to such claims).  As used in this Section 6.11, the (A) term “Indemnification Expenses” means reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and expenses and all other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including experts’ fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Proceeding for which indemnification is required to be provided pursuant to this Section 6.11(a), including any Proceeding relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party and (B) the phrase “to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law” includes (1) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any provision of the NRS that authorizes or permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the NRS, and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the NRS adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an entity may indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries or persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party serves; provided that any amendment, alteration or repeal of the NRS that adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, be prospective only and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any Judgment in any actual or threatened Proceeding in respect of which indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or Judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b)          Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company’s Organizational Documents or the Company Subsidiaries’ Organizational Documents will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 


(c)          Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation’s Organizational Documents and each Company Subsidiary’s Organizational Documents will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Company’s Organizational Documents and such Company Subsidiary’s Organizational Documents, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law, and then only to the minimum extent required by Law; provided, however, that, unless required by Law, any such modification shall, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to modification; provided, further, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding made within such period continue until the disposition of such Proceeding. 


(d)          For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will (subject to the next sentence) maintain in full effect the current directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but may substitute therefor other policies containing terms, conditions and limits no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the current policies so long as that substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring on or before the Effective Time, but Parent is not required to pay annual premiums in excess of 350% of the last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date of this Agreement and will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in this Section 6.11(d) would cost in excess of that amount.  The Company may, and, if requested by Parent, shall use reasonable best efforts to, on or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a six-year prepaid tail directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policy with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such, providing coverage on terms and conditions and with limits not less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the policies currently in place for directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability.

(f)           Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11.

Section 6.12         Section 16 Matters.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Prior to taking the actions required by this Section 6.12, the Company will provide Parent copies of any resolutions or other documentation with respect to such actions and the Company shall give consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent. 


Section 6.13         Employee Matters. 


(a)          For a period of one year after the Effective Time (the “Continuation Period”), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who is an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any such employees who are on disability or other approved leave), other than an employee whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of which shall be respected by Parent and the Surviving Corporation (the “Continuing Employee”), for so long as the Continuing Employee is employed by the Surviving Corporation during the Continuation Period, (i) base salary or wages that is no less favorable than as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) bonus and incentive opportunities (other than equity or equity-based compensation opportunities) that are each no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee under Company Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) employee benefits and arrangements (other than base salary or wages, bonus and incentive opportunities, equity or equity-based compensation opportunities, defined benefit pension plan benefits, retiree welfare benefits, early retirement benefits and severance benefits) to Continuing Employees that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(b)          The pool for the Company’s short-term incentive plan for the fiscal year ending April 2, 2021 (the “FY 2021 STIP”) shall be funded based on the greater of target or actual performance for such fiscal year, and FY 2021 STIP payments for such fiscal year shall be determined in the Company’s ordinary course of business consistent with past practice for each participant in the FY 2021 STIP as of the last day of such fiscal year and paid by the Company (or, following the Effective Time, by Parent or the Surviving Corporation) on or before June 1, 2021. 


(c)          If the Effective Time occurs after April 2, 2021, Parent shall pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later than ten days following the Effective Time), to each Continuing Employee that is a participant in the Company’s short-term incentive plan for the fiscal year commencing April 3, 2021 (the “FY 2022 STIP”) an amount in cash equal to the Continuing Employee’s target incentive payment under the FY 2022 STIP, prorated for the number of days that have elapsed in such fiscal year through and including the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the “FY 2022 STIP Stub Payment”). In connection with the subsequent determination of the incentive payments payable under the FY 2022 STIP for the full fiscal year commencing April 3, 2021, any such incentive payment otherwise payable to a Continuing Employee may be offset and reduced by the amount of the FY 2022 STIP Stub Payment previously paid to such Continuing Employee. 


(d)          To the extent Parent causes a Continuing Employee to cease to be eligible to participate in a Company Benefit Plan and instead provides for such Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate in a Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates (the “Replacement Plans”), if such Replacement Plan is a group health plan, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit (or cause to be credited) such Continuing Employee, for the plan year during which such coverage under such Replacement Plan begins, with any deductibles and copayments already incurred during such plan year under the comparable Company Benefit Plan to the extent such credit was provided under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their Affiliates, and the Replacement Plans shall recognize each Continuing Employee’s years of service and level of seniority with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including service and seniority with any other employer that was recognized by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) for purposes of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting and benefit determination (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under the Replacement Plans, except where such recognition of service would result in a duplication of benefits. Parent shall cause each Replacement Plan to waive any preexisting condition exclusion or restriction with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to a Continuing Employee to the extent such exclusion or restriction did not apply with respect to such employee under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.

(e)          From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor their respective obligations under all employment, severance, change in control, bonus and other agreements and plans, and to assume any such agreements and plans that require or contemplate assumption by their terms by an acquirer or successor, as such agreements and plans may be amended or terminated in accordance with their terms. 


(f)          Parent or its applicable Affiliate will assume and honor all vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned but not yet taken by each Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date.

The provisions of this Section 6.13 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary), other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. 


Section 6.14         Transaction Litigation.

The Company shall consult with Parent on a regular basis with respect to, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of, any security holder litigation or other Proceeding against the Company or its respective directors relating to the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.14, nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information if the Company reasonably determines that such disclosure would (a) constitute a violation of any Contract with respect to confidentiality or non-disclosure owing to a third party (including any Governmental Entity) to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, (b) constitute a violation of any applicable Law or (c) result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege; provided that information shall be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent to the extent that the Company determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws.

Section 6.15         Financing. 


(a)          Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts (which such “reasonable best efforts” shall not be deemed to require Parent or Merger Sub to incur any fees or out-of-pocket expenses to the Lenders in connection therewith that are in excess of those specified in the Debt Commitment Letter) to take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary to arrange as promptly as reasonably practicable prior to the Closing (i) the Financing on the terms and conditions (including any “market flex” provisions included in any related fee letter) set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter or on such other terms that would not be prohibited by Section 6.15(b) or (ii) in the event all or any portion of the Financing pursuant to the Financing Commitment Letter becomes unavailable, the Alternative Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Alternative Commitment Letter (including any “market flex” provisions included in any fee letter relating thereto) or on such other terms as would not be prohibited by Section 6.15(b).  Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain the Financing Commitment Letter (or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing, including any Replacement Commitment Facility) in effect until the earlier of the initial funding of the Financing, the termination thereof in accordance with their respective terms or the effectiveness of the Financing Agreements, (B) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any “market flex” provisions included in any related fee letter) or on such other terms that would not be prohibited by Section 6.15(b) (the “Financing Agreements”) and shall deliver to the Company a copy thereof as promptly as practicable, and upon the effectiveness thereof, maintain the Financing Agreements in effect until the initial funding of the Financing or the termination thereof in accordance with their respective terms, (C) comply with the obligations that are set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements that are within its control, (D) fully enforce the rights of Parent and Merger Sub under the Financing Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements, and (E) arrange for the Financing to be available for Parent and Merger Sub to draw upon and consummate at or prior to the Closing.  In the event the Debt Financing in the amounts set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, or any portion thereof, becomes unavailable, or it becomes reasonably likely that it may become unavailable, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any “market flex” provisions included in any related fee letter) or the Financing Agreements, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts (which such “reasonable best efforts” shall not be deemed to require Parent or Merger Sub to incur any fees or out-of-pocket expenses to the Lenders in connection therewith that are in excess of those specified in the Debt Commitment Letter) to obtain promptly alternative financing, from the same or alternative financing sources, in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions (“Alternative Financing”), and not containing conditions or other terms that would reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof that (1) are more onerous or materially less favorable than those conditions and terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or (2) would reasonably be expected to delay the Closing and is otherwise on terms that are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, and to obtain, and, when obtained, to provide promptly to the Company a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the “Alternative Commitment Letter”) and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein (the “Alternative Financing Agreements”).  In the event any Alternative Financing is obtained, any reference in this Agreement to “Financing” shall include such Alternative Financing, any reference to “Financing Commitment Letter” shall include the Alternative Commitment Letter with respect to such Alternative Financing, any reference to “Lenders” shall include the financial institutions providing such Alternative Financing, and any reference to “Financing Agreements” shall include any definitive agreements with respect to such Alternative Commitment Letter, and all obligations of each Party pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as such Party’s obligations, as the case may be, with respect to the Financing.  Any Replacement Commitment Facility and, to the extent replacing the Debt Financing, the Opco Debt Financing must satisfy the same requirements as would apply to Alternative Financing pursuant to this Section 6.15. Parent shall promptly pay or cause to be paid all commitment, engagement or arrangement fees, ticking fees, structuring fees, upfront fees or similar fees and expenses associated with the Financing (including as a result of the exercise of any “market flex” provisions in any fee letter by the Lenders) (the “Commitment Fee Expenses”).

(b)          Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the Company informed on a prompt basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company drafts (reasonably in advance of execution) and thereafter complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing Agreements.  Without limitation of the obligations of Parent under this Agreement, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to give the Company prompt written notice if Parent becomes aware of (i) any actual or threatened in writing breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements; (ii) any actual or threatened in writing withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by any of the Lenders; (iii) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the parties to the Financing Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements relating to, or otherwise potentially affecting, the amount or the availability of the Financing on the Closing Date or satisfaction of the conditions thereunder; and (iv) any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Financing Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Financing less likely or adversely impact Company’s ability to enforce its rights under the Financing Commitment Letter or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, co- managers, syndication agents or other financing sources who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof in connection therewith and amend the economic and other arrangements with respect to the appointment of such exiting and additional entities; provided, further, that any such amendments shall not reduce the aggregate proceeds of the Financing below such amount as is required to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.  Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice if Parent believes in good faith that Parent will not be able to timely obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements.  Parent shall keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing, including by providing copies of then-current drafts of the Financing Agreements and providing copies of all definitive Financing Agreements, in each case, upon written request by the Company.  Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement, restate, substitute, replace, terminate, or agree to any waiver under the Financing Commitment Letter (including replacing the Debt Financing with the Opco Debt Financing) in a manner that (A) adds new or expands upon the conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter, (B) would reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing provided for under the Financing Commitment Letter, (C) would limit the rights and remedies of Parent as against the Lenders or (D) would otherwise prevent or delay or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) Parent may implement any of the “market flex” provisions exercised by the Lenders in accordance with any related fee letter as of the date hereof (or, in respect of any Alternative Financing, in accordance with the “market flex” provisions exercised by the Lenders in accordance with any fee letter relating thereto), (2) additional lenders and financing sources, and Affiliates thereof, may be added (including in replacement of a Lender) to the Debt Commitment Letter (or all or a portion of the commitments may be assigned to new or existing lenders and financing sources) after the date hereof or thereof and Parent may reallocate commitments or assign or re-assign titles and roles to or among parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and (3) Parent may amend the Equity Commitment Letter to increase the amount of Equity Financing available thereunder.  Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of Company, take or fail to take any action or enter into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letter.

(e)          In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (Outside Date) and the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (Parent Breach) or Section 8.1(j) (Failure to Close) but for such termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent Termination Fee within two Business Days of termination of this Agreement. 


(f)           Any payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee will be made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by the recipient of such payment.

Each of the Parties further acknowledges that the payment of the Company Termination Fee by the Company or the Parent Termination Fee by Parent, as applicable, is not a penalty, but, in each case, is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.  If the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to promptly pay the amount due by it pursuant to this Section 8.4, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

(h)          Subject in all respects to the Company’s rights set forth in Section 9.9 and the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under Section 6.16(e), (i) the Company’s right to (A) terminate this Agreement and (B) receive the Parent Termination Fee (if and only if such fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.4(d) or Section 8.4(e)), together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.4(g), shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (other than as provided in Section 9.9, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries against the Parent Related Parties for any breach, loss or damages suffered as a result or arising out of this Agreement, the Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, any other documents and instruments executed by any Parent Related Party pursuant hereto, the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the foregoing (in each case other than the Confidentiality Agreement), including the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and (ii) upon payment of such amount (if and only if such fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.4(d) or Section 8.4(e)), the Parent Related Parties shall not have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, any other documents and instruments executed by any Parent Related Party pursuant hereto, the Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated by the foregoing (in each case other than the Confidentiality Agreement).  For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall be permitted to seek both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.9 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this Section 8.4.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall be permitted to seek both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.9 and the payment of the Company Termination Fee under this Section 8.4. 


(j)           As used herein, (i) “Company Termination Fee” means a cash amount equal to $97,013,974 and (ii) “Parent Termination Fee” means a cash amount equal to $242,534,936.

(l)           While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.9 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under this Section 8.4, under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the consummation of the Merger and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable. 


(m)         Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions.

It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over such matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.  Each Party agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance and further agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each Party further agrees that neither the Other Party nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.9, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

ARTICLE II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 


Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

As of the Effective Time, all Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest. 


(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, or any merger, consolidation or other event or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, to reflect such event so as to provide Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 


Section 2.2 Treatment of Company Equity Awards. 


(a) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit that is solely subject to time-based vesting requirements (each, a “Company RSU Award”) granted under the Forterra, Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan or the Forterra, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Company Stock Plan”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such vested Company RSU Award. Following the Effective Time, no Company RSU Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of any Company RSU Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.2(a) in exchange for such Company RSU Award in accordance with this Section 2.2(a). 


(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements granted under the Company Stock Plan (each, a “Company PSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately vest (based on the level of achievement of the applicable performance goals set forth below) and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such vested Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time as determined pursuant to the following sentence. For purposes of this Section 2.2(b), the number of Shares subject to outstanding Company PSU Awards that shall vest shall be determined based on the greater of (x) the level of actual performance achieved prior to the Effective Time as reasonably determined by a duly authorized committee of the Company Board using the information available through the latest practicable date prior to the Effective Time and otherwise consistent with past practice and (y) the target level of performance set forth in each applicable restricted stock unit award agreement. Following the Effective Time, no Company PSU Award that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of any Company PSU Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.2(b) in exchange for such Company PSU Award in accordance with this Section 2.2(b).   4

(c) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares (each, a “Company Option”) granted under the Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest, to the extent not vested previously, and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the remainder, if positive of (A) the Merger Consideration minus (B) the exercise price per Share of such Company Option multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such vested Company Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the exercise price per Share of a Company Option exceeds or equals the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time for no consideration. Following the Effective Time, no Company Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of any Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.2(c) in exchange for such Company Option in accordance with this Section 2.2(c). 


(d) At the Effective Time, each Share that is subject to any vesting restrictions (each, a “Company Restricted Share” and together with the Company RSU Awards, the Company PSU Awards and the Company Options, the “Company Equity Awards”) granted under the Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately vest in full and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the Merger Consideration. Following the Effective Time, no Company Restricted Share that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each former holder of any Company Restricted Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.2(d) in exchange for such Company Restricted Share in accordance with this Section 2.2(d). 


(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or a duly authorized committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions as may be reasonably required to (i) effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.2 and (ii) terminate the Company Stock Plan and all outstanding awards thereunder subject to receipt of the consideration set forth in this Section 2.2. The Surviving Corporation shall pay through its payroll the amounts due in accordance with this Section 2.2 no later than the later of (i) the next scheduled payroll payment date following the Effective Time and (ii) three Business Days following the Effective Time; provided that, with respect to any Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code (as defined below), settlement of such award shall be made on the earliest permissible date that such delivery would not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.   5

Section 2.3 Exchange and Payment. 


(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with the Company’s transfer agent to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”) to receive the Merger Consideration to which stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.1 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article II, except as provided in this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by it in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration and other amounts contemplated by this Article II. 


(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares that were outstanding and represented by one or more certificates (“Certificates”) immediately prior to the Effective Time and were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form of the Paying Agent as agreed to by Parent and shall include a customary waiver of rights as a former equityholder of the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate (without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated Shares that were outstanding and represented by book entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Book-Entry Shares”) a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 


(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person (as defined below) other than the Person in whose name any Share represented by any surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Share represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. 


(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book- Entry Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1(a), without any interest thereon.   6

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such amount, the “DTC Payment”), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment. 


(f) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. 


(g) The Paying Agent shall not invest any cash included in the Payment Fund unless otherwise directed by Parent; provided, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to satisfy fully all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency of cash required to satisfy fully such cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be for the sole benefit of the Surviving Corporation and shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation. 


(h) At any time following the date that is one year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to former holders of Shares represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.   7

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder’s compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 


Section 2.4 Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Equity Awards or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided, that Parent shall consult with the Principal Stockholder in good faith prior to withholding any amounts payable to any Company stockholder hereunder other than in connection with a Company Equity Award. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 


Section 2.5 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly and validly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and does not vote such Shares in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing (“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder’s right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a), subject to applicable withholding pursuant to Section 2.4. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal (including providing Parent with copies of all notices and demands) and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or compromise or settle, any such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL.   8

execution and delivery by the Company constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally or by general principles of equity).

Section 4.7 Financing. 


(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of one or more duly executed debt commitment letters, dated as of the date of this Agreement, among Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources thereto (such letters, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, as may be amended or modified in accordance with the terms thereof, the “Debt Commitment Letters”, and together with the Fee Letters, the “Financing Letters”) pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein (together with any Alternate Debt Financing, the “Debt Financing”).

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change or to so terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii), as applicable, would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 


(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event (as defined below), the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if all of the following conditions are met:

If at any time prior to the Closing any event shall occur, or fact or information shall be discovered, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable notify the other parties and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or supplement, in consultation with and subject to review by Parent as promptly as practicable and, to the extent required by Law, cause such amendment or supplement to be disseminated to the holders of Shares entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, the parties shall not be required, after the date of termination, to prepare, file and mail the Information Statement pursuant to this Section 5.5(b). 


(c) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent shall duly execute and deliver, in accordance with the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, a written consent duly adopting this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which written consent shall thereupon become effective in accordance with its terms, the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, and promptly following the effectiveness of such written consent Parent shall provide a copy of such duly executed written consent to the Company.   41

actions, including (1) cooperating with Parent in negotiating any divestiture, licensing, holding separate or similar arrangements involving the business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (2) making the management team and other personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries available for management presentations, due diligence sessions and other meetings requested by potential buyers, (3) responding promptly to reasonable due diligence requests from, and making information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries available to, potential buyers, to the extent permitted by Law and subject to customary confidentiality obligations of such potential buyers and (4) providing potential buyers with access to the facilities and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the case of each of the foregoing during normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice. The agreements made in this Section 5.7 do not constitute an admission that the consummation of the Merger, if consummated without the taking of any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding sentence, would violate any Antitrust Law or that the taking of any such actions would not be harmful to the parties. Parent and its Affiliates shall not acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise) if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining, or materially delay receipt of, any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under the HSR Act with respect to this Agreement. 


(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all commercially and/or competitively sensitive information and materials of a party will be provided to the other party on an outside counsel only basis while, to the extent feasible, making a version in which the commercial and/or competitively sensitive information has been redacted available to the other party. 


(g) For purposes of this Agreement: 


(i) “Antitrust Law” means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, any other Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition. 


(ii) The “Detriment Limit” would be exceeded if the assets, businesses or product lines required to be sold, divested, conveyed, held separate, licensed or subject to similar arrangements in order to obtain the expiration of all waiting periods, approvals, consents and non-actions from Governmental Entities under Antitrust Law include assets, businesses or product lines accounting for, either individually or in the aggregate, more than $80,000,000 of EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020. The parties agree that such calculation of EBITDA shall be measured using the lowest such EBITDA of Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries for each such overlapping asset, business or product line required to be sold, divested, conveyed, held separate, licensed or subject to a similar arrangement, regardless of which asset, business or product line is actually sold, divested, conveyed, held separate, licensed or subject to a similar arrangement; provided, that the sale, divestiture, holding separate, licensing or subjecting to a similar arrangement of the asset, business or product line representing such lowest EBITDA would satisfy the requirement of such Governmental Entities with respect to the applicable overlapping asset, business or product line.   45

(iii) “EBITDA” means (A) with respect to the assets, businesses or product lines of the Company and its Subsidiaries, EBITDA as calculated in a manner consistent with the methodology utilized in the earnings releases the Company has publicly filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, excluding any allocation of corporate level expenses and (B) with respect to the assets, businesses or product lines of Parent and its Subsidiaries, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs and any non-recurring and extraordinary items, calculated in accordance with the past reporting practices of Parent and its Subsidiaries, excluding any allocation of corporate level expenses. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date of this Agreement, it has provided to the other party certain documents and information on the historical EBITDA of certain assets, businesses or product lines of such party and its Subsidiaries, for the sole purpose of illustrating how EBITDA shall be calculated for such assets, businesses or product lines pursuant to clause (A) or (B), as applicable, of this Section 5.7(g)(iii). 


Section 5.8 Employee Matters. 


(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and whose employment continues with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from the Closing Date (each, a “Continuing Employee”), for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the one-year anniversary thereof (or, if shorter, the employee’s remaining period of employment) with (i) an annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than the annual base salary or hourly wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity and other long-term incentive awards, change in control and retention bonuses, defined benefit pension plans and post-employment welfare benefits) that are, on an aggregate basis, at least substantially comparable to the benefits (excluding equity and other long-term incentive awards, change in control and retention bonuses, defined benefit pension plans and post-employment welfare benefits) provided by the Company to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. 


(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service credited under each Company Plan in which each Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting and vacation and severance benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any other plan, program or policy, including any defined benefit pension plans) under any plan, program or policy maintained for the benefit of Continuing Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation (each, a “Parent Plan”), to the same extent recognized by the Company under such Company Plan; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits for purposes of benefit accrual. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a “group health plan” within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition, actively at work requirement, waiting period, or other eligibility limitation to the extent such preexisting condition, actively at work requirement, waiting period, or other eligibility limitation was not applicable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time under any comparable   46

Company Plan and (ii) for the plan year in which Continuing Employees of the Company transition from any Company Plan that is a “group health plan” within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code to another comparable Parent Plans that is a “group health plan” within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code (excluding any flexible spending account or similar arrangement), give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Continuing Employees under similar Company Plans immediately prior to such benefit plan transition date. 


(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 90 days thereafter, not to effectuate a “plant closing” or “mass layoff” as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or in any similar state or local Law affecting in whole or in part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or Continuing Employee. 


(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly, and in all events by no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least five Business Days following the Closing Date, pay through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll the amounts due to participants under the LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd. Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, and the award agreements thereunder (collectively, the “LSF9 LTIP”), without interest and subject to applicable Tax withholdings, as directed by the Principal Stockholder. Section 5.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an illustrative calculation, utilizing various assumed payment dates set forth in such calculation, of the maximum aggregate amounts payable under the LSF9 LTIP. In accordance with the terms of that certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as of October 19, 2016, the Company shall cause the Principal Stockholder to deposit with the Company, by no later than the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of such amounts payable to the participants under the LSF9 LTIP, including the employer portion of all related payroll Taxes. The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the LSF9 LTIP effective as of immediately following the Closing and to ensure that participants under the LSF9 LTIP have no further rights thereunder other than the right to receive their payments as described in this Section 5.8(d). The Company shall provide Parent prior to the Closing with evidence, reasonably acceptable to Parent, regarding the action taken to effectuate the foregoing. 


(e) At least ten days (or such shorter period agreed to by the parties) prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take, all actions reasonably requested in writing by Parent at least thirty days prior to the Closing Date (or such shorter period reasonably agreed to by the parties) that may be necessary or appropriate to, conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing Date, (i) cause one or more Company Plans to terminate as of a date on, immediately before or after the Closing Date (as determined by Parent), (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any Company Plan to cease as of the Closing Date, or as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date, (iii) cause the continuation on and after the Closing Date of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy relating to any Company Plan for such period as may be reasonably requested by the Parent, and/or (iv) facilitate the merger of any Company Plan into any Parent Plan in accordance with applicable Law. All resolutions, notices, or other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this Section 5.8(e) shall be subject to Parent’s reasonable prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, no such Company Plan amendments, modifications or terminations shall in any way reduce, mitigate or eliminate Parent’s obligations under Section 5.8(a).   47

(d) If the Company has not purchased such tail policy prior to the Effective Time, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a “tail policy,” in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; provided further, that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a “tail policy” and the annual coverage thereunder costs more than 300% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 300% of such last annual premium. 


(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) for which any Indemnified Party may have rights to indemnification, exculpation or advancement hereunder is instituted on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Action. 


(f) The indemnification, exculpation and rights to advancement provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives (and following the Effective Time may not be amended without their prior written consent). 


(g) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person (by merger, consolidation, division, operation of law or otherwise), then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.   50

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 


Section 5.13 Public Announcements. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The restrictions set forth in this Section 5.13 shall not apply to any press release or statement issued or proposed to be issued in connection with, or in response to, an Adverse Recommendation Change, an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Letters, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, permit or grant any withdrawal, rescindment, amendment, replacement, supplement, consent or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing Letters or any definitive agreement relating to the Debt Financing if such withdrawal, rescindment, amendment, replacement, supplement, consent, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount such that Parent and Merger Sub would not have the Required Funds (after taking into account funds otherwise available from internally generated cash flow); (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing (including expanding the information required to be provided by the Company) or any other terms to the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the Closing; or (B) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing, materially less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. Parent shall promptly furnish to the Company a true and complete copy of any amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, consent or waiver relating to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the “Debt Financing” will include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified and (2) “Debt Commitment Letters” or “Financing Letters” will include such documents as amended or modified. Parent shall not release or consent to the termination of any individual lender under the Debt Commitment Letters, except for (x) assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms of, and only in connection with, the syndication of the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letters; or (y) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with alternative financing commitments pursuant to Section 5.14(d).   51

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on a timely basis, but in any event no later than the Closing Date, on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the full exercise of any “flex” provisions in any Fee Letter) described in the Financing Letters, including using their reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate, enter into, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters on a timely basis on the terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions in any Fee Letter) contemplated by the Financing Letters; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions that are within its control and applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in the Financing Letters and such definitive agreements related thereto on or prior to the Closing Date; (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, including causing the Debt Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing; and (v) comply with their applicable covenants and other obligations pursuant to the Financing Letters and the definitive documents relating to the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing Date.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice in writing (but in any event within two Business Days after the occurrence or discovery of) (A) of any material breach (or threatened material breach), material default, cancellation, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or threatened breach, default, cancellation, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or such definitive agreements; or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing; (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing such that Parent and Merger Sub would not have the Required Funds (after taking into account funds otherwise available from internally generated cash flow); and (D) of the occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to materially adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent; provided that none of Parent or Merger Sub shall be required to disclose or provide any such information, the disclosure of which, in the judgement of Parent upon advice of outside counsel, is subject to attorney client privilege or which would be in violation of any confidentiality obligation.   52

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, or Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable, on the terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions in any Fee Letter) contemplated in the Financing Letters such that Parent and Merger Sub would not have the Required Funds (after taking into account funds otherwise available from internally generated cash flow), then Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company in writing (but in any event within two Business Days after the discovery thereof) and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) arrange and obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Sub to have the Required Funds, (A) on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Financing Letters, (B) containing conditions to draw, conditions to closing and other terms that would reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof that (1) are not more onerous than those conditions and terms contained in the Financing Letters, (2) would not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing or make the Closing materially less likely to occur, and (3) in an amount at least sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Sub to have the Required Funds (the “Alternate Debt Financing”); and (ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the “New Debt Commitment Letters”), which new letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent shall promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith or other agreements related thereto) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing Letters” or the “Debt Commitment Letters” will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Financing” means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing. 


(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 5.14 shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby whether or not the Debt Financing is available, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Closing. If the Debt Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, to consummate the Merger. 


(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Affiliates to commence any suit, claim or similar proceeding with respect to or in order to enforce Parent’s rights under the Debt Commitment Letter.   53

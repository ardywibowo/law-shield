ARTICLE III 




CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 




SECTION 3.01      Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 




( a )         Conversion of Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Share” and collectively, the “Shares”), other than any Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall be converted automatically solely into the right to receive $26.00 in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding in accordance with Section 3.07 (the “Merger Consideration”). The Merger Consideration is payable in accordance with Section 3.02(b). 




( b )         Cancellation of Excluded Shares. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 




(c )         Shares of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company. 




SECTION 3.02      Exchange of Certificates. 




  14       ( a )         Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the purpose of effecting payments to the holders of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to each of the Company and Parent, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. Prior to, or substantially concurrently with, the Effective Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated the highest quality by either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available), or a combination of the foregoing. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Company. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, such that the Payment Fund diminishes below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 




(b )         Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates formerly evidencing such Shares (each, a “Certificate” and, together, the “Certificates”) or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss and delivery of an indemnity bond reasonable in amount, if reasonably requested by Parent, in lieu thereof pursuant to Section 3.02(e)) to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto (and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent), the former holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(a), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book- Entry Share so surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing such Shares shall be presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 




  15       Until properly surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled pursuant to this Article III. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article III. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.02, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an “agent’s” message in customary form (or such other
















________________




evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent or Parent may reasonably require) be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such agent’s message (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent or Parent may reasonably require), the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share. 




( c )         No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as provided herein or by Law. 




(d )         Termination of Payment Fund . Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for, and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of the earlier of (i) the fifth (5 th) anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 




( e )         Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if reasonably required by the Surviving Company, an indemnity bond reasonable in amount, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a). 




  16       SECTION 3.03      Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

( a )         At the Effective Time, (i) each restricted stock unit subject only to service-based vesting restrictions (each, a “Restricted Stock Unit”) granted under the Company Stock Plans and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested (to the extent unvested) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, subject to the payment pursuant to Section 3.04(b), (ii) each restricted stock unit subject, in whole or in part, to performance-based vesting restrictions (each a “Performance Stock Unit”) granted under the Company Stock Plans and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time as to the greater of the number of Performance Stock Units that would vest based on (x) target performance level as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (y) actual performance through the date immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, in each case, shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, subject to the payment pursuant to Section 3.04(b) and (iii) each deferred stock unit (each a “Deferred Stock Unit”, and together with the Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units, a “Stock Unit”) granted under the Company Stock Plans and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested (to the extent unvested) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, subject to the payment pursuant to Section 3.04(b). 




(b )         Each Stock Unit shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive, immediately after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) days following the Effective Time), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Stock Unit (determined in accordance with Section 3.04(a)). All such payments shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements. 




( c )         Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that: (i) with respect to any Offering Period(s) (as such term is defined in the Company ESPP) in progress as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Offering Period(s) shall terminate and any option to purchase Shares under the Company ESPP shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is no later than two Business Days prior to the Effective Time or (B) the date on which such Offering Period(s) would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period(s) shall commence under such Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the amount of his, her or its rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; 




  17       (iii) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (iv) the amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP be refunded to such participant as of the Effective Time; and (v) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. 




( d )         Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, as applicable, provide any notice required under the terms of the Company Stock Plans, obtain any necessary consents, adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the Company Stock Plans or any outstanding awards and take all other appropriate actions to give effect to the Transactions. The Company shall provide Parent with documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions in clauses (a), (b), (c), and (d) (provided that the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on, and the Company shall consider such comments in good faith for incorporation into, such documentation) no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time. 




(e)         Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of Shares or other equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each person who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as amended.

________________




SECTION 3.06      Dissenting Shares. 




( a )         Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding and automatically will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by applicable Laws, each holder of Dissenting Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares, other than such rights as are granted under such Section 262. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding in accordance with Section 3.07, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.02, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. 




  18       ( b )         The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt (and in any event, within one (1) Business Day of receipt by the Company) notice and copies of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct and control (or, if Parent elects not to so direct and control, the right to participate (but not appear on the record) in, and be kept reasonably apprised by the Company of all material developments with respect to) all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment, or offer or agree to make any payment, with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

( a )         Parent has received and accepted (i) an executed equity commitment letter dated February 16, 2021 (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) from New Mountain Partners VI, L.P. (the “Equity Investor”), pursuant to which the Equity Investor has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the amount set forth therein (the “Equity Financing”) and (ii) an executed commitment letter dated February 16, 2021 from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”) pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide the debt financing in the amounts set forth therein at the Effective Time (the “Debt Financing”) for the purpose of funding the Transactions and the related fees and expenses thereto, together with any fee letters related thereto (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, and the redacted executed fee letters associated therewith, collectively, the “Debt Commitment Letter” and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the “Commitment Letters”). The Equity Commitment Letter expressly provides that the Company is a third-party beneficiary thereof, and the Company is entitled to enforce, directly or indirectly, the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms. The Debt Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Financing pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Financing.” Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters and any fee letters related thereto (with any fee letters related to the Debt Financing being subject to customary redactions of fee amounts, pricing caps and “market flex”) (the “Fee Letter”).

Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, as of the date hereof Parent and Merger Sub do not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Merger Sub at the Effective Time. 




( c )         Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters, shall provide Merger Sub with cash proceeds at the Effective Time (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges under the Commitment Letters and any fee letters related thereto) sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, any prepayment, repayment, refinancing or conversion of debt contemplated by this Agreement, any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts payable pursuant to Article III) and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions and the Financing, in each case, payable on the Closing Date (collectively, the “Required Amount”).

As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 8.02(a), no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would or, would reasonably be expected to, (x) constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters or (y) result in any portion of the Financing being unavailable or materially delayed at the Effective Time or on the Closing Date. Parent or Merger Sub has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, none of the Commitment Letters have been modified, amended or altered, and none of the commitments under any of the Commitment Letters have been withdrawn, terminated, amended, modified or rescinded in any respect. There are no other fee letters, engagement letters, side letters or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing other than fee letters that relate only to structuring, arranging or other similar fees. 




( e )         Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any other financing or other transaction or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations hereunder. 




SECTION 5.09      Parent Guarantee. Parent has furnished the Company with a true, complete and correct copy of a guarantee by the Equity Investor in favor of the Company (the “Parent Guarantee”), which provides a guarantee of Parent’s obligations as set forth, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained, therein.

The Parent Guarantee has not been amended or modified (and no waiver of any provision thereof has been granted), and the obligations and commitments contained in the Parent Guarantee have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and no event has occurred that would result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Parent Guarantee.

  45       SECTION 5.10      Solvency. Immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions (including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and all other Required Amounts) and assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties contained in Article IV, the Surviving Company on a consolidated basis will be Solvent as of the Effective Time, as of the Closing Date and immediately after the Effective Time.

Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that, except for the representations and warranties set forth in Article IV, none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor any of their respective shareholders or Representatives, nor any other person, has made or is making any warranty with respect to any matter, including any such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans). 




  46       Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that they have not relied on any information provided by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives, including information in any “data room”, management presentations or any estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans received from the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or their Representatives.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 




SECTION 7.01      Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders’ Meeting. 




(a)         As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company, with the reasonable and customary assistance of Parent, shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, and each covenants that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with the SEC or first mailed to the Company’s stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. The Company shall promptly (and in any event, within one (1) Business Day of receipt) notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating to holders of Shares and reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional information. The Company shall consider in good faith any comments made by Parent and/or its counsel. If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 




  51       ( b )         Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01, the Company shall (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders’ Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if on a date for which the Company Stockholders’ Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall, after consultation with Parent, have the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting; provided, that in no event shall the Company postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders’ Meeting to a date that is later than the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the Outside Date without Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless otherwise required by Law. The Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and, unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms hereof, the Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and related matters (including any “golden parachute” vote) shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.

(a )         Except (i) as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any Contract or (ii) as would be reasonably expected to result in the loss of any attorney-client, attorney work product, or other legal privilege (provided, that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the disclosure of such information (or as much of it as reasonably possible) in a manner that does not, in the case of clause (i), result in a violation of Law or the terms of any Contract, or, in the case of clause (ii), result in a loss of attorney-client attorney work product or other legal privilege), during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, at Parent’s expense: (x) provide to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company by Parent, to the officers, employees, properties and offices and other facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the material books and records thereof, and (y) furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities and personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request.

SECTION 7.03      No Solicitation. 




(a )         The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct (and use its reasonable best efforts to cause) its and the Company Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussions or negotiations that may be ongoing with a potential acquiror or its Representatives with respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly

  53       (b)         Except as permitted by this Section 7.03, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company agrees that neither it nor any Company Subsidiary shall, and it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and the Company Subsidiaries’ Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to, or the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such person of the existence of this Section 7.03(b) or (iii) except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent or understanding or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal or that would require the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger (each, an “Acquisition Agreement”); provided, that, if, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Agreement and the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives may (A) engage in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (B) furnish information to the person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. 




(c )         The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected to result in, any Acquisition Proposal, notify Parent of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer or proposal received by the Company (including copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements), and the identity of the person or “group” making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry offer or proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the status and terms of, and changes in, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer or proposal (including copies of any written requests, proposals, offers or agreements related thereto) and (ii) make available to Parent copies of all written due diligence materials concerning the Company provided by the Company to such party to the extent not previously provided or made available to Parent. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours), following a determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such determination. 




( d )         Except as permitted by this Section 7.03, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not, and shall not publicly propose to: (i) withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation; (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or declare the advisability of, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (iv) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer that is subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal offer; 




  54       or (v) if an Acquisition Proposal other than a tender offer or exchange offer that is subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act shall have been publicly announced or disclosed, fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation upon the written request of Parent within five (5) Business Days after such written request; provided, that Parent may only make one such reaffirmation request with respect to each such public announcement or disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal so long as the Company reaffirmed the Company Board Recommendation in response to such request and such Acquisition Proposal has not been subsequently amended or modified (any of the foregoing actions, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”). 




( e )         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval but subject to compliance with Section 7.03(a), if in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not been withdrawn and that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.03, the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such action would, or would be reasonably likely to, violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then (i) the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (ii) the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(ii) in order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(ii) unless the Company (A) prior to, or concurrently with, such termination, pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee and (B) concurrently with such termination, enters into a definitive agreement that documents the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal. 




( f )         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, but subject to the Company’s and the Company Board’s compliance with Section 7.03(h), the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would, or would be reasonably likely to, violate of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 




( g )         Prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(ii) in order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, (i) the Company shall notify Parent in writing that it intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(ii), as applicable, (ii) the Company shall provide Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the person or “group” making the Superior Proposal) and an unredacted copy of the Acquisition Agreement, (iii) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of three (3) Business Days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall discuss and negotiate in good faith, and shall make its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and Parent’s Representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iv) no earlier than the end of such three (3)-Business Day period, the Company Board shall determine, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such three (3)-Business Day period and in consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any changes to the financial or other material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to the first such subsequent notice, references herein to the “three (3) Business Day” period shall be deemed a “two (2)-Business Day” period, and with respect to each subsequent notice thereafter, such references shall be deemed to be a “one (1)-Business Day” period.

For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or such statement is a “stop, look and listen” communication.

( a )         From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under all indemnification agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any of their respective present or former directors and officers (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”). In addition, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set forth in the Company Charter or the Company By-laws on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 




(b )         For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any Action (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries, whether occurring on or before the Effective Time. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any such Action, subject to receipt of an undertaking (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Company) to repay such advances if it is

ultimately determined in accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such Action, (i) the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one (1) counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, promptly after statements therefor are received, (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto in writing, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, that in the event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 7.04(b) shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 




  58       ( c )         Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain “tail” insurance policies with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof for the six (6) year period following the Effective Time at a price not to exceed 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid for such insurance in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement. If the Company does not obtain “tail” insurance prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the Effective Time “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company’s existing policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, if available, the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company; provided, that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.04(c) more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; provided further that in the event of an expiration, termination or cancellation of such current policies, Parent or the Surviving Company shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for amounts not to exceed such maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums. 




( d )         In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04. 




( e )         The provisions of this Section 7.04 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and legal representatives, each of whom shall be a third party beneficiary under this Agreement. 




(f)         Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Company under this Section 7.04. 




SECTION 7.05      Employee Benefits Matters. 




( a )         Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of eighteen (18) months immediately following the Effective Time or if earlier, the applicable Covered Employee’s period of employment, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to: (i) provide each “Covered Employee” (which is defined as each employee of the Company and of each of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time other than an employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with a Union, which shall continue to apply) with at least the same level of base salary and annual target cash incentive compensation opportunity that was provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with other employee benefits (excluding (x) any equity, equity-based, long-term incentive, change-in-control, retention benefit, and nonqualified deferred compensation, 




  59       (y) defined benefit or (z) post-retirement or retiree medical or health and welfare benefits (the “Excluded Benefits”)) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Covered Employee and their covered dependents immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor, pay, perform and satisfy any and all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to, or in respect of, each Covered Employee arising under the terms of any Plan that is an employment, retention, severance, change-in-control or similar agreement, in accordance with the terms thereof in effect on the Closing. 




(b)         Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to credit Covered Employees for all service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any employee benefit plan (excluding the Excluded Benefits) of Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of their Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and eligibility to receive benefits (but not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement medical or other similar benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries under which any Covered Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each Covered Employee’s vacation and sick time accruals, as of the Effective Time, shall carry over to Parent, Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, provided, that such accruals have been paid or properly recorded as a liability on the books of the relevant entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.05 shall be construed to require crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits for the same period of service or (ii) service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan or any grandfathered or frozen Parent benefit plan. 




(c)         With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Company (“Parent Welfare Benefit Plans”) in which a Covered Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, subject to the terms of the applicable Parent Welfare Benefit Plan, (i) waive, or cause the insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Covered Employee and any covered dependent under any Parent Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Plan, and (ii) provide credit to each Covered Employee and any covered dependent for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Covered Employee or covered dependent under the Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and including the Effective Time. 




( d )         The provisions contained in this Section 7.05 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing in this Section 7.05, whether express or implied, shall (i) create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any other person, including any current or former employee, officer,
















________________




director, independent contractor or other individual service provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any participant in any Plan or other benefit plan or arrangement, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.05, 




  60       (ii) create any right to employment or service, continued employment or service or any term or condition of employment or service with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (iii) be treated as an adoption of, termination of, an amendment, waiver or other modification of any Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement or (iv) limit in any way the right of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement at any time in accordance with its terms. 




SECTION 7.06      Further Action. 




( a )         Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain all authorizations, consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits and waivers of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and (ii) provide such other information to any Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority may lawfully request in connection herewith. Each party shall make its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days, following the date of this Agreement. In addition, each Party agrees to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably practicable and use its reasonable best efforts to make as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (or such other date as may be required by the applicable Antitrust Law) any other filings and notifications pursuant to any other Antitrust Law with respect to the Transactions. The parties shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be requested related to the Transactions. Parent will pay all fees or make other payments to any Governmental Authority in order to make such filings or obtain any such authorizations, consents, Orders or approvals. 




( b )         Without limiting the generality of the undertaking of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section 7.06(a), Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of such of its and their assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant hereto, and entering into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the Transactions. 




  61       In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall defend any Action in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions or which would prevent the consummation of the Merger prior to the Outside Date. 




( c )         Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating thereto and (ii) keep each other reasonably apprised of the content and status of any material communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other parties hereto of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to any review or investigation of the Transactions under the HSR Act, and shall permit the other parties to review in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other party in relation to) any proposed material communication by such party to any Governmental Authority relating to such matters. None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any submissions, filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other parties a reasonable amount of time in advance and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The parties to this Agreement shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions; provided, however, that each party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other party as “Outside Counsel Only Material” and may redact the materials as necessary to (i) remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. 




( d )         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party shall be required, nor shall the Company (or any of the Company Subsidiaries) be permitted, to take or commit to take any action with respect to its assets, properties, business or operations in connection with obtaining the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under, or any approvals under, the HSR Act or any Authorization, unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing. 




(e)         None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates shall enter into any agreement, transaction or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that would reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult, or to materially increase the time required, to: 




  62       (i) consummate the Merger and the Closing, (ii) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals required under any other Antitrust Law applicable to the Transactions, (iii) avoid the entry of, avoid the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions or (iv) obtain all authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements, obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions necessary or advisable to cause Merger Sub to pay, perform and discharge its obligations hereunder. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall engage in any activity of any nature except as provided in or expressly contemplated by this Agreement. 




SECTION 7.08      Public Announcements. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of which has been agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except with respect to any matters contemplated by Section 7.03, Section 9.01 or Section 9.03, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, except to the extent public disclosure is required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of Nasdaq or any United States national securities exchange on which the Shares are then traded, in which case the issuing party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any press release or making any such public statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may, without such consultation, make any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC, so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties hereto (or individually in accordance with this Section 7.08) . Prior to making any material written communications to the employees or independent contractors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Transactions, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication at least one (1) Business Day prior to dissemination prior to the date of first use, and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments made to such communication (it being understood that any subsequent communication that sets forth substantially the same information shall not require compliance with this sentence). 




SECTION 7.09      Transfer Taxes . The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of Parent and the Surviving Company agrees to assume liability for and pay any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer and any similar Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording, registration and other fees that may be imposed upon, payable or incurred by the Company and Company Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. 




  63       SECTION 7.10      Stock Exchange De-Listing. Parent shall cause the Company’s securities to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to accomplish the foregoing. 




SECTION 7.11      Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the commencement of, any stockholder litigation brought or threatened in writing against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions (“Transaction Litigation”) and shall promptly advise Parent of any material developments with respect to and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall be entitled to direct and control the defense of any such stockholder litigation; provided, however, the Company shall give Parent the right to consult and participate in the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to Parent’s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall not and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, settle any Transaction Litigation without Parent’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 




SECTION 7.12      Takeover Laws . If any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “interested shareholder” or other anti- takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, then the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such Law or Laws inapplicable to the foregoing. 




SECTION 7.13      Certain Filings and Consents. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and (iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Proxy Statement and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. The Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to obtain consents and waivers with respect to Contracts to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party (which may or may not be obtained); provided, that (A) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries will make or agree to make any payment of a consent fee, “profit sharing” payment or other consideration (including increased or accelerated payments) or concede anything of monetary or economic value for the purposes of obtaining any such consents without the prior consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and (B) no failure to obtain any such consent or waiver or any Contract termination as a result of such failure shall result in the failure of any condition set forth in Article VIII. 




  64       SECTION 7.14      Financing. 




(a)         Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing at or prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiating, as promptly as practicable, definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing to be entered into at or prior to the Effective Time (the “Definitive Financing Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, agreeing to any requested changes to the commitments thereunder in accordance with any “flex” provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter), in each case which terms shall not in any respect expand on the conditions to the funding of the proceeds from the Debt Financing at or prior to the Effective Time or reduce the aggregate amount of the proceeds from the Debt Financing available to be funded at or prior to the Effective Time below the Required Amounts, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements applicable to Parent or Merger Sub and their Affiliates to obtain the Financing and (iv) borrowing an amount necessary in accordance with the terms of the Definitive Financing Agreements to consummate the Transactions. In the event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied), Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders, and shall cause the Equity Investors, to fund at or prior to the Effective Time the Financing required to consummate the Transactions and to pay related fees and expenses at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to comply with their respective obligations. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (A) permit any amendment, assignment, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, restate, substitute or replace, the Commitment Letters if such amendment, assignment, supplement, modification, waiver, restatement, substitution or replacement (1)
















________________




would (x) adversely and materially impact the ability of either Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their respective rights against any other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements relative to the ability of Merger Sub to enforce its rights against any of such other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof, (y) add new (or expand any existing) conditions to the receipt of the Financing or otherwise adversely affect (including with respect to timing) the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Merger at the Closing or any of the Transactions, or (z) be reasonably expected to make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur, (2) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing or (3) would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions; provided, that Parent or Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement or (B) take or fail to take any action or enter into any transaction that would reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters. Upon any such permitted amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 7.14(a), the terms “Debt Commitment Letter” and “Debt Financing” shall refer to the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced and the debt financing contemplated thereby. 




  65       (b)         In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent and Merger Sub will (i) use their respective best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative financing (as applicable, in an amount sufficient to replace such unavailable Debt Financing and in any event in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions) from the same or other sources and on terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than such unavailable Debt Financing (including giving full effect to the “flex” provisions contained in any related fee letter) and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt or equity financing, as applicable, that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing and which do not include any additional conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt or equity financing, as applicable, that are not conditions in the applicable Financing, with it being understood and agreed that if Parent and Merger Sub proceed with any alternative financing, Parent and Merger Sub shall be subject to the same obligations with respect to such alternative financing as set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing, and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms “Debt Commitment Letter” shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter, remaining in effect at the time in question). Upon the Company’s request, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company informed, in all reasonable detail, of the status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with prompt written notice (i) of (A) any material breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware (any breach or default in timely funding any commitment is agreed to be “material”), (B) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Lender, or other financing source with respect to any actual or threatened breach, default (or accusation of breach or default), termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements of any provision thereof, or (C) any material dispute or disagreement between or among Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Lenders, on the other hand, or among any Lenders to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund any of the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Effective Time, and (ii) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements. Notwithstanding (i) the foregoing compliance, by Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 7.14 shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations to consummate the Transactions whether or not the Financing is available and (ii) anything to the contrary herein, Parent shall have no obligation to disclose any information pursuant to this Agreement that is subject to attorney- client or similar legal privilege. 




(c )         Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, provide such reasonable cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, including: (i) upon reasonable notice, participating in a reasonable number of lender meetings, presentations, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, in each case, to the extent reasonable and customary, in connection with the marketing of the Financing; (ii) solely to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter, using reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral, effective no earlier than, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Closing;

SECTION 10.03      Interpretation and Rules of Construction. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Annex, an Exhibit, an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Annex, an Exhibit, an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof”, “hereto”, “hereby”, “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Documents, materials and information are deemed to have been “made available” to Parent and Merger Sub, if complete and accurate copies of such documents, materials or information (together with all amendments, modifications, supplements, schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto) were prior to the date hereof (a) available for review by such person and its Representatives through the electronic data room entitled Project Carter, which is hosted by Intralinks in connection with the Transactions, (b) disclosed in a SEC Document filed and publicly available, or (c) otherwise actually provided by or on behalf of the Company in writing to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives. The term “or” is not exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if.” The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Contract or Law defined or referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated, and any Law referred to herein shall be deemed to also refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. All accounting terms used and not defined herein have the respective meanings given to them under GAAP, except to the extent otherwise specifically indicated or that the context otherwise requires. 




  77       References to “ordinary course of business” refers to the ordinary course of business of the applicable person consistent with past practice (including with respect to quantity and frequency). References to a person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. If the last day of a period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the immediately following Business Day. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to “dollars” and “$” will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of America. Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. References to “days” shall mean “calendar days” unless expressly stated otherwise. Whenever this Agreement requires a Company Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Company Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action. All references herein to “parties” shall be to the parties hereto unless the context shall otherwise require. 




SECTION 10.04      Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 




SECTION 10.05      Entire Agreement. This Agreement, taken together with the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement (together with any joinders or other agreements entered into in connection therewith), the Equity Commitment Letter and the Parent Guarantee, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 




SECTION 10.06      Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the parties’ respective rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, that Parent and Merger Sub may (a) assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent and (b) pledge this Agreement to any lender of Parent as security for the obligation of such lender in respect of providing the Financing, provided, that, in each case, (i) no such assignment or pledge will in any way affect Parent’s obligations or liabilities under this Agreement and Parent shall continue to remain liable for all such obligations and liabilities and (ii) such assignment would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  




  78       No assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 




SECTION 10.07      Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except for (a) the provisions of Section 7.04 (which are for the benefit of

the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons after the Effective Time), (b) after the Effective Time occurs, the rights of the holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (c) the rights, at and after the Effective Time, of the holders of the Stock Units to receive the payments contemplated by Section 3.04, (d) the right of the Company to seek, prove and be awarded damages (including damages based on loss of the economic benefit of the Transactions to the Company’s stockholders) on behalf of the Company’s stockholders, (e) the rights of the Non-Recourse Parties set forth in Section 10.14, and (f) the provisions of Section 9.03(c), Section 10.06, this Section 10.07, the last sentence of Section 10.09(b), the first sentence of Section 10.10, Section 10.11 and Section 10.16, each of which shall be enforceable by each Financing Source as an intended third party beneficiary thereof. 




SECTION 10.08      Specific Performance. 




(a)         The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Parent Guarantee, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in Law, equity or otherwise, including monetary damages) to (i) an Order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where Parent, Merger Sub or the Company is obligated to consummate any Transaction and such Transaction has not been consummated, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that the other party and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party and its stockholders and that such other party on behalf of itself and its stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parent’s and Merger Sub’s or the Company’s, as the case may be, obligation to consummate such Transaction and the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and the Parent Guarantee (and specifically that the Company is entitled to enforce the Equity Investor’s obligation to provide the Equity Commitment (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise), the Equity Investor’s obligations pursuant to the Parent Guarantee or otherwise cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions on behalf of itself and its stockholders, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub). Each party further agrees that no other party or any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10.08, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. 




  79       Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to or awarded a grant of specific performance which results in the consummation of the Merger, on the one hand, and be entitled to or receive the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand and (y) the Company shall only be permitted to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement as set forth in, and subject to the provisions and limitations of, Section 10.08(b). 




(b)         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of the Company to seek specific performance in order to force Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Closing shall be available if (and only if) each of the following shall have been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 (other than such conditions which, by their nature or terms, are to be satisfied by the delivery of documents or the taking of actions at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied if the Closing would have occurred on such date) have been satisfied as of the Closing Date if the Closing would have occurred pursuant to the terms of the Agreement (including Article II), (ii) the Company has delivered to Parent a Closing Failure Notice, (iii) the Debt Financing (or any alternative Debt Financing) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur on the terms contemplated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be entitled to seek to enforce specifically Parent and/or Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing).   SECTION 10.09      Governing Law. 




(a)         This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the principles of conflicts of law that would cause the application of law of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware. 




(b)         The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that, if such court does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the State of Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by either party hereto; (ii) agrees that service of process will be validly effected by sending notice in accordance with Section 10.02; and (iii) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above named courts. 




  80       Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto, including on behalf of their respective Affiliates, (A) agrees that (1) any action or proceeding, whether at Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York and any appellate court thereof and (2) any such action or proceeding shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in the application of the laws of any other State, (B) submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (C) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section 10.02 shall be effective service of process against it for any such action brought in any such court, (D) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (E) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. 




SECTION 10.10      Waiver of Jury Trial . EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, SUIT OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE). EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
















________________




HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.10. 




SECTION 10.11      Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, by written agreement of the parties hereto, at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that following the Effective Time, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change the form of the Merger Consideration or that would otherwise require the approval of the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of Section 9.03(c), this Section 10.11, Section 10.07, Section 10.06, the last sentence of Section 10.09(b), and the first sentence of Section 10.10, Section 10.16 (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the substance of such Sections) shall not be amended, modified, supplemented or waived in a manner that adversely impacts or is otherwise adverse in any respect to any Financing Source without the prior written consent of the applicable Financing Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter. 




  81       SECTION 10.12      Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 




SECTION 10.13      Company Disclosure Schedule. The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule to which such information reasonably relates in a manner that is reasonably apparent on its face as though fully set forth in such other Section. Certain items and matters may be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule for informational purposes only and may not be required to be listed therein by the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the listing of items or matters in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty (a) shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material event, circumstance, change, effect, development or condition or that such item would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (b) shall not be construed as an admission or indication by the Company of any non-compliance with, or breach or violation of, any third party rights (including any Intellectual Property), any Contract or agreement or any Law or Order of any Governmental Authority, such disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of creating exceptions to the representations made herein or of disclosing any information required to be disclosed under this Agreement. 




SECTION 10.14      Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party, except for claims that the Company may assert in accordance with the Parent Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Confidentiality Agreement, in each case, to the extent set forth, and subject to the limitations, therein. Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Parent Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Confidentiality Agreement, no former, current or future officers, employees, directors, partners, equity holders, managers, members, attorneys, agents, advisors or other Representatives of any party hereto (each, a “Non-Recourse Party” ) shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim or proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of or by reason of the Transactions or in respect of any written or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no recourse under this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein or in connection with any Transactions shall be sought or had against any Non-Recourse Party, except for claims that any party may assert against (A) another party solely in accordance with, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement or (B) pursuant to the Parent Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Confidentiality Agreement. 




  82       SECTION 10.15      Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic transmission, such as by electronic mail in “pdf” form) in counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 




SECTION 10.16      Non-Recourse Against Financing Sources; Waiver of Certain Claims . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree that, subject to the rights of Parent and Merger Sub under the Debt Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Debt Financing, (a) no Financing Source shall have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates or stockholders or any other Person relating to or arising out of the Merger, this Agreement, the Transactions or the Debt Financing, or any transactions contemplated by, or document related to, the foregoing (including any willful breach thereof, or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated), whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (b) none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or stockholders shall have any rights or claims whatsoever against any of the Financing Sources under this Agreement, the Transactions or in connection with the Debt Financing, or otherwise in respect of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by any of the foregoing, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

The Merger Consideration is payable in accordance with Section 3.02(b).”         (b)       Section 7.03(j)(iii) of the Original Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as set forth immediately below: ““Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that (A) did not result from or in connection with a breach by the Company of this Section 7.03 and (B) is on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) and after taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory, financing and other aspects (including the identity of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal and the conditionality and timing of such proposal) of such Acquisition Proposal, (I) if consummated would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company’s stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the Merger and the Transactions (taking into account, in each case, any proposed amendment or modification proposed by Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(g)) , (II) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms on a timely basis (taking into account (1) the anticipated timing to consummate the Transactions and (2) all legal, financial, regulatory, financing and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal) and (III) is not subject to any “due diligence” or financing contingencies.

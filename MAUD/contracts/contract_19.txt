  ARTICLE II   TREATMENT OF SECURITIES   Section 2.1             Treatment of Capital Stock.   (a)            Treatment of Company Common Stock. At the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Pre-Closing Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Pre-Closing Surviving Corporation. From and after the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time, all certificates representing Company Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Pre-Closing Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.   (b)            Treatment of Canyon Newco Common Stock. At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of any securities of Canyon Newco or of Crystal Merger Sub, subject to Section 2.1(f) and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Canyon Newco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than Canyon Newco Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(c) and other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the following consideration (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”): (i) $16.93 in cash, without interest (the “Per Share Cash Amount”) and (ii) an amount of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Share equal to the Exchange Ratio. From and after the First Effective Time, all such Canyon Newco Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Canyon Newco Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Canyon Newco Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, including the right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.6, cash in lieu of the right to otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Stock, if any (the “Fractional Share Consideration”), together with the amounts payable in accordance with Section 2.2(f).   (c)            Cancellation of Company Common Stock. At the First Effective Time, all Canyon Newco Shares then owned by any Company Subsidiary, Parent, US Holdco, Crystal Merger Sub or by any of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  (d)            Treatment of Crystal Merger Sub Membership Interests. At the First Effective Time, each issued and outstanding membership interest of Crystal Merger Sub (the “Crystal Merger Sub Membership Interests”) shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation. From and after the First Effective Time, all certificates representing Crystal Merger Sub Membership Interests shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.   (e)            Effect of Second Merger. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or holders of any securities of the First Surviving Corporation or of US Holdco, (i) each equity interest of US Holdco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as an equity interest of the Surviving Company and (ii) all shares of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist without any consideration being payable therefor, such that, immediately following the Second Merger, the Surviving Company shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.   (f)            Adjustment to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration, the Per Share Cash Amount, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock, Canyon Newco Shares or Parent Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Canyon Newco Shares or Parent Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the First Effective Time; provided that nothing in this Section 2.1(f) shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any of the foregoing actions with respect to its respective securities to the extent otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any convertible notes offering undertaken in connection with the Financing shall not result in any adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.1(f).

  Section 2.2             Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.   (a)            Exchange Fund. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent, US Holdco or Crystal Merger Sub shall designate a bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder services provider reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent in connection with the First Merger (the “Exchange Agent”). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Canyon Newco’s stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or prior to the First Effective Time, Parent, US Holdco or Crystal Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (b) in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Parent Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any amounts payable in accordance with Section 2.2(f) (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the “Exchange Fund”), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Canyon NewCo Common Stock. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any amounts payable in accordance with Section 2.2(f), Parent shall, or shall cause US Holdco or Crystal Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration, and any amounts payable in accordance with Section 2.2(f) out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however,  that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company on the earlier of (i) one (1) year after the First Effective Time or (ii) the full payment of all amounts required to be paid from the Exchange Fund.

  Section 4.5         Internal Controls and Procedures. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parent’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent’s internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parent’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ assets that would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial statements. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its board of directors (x) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for Parent’s auditors and audit committee of the Parent Board of Directors any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal control over financial reporting. From March 31, 2018 to the date of this Agreement, Parent has not received written notice from the SEC or any other Governmental Entity indicating that any of its accounting policies or practices are or may be the subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or challenge by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity.

Except (a) as disclosed, reflected or reserved against in Parent’s consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) as of September 30, 2020 included in the Parent SEC Documents, (b) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2020, (c) as expressly permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and (d) for liabilities which have been discharged or paid in full, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, other than those which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the First Merger.

The Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include all information reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly correct any information provided by it or any of its Representatives for use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus if and to the extent that such information is discovered by Company or Parent, as applicable, to be or to have become false or misleading in any material respect. For purposes of this Section 5.4, any information concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or the Company Special Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response). None of the Company, Parent or their respective Representatives shall agree to participate in any material or substantive meeting or conference (including by telephone) with the SEC, or any member of the staff thereof, in respect of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by the SEC, allows the other Party to participate. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Stock issuable in connection with the First Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or “blue sky” Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the Parent Stock in the First Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

  (b)            If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party, and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company and the shareholders of Parent.   (c)            The Company shall (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company Special Meeting, (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date on which the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents, duly call, give notice of, file and commence mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at, the Company Special Meeting and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 40 calendar days) following the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus pursuant to clause (ii) above, convene and hold the Company Special Meeting. The Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except in each case to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Change of Recommendation as permitted by Section 5.3. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all legal requirements applicable to the Company Special Meeting. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting; provided that the Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting (A) to (1) solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, or (2) distribute any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably necessary under applicable Law and for such supplement or amendment to be reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to the Company Special Meeting (provided, that no such postponement or adjournment under this clause (2) may be to a date that is after the 10th business day after the date of such distribution), (B) due to the absence of a quorum, or (C) if and to the extent such postponement or adjournment of the Company Special Meeting is required by an Order issued by any court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction in connection with this Agreement. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, postpone or adjourn the Company Special Meeting pursuant to clause (A)(1) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence for a period of more than 10 business days on any single occasion or, on any occasion, to a date after the earlier of (x) 30 business days after the date on which the Company Special Meeting was originally scheduled and (y) 10 business days before the Outside Date. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the matters contemplated by the Company Stockholder Approval shall be the only matters (other than matters of procedure and matters required by or advisable under applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection therewith) that the Company shall propose to be voted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Special Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Special Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the Company’s stockholders at the Company Special Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to affect such obligation. The Company agrees (i) to provide Parent and its Representatives with reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results upon Parent’s reasonable request and (ii) upon Parent’s request, to give written notice (which may be given via e-mail) to Parent one day prior to, and on the date of, the Company Special Meeting, indicating whether, as of such date, sufficient proxies representing the Company Stockholder Approval have been obtained.

The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in Article VII or give rise to any right to terminate under Article VIII.

(a)            Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Mergers and the other Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing, in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained by such Party from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Mergers or any of the other Transactions and (ii) using their reasonable best efforts to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals.

The Parties also agree that all rights to elimination or limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For six years after the Closing, the First Surviving Corporation shall also cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and (ii) any other agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination or limitation of liability, indemnification of officers, directors, employees, agents or other fiduciaries and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other Transactions). Parent shall also cause the Surviving Company to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the First Effective Time, the Company’s past and current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for any acts, omissions, or events occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) that is no less favorable than the Company’s existing policy or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Cap Amount”) and (ii) the Company may prior

to the First Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to D&O Insurance with an annual cost not in excess of the Cap Amount; provided, further, however , that, in each case, if the cost of such insurance exceeds the Cap Amount, then Parent shall or the Company may, as applicable, purchase as much coverage as is reasonably available for the Cap Amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the First Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.4, the provisions of this Section 6.4 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the First Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the First Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4. The rights and obligations under this Section 6.4 shall survive consummation of the Mergers and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.   




 66   




  Section 6.5          Takeover Statutes . The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Mergers and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Mergers and the other Transactions.

For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms “Debt Commitment Letter” and “Debt Financing Document” include the Debt Commitment Letter and any Debt Financing Document as the same may be amended, waived, modified or replaced pursuant to this Section 6.15(c).

 Section 9.14      Enforcement; Remedies.   (a)        Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.   (b)        The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to an Order of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.   (c)        The Parties’ rights in this Section 9.14 are an integral part of the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 9.14 (including any objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this Section 9.14, such Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy. The Parties acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence and that they would suffer ongoing irreparable injury for so long as any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms. It is accordingly agreed that, as to any legal proceeding in which a Party seeks specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this Section 9.14, the Parties shall seek and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain an expedited schedule for such proceedings and shall not oppose any Party’s request for expedited proceedings. The Parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.14, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement, including, subject to Section 8.2, monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has been terminated and (ii) nothing contained in this Agreement shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 9.14 before exercising any termination right under Article VIII (and, subject to Section 8.2, pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this Section 9.14 or anything contained in this Section 9.14 restrict or limit any Party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, although a Party may pursue a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief, payment of the Company Termination Fee or damages in the case of fraud or Willful Breach, under no circumstances shall Parent be permitted to receive more than one of the following: (A) a grant of specific performance that seeks and results in the consummation of the Mergers, (B) the payment of the Company Termination Fee or (C) damages.   Section 9.15      Liability of Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Company Related Party shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall have any liability or obligation to, or be subject to any action, suit, proceeding or claim from, any Company Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that nothing in this Section 9.15 shall in any way limit any Financing Source’s obligations to Parent under the Debt Commitment Letter; provided, further, that following consummation of the Mergers, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Financing under the Debt Financing Documents.

Amendments to the Agreement. The Parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows: a. Section 2.1(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated as follows: At the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time, (i) each share of Company Common Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of Canyon Newco Common Stock (which, after giving effect to the last sentence of this Section 2.1(a), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of Canyon Newco) and each such Company Share shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of each such Company Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable law and (ii) each share of common stock of Canyon Merger Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Pre-Closing Surviving Corporation (which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of the Pre-Closing Surviving Corporation). From and after the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time, (x) all certificates and uncertificated shares depicted by book entries representing Company Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to be Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, representing the same number of shares of Canyon Newco Common Stock that such certificates, and such book entries, represented of Company Common Stock immediately before the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time and (y) all certificates representing common stock of Canyon Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the same number of shares of common stock of the Pre-Closing Surviving Corporation that such certificates represented of common stock of Canyon Merger Sub immediately before the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time. At the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time, the Company shall cause all Canyon Newco Shares owned by the Company as of the Pre-Closing Effective Time to be conveyed to Canyon Newco or cancelled for no consideration. b. The third sentence in Section 2.2(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated as follows: At or prior to the First Effective Time, Parent, US Holdco or Crystal Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Parent Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any amounts payable in accordance with Section 2.2(f) (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the “Exchange Fund”), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Canyon Newco Common Stock. c. The second sentence in Section 2.2(c) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated as follows: From and after the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Pre-Closing Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.

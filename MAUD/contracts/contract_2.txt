(a)            Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Depository Agent”), for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.5(a)(iii). The Paying Agent Agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. Immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.5 (such deposits with the Depository Agent and with the Paying Agent, collectively, the “Payment Fund ”). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to deposit any funds related to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless and until such deposit is required pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer Price in the Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger; provided, however, the Payment Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; provided, further, that such investments shall be (1) in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, (2) in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or (3) in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, (i) no such investment will relieve Parent, Purchaser, or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Article 3 and (ii) no such investment will have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement.   (b)            Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.5(a)(iii), (1) in the case of holders of record of Certificated Shares, a form of letter of transmittal in reasonable and customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the “Certificates”) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal and (2) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, reasonable and customary provisions regarding delivery of an

“agent’s message” with respect to such Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with, in the case of Certificated Shares, such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book- Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book- Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled and of no further effect. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

  (c)            At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to the holders of Certificates or of Book-Entry Shares (including, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all Payment Funds), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or of Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all Encumbrances of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (d)            At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.

(e)            Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts (including any CVRs in respect of Shares) payable pursuant to this Agreement or the CVR Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options, Company RSU Awards or Company ESPP account balances such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold therefrom under applicable Tax Laws; provided, however, that except for payments to current or former employees of the Company with respect to Company Options and Company RSU Awards, before making any such deduction or withholding, Purchaser shall provide to the Company notice of any applicable payor’s intention to make such deduction or withholding, which notice shall include the authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding and shall provide at least a commercially reasonable period of time before such deduction or withholding is required in order for the applicable recipient to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding from the applicable Governmental Body or execute and deliver to or file with such Governmental Body or Purchaser such affidavits, certificates and other documents to afford reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted and withheld, each such payor shall take all action as may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, and such amounts so remitted shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  (f)            If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 3.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 3.   (g)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of uncertificated Shares held through the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.5(a)(iii).   (h)            Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and DTC with the objective that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first (1st) Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide each of the holders of Dissenting Shares with the second (2nd) notice contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.

(b)            Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Parent will pay or deliver the Non-Continuing Employee Severance Benefits to any such Non-Continuing Employee and the Transition Employee Severance Benefits to such Transition Employee as soon as reasonably practicable following the termination of such Non-Continuing Employee’s or such Transition Employee’s employment or other service arrangement.   (c)            For purposes of this Section 7.3(a), “Cause” means a Transition Employee’s (i) commission of any felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (ii) attempted commission of, or participation in, a fraud or act of dishonesty against the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) intentional, material violation of any agreement between the Transition Employee and the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or of any statutory duty owed to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) unauthorized use or disclosure of the Surviving Corporation’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ confidential information or trade secrets; (v) an act by the Transition Employee that constitutes gross negligence, willful misconduct or insubordination in the course of employment such employee’s employment or service with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; or (vi) the continued failure of the Transition Employee to perform the essential duties and responsibilities of such employee’s position, after having received notice of the deficiencies and having had thirty (30) days to cure such defects in performance.

  (d)            Without limiting the foregoing:   (i)            Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for all purposes, including for eligibility to participate, benefit levels (including, for the avoidance of doubt, levels of benefits under Parent’s or the Surviving Corporation’s vacation policy) and eligibility for vesting under Parent or the Surviving Corporation’s employee benefit plans and arrangements with respect to his or her length of service with the Company (and its predecessors) prior to the Closing Date, provided, that the foregoing shall not result in the duplication of benefits or to benefit accrual under any pension plan.   (ii)           With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of benefits), use commercially reasonable efforts to assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company.   (e)            To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any health or welfare benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which such employees participated prior to the Effective Time and (ii) ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-of- pocket maximums and allowances (including paid time off), credit Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent that such service and amounts paid was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by a Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year immediately before the Effective Time to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the applicable health or welfare benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.   (f)            The provisions of this Section 7.3 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 7.3 is intended to, or shall, be construed as providing any right to continued employment or service for any Person, or constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.   Section 7.4          Indemnification of Officers and Directors.   (a)            The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall provide for rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation in favor of those Persons who are directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Agreement Date or have been directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the past (the “Indemnified Persons”) for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (such provisions of the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, the “Indemnification Provisions”). The Indemnification Provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Persons, and shall be observed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns to the fullest extent available under Delaware Law for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and any claim made pursuant to such rights within such six (6)-year period shall continue to be subject to this Section 7.4(a) and the rights provided under this Section 7.4(a) until disposition of such claim.

Surviving Corporation (together with their successors and assigns, the “Indemnifying Parties”) shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws, advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.4(b), subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 7.4(b).   (c)            From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect, the current policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Agreement Date for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as directors and officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker approved by Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) purchase a six (6)-year “tail” policy for the existing policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if such “tail policy” has been obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain or maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 7.4(c); provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one (1) year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to such current policy, it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.

   (d)            In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent’s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.4.    (e)            The provisions of this Section 7.4 shall survive the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. This Section 7.4 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.    Section 7.5             Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any Legal Proceeding commenced against the Company or its directors relating to the Transactions. The Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with such litigation or existing litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to such litigation, and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into account. No such settlement of such litigation including existing litigation shall be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to the extent the settlement is fully covered by the Company’s insurance policies (other than any applicable deductible), but only if such settlement would not result in the imposition of any restriction on the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such Legal Proceeding.   Section 7.6             Further Assurances. Without limitation or contravention of the provisions of Section 7.2, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such Party pursuant to any Material Contract in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions, (b) seek each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any Material Contract by such Party in connection with the Transactions to the extent requested in writing by Parent and (c) seek to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions brought by any third party against such Party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party); (b) subject to any other applicable terms of this Agreement, the Company may make any disclosures, without Parent’s prior written consent (but with prior notice), in the Company SEC Documents as may be required by applicable federal securities Laws; (c) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be required by any applicable Law; and (d) the Company need not consult with Parent in connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing to be issued or made pursuant to Section 6.3(d) or with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

consummated an Acquisition Proposal (provided, that for purposes of this clause (z) the references to “a material portion” and “10% or more” in the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” shall be deemed to be references to “51% or more”);   then, in any such event under this Section 9.3(b), the Company shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designed in writing by Parent (A) in the case of Section 9.3(b)(i), substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement (it being agreed that if such termination occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, “substantially concurrently” shall mean no later than on the next Business Day), (B) in the case of Section 9.3(b)(ii), within two (2) Business Days after such termination or (C) in the case of Section 9.3(b)(iii), within two (2) Business Days after the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (z) above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, “ Termination Fee ” means a cash amount equal to $16,000,000. In the event that Parent or its designee shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 9.3(b), the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, “Parent Related Parties”) or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of its Representatives arising out of, relating to, or in connection with, this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.   


-63-  


  


  (c)            Parent’s right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) in any circumstance in which the Termination Fee becomes due and payable, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to, arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or Purchaser may seek specific performance to cause the Company to consummate the Transactions in accordance with Section 10.5(b) or the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(b), but in no event shall Parent or Purchaser be entitled to both (i) equitable relief ordering the Company to consummate the Transactions in accordance with Section 10.5(b) and (ii) the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(b).   (d)            Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each Party further acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions.   ARTICLE 10   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS   Section 10.1            Amendments. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, subject to Section 7.4(e), this Agreement may be amended only with the approval of the Company Board and the board of directors of Parent. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.    Section 10.2           Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

  Section 10.3           No Survival. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, will survive the Effective Time, except for (a) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms expressly apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time and (b) this Article 10.   Section 10.4           Entire Agreement; Counterparts.

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) in pdf, DocuSign or similar format and transmitted by facsimile or email shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.    Section 10.5           Applicable Laws; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies.   (a)            This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. In any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this

Section 10.5(a) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 10.8. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum (including, any claim based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens or any similar doctrine). The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

  (b)            The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 10.5(b), the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 10.5(a) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 9.3: (x) except with respect to monetary damages, are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (y) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent nor Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with the seeking of any such injunction or specific performance.

EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.    Section 10.6           Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall be void ab initio and of no effect.

  SECTION 8 – INDEMNIFICATION   (a)               Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings. The Corporation shall be liable to indemnify the current and former (for a period of six (6) years following the resignation or removal of such former officer or director) officers and directors of the Corporation (the “Indemnitees”) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant (as a witness or otherwise) in any Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 8, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, in the case of a criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful.   (b)              Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation shall be liable to indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant (as a witness or otherwise) in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 8, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection with such Proceeding (or any claim, issue or matter therein) if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; provided, however, that no indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 8 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable to the Corporation, unless and only to the extent that any court in which the Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification.   (c)               Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Bylaws, to the extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, the Corporation shall be liable to indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Corporation shall be liable to indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.   (d)              Indemnification For Expenses of a Witness. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee’s Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, the Corporation shall be liable to indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee’s behalf in connection therewith.   (e)               Additional Indemnification. Notwithstanding any limitation in this Section 8, the Corporation shall be liable to indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law if Indemnitee is a party to, or threatened to be made a party to, any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the Proceeding; provided, however, that no indemnity shall be made under this Section 8(e) on account of Indemnitee’s conduct which has been adjudicated to constitute a breach of Indemnitee’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders

or to constitute an act or omission not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law.   (f)                For purposes of Section 8(e), the meaning of the phrase “to the fullest extent permitted by law” shall include, but not be limited to:   i. to the fullest extent permitted by the provision of the DGCL that authorizes or contemplates additional indemnification by agreement, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL; and   ii. to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of these Bylaws that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors.   (g)              Exclusions. Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 8, the Corporation shall not be obligated to make any indemnity payment, or to advance any expenses, in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:   i. fo r which payment has actually been received by or on behalf of Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount actually received under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision;   ii. for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Corporation within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law; provided, however, that notwithstanding any limitation on the Corporation’s obligation to provide indemnification set forth in this Section 8(g) or elsewhere, Indemnitee shall be entitled to receive advancement of Expenses hereunder with respect to any such claim unless and until a court having jurisdiction over the claim shall have made a final judicial determination (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed) that Indemnitee has violated said statute; or   iii. in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Corporation or its directors, officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by applicable law, (ii) the Proceeding was authorized by the Board, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under the DGCL, or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to Section 8(n) of these Bylaws.

  (h)              Advancement of Expenses; Defense of Claim. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Corporation shall be obligated to advance any and all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding.  Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced to the extent and only to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Any advances (i) shall be unsecured and interest free; (ii) shall be made without regard to Indemnitee’s ability to repay the advances and without regard to Indemnitee’s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of these Bylaws; and (iii) shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Corporation to support the advances claimed. The Corporation will be entitled to participate reasonably in the Proceeding at its own expense.   (i)                Procedure for Notification and Requests for Advancement and Indemnification. To obtain advancement of Expenses and/or indemnification under these Bylaws, Indemnitee shall, not later than sixty (60) days after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding, except for Proceedings pending as of the date of these Bylaws, submit to the Corporation written notification of the Proceeding; with regard to Proceedings pending as of the date of these Bylaws, Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation written notification not later than thirty (30) days after the date of these Bylaws. The omission to notify the Corporation will relieve the Corporation of its advancement or indemnification obligations under these Bylaws only to the extent the Corporation can establish that such omission to notify resulted in actual prejudice to it, and the omission to notify the Corporation will, in any event, not relieve the Corporation from any liability which it may have to indemnify Indemnitee otherwise than under these Bylaws. The Secretary of the Corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of notification from Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 8(i), advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has provided such notification.   (j)                Expense Request. Subject to Section 8(h), to obtain advancement of Expenses under these Bylaws, Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request therefor, together with such invoices or other supporting information as may be reasonably requested by the Corporation and reasonably available to Indemnitee, and, only to the extent required by applicable law which cannot be waived, an unsecured written undertaking to repay amounts advanced. The Corporation shall make advance payment of Expenses to Indemnitee no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request for advancement (and each subsequent request for advancement) by Indemnitee. If, at the time of receipt of any such written request for advancement of Expenses, the Corporation has director and officer insurance policies in effect, the Corporation will promptly notify the relevant insurers in accordance with the procedures and requirements of such policies. The Corporation shall thereafter keep such director and officer insurers informed of the status of the Proceeding or other claim, as appropriate to secure insurance coverage of Indemnitee for such claim.   (k)              Indemnification Request. In order to obtain indemnification under these Bylaws, Indemnitee shall, anytime at Indemnitee’s discretion following notification by Indemnitee of the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to Section 8(l)(i) of these Bylaws, submit to the Corporation a written request for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8(k), including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. No determination of Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification shall be made until such written request for a determination is submitted by Indemnitee to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 8(k). The failure to submit a written request to the Corporation will relieve the Corporation of its indemnification obligations under these Bylaws only to the extent the Corporation can establish that such failure to make a written request resulted in actual prejudice to it, and the failure to make a written request will not relieve the Corporation from any liability which it may have to indemnify Indemnitee otherwise than under these Bylaws.  The Secretary of the Corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.  Upon submission of a written request for indemnification by Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 8(k), Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification shall be determined according to Section 8(l) of these Bylaws.

  (l)                Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.   i. Upon receipt of Indemnitee’s written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(k), a determination with respect thereto shall be made in the specific case by one of the following four methods, which shall be at the election of the Board:  (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, (ii) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, (iii) if there are no Disinterested Directors or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (iv) by the stockholders of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the above, if a determination with respect to Indemnitee’s right to indemnification is to be made following a Change of Control, such determination shall be made in the specific case by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee.  If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Disinterested Directors or Independent Counsel, as the case may be, making such determination shall be advanced and borne by the Corporation (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification) and the Corporation is liable to indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.   ii. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 8(l) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 8(l). The Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board and the Board shall provide written notice to the Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected.  Indemnitee may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been received, deliver to the Corporation a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of “Independent Counsel” as defined in Section 8(p) of these Bylaws, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion.  Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If a written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(l) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Corporation or Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Indemnitee to the Corporation’s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under this Section 8(l). Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 8(n) of these Bylaws, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing). The Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this Section 8(l), regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed.

  (m)              Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.   i. I n making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under these Bylaws if Indemnitee has submitted a notice and a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 8(k) of these Bylaws. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including by the Board) or of Independent Counsel to have made a determination prior to the commencement.   ii. I f the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 8(m) of these Bylaws to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of Indemnitee’s written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(k) of these Bylaws, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto.   iii.

Awards cancelled in connection with the Merger.   ( c )            Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 2.2, every request made to transfer the CVRs must be in writing and accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and other documentation reasonably requested by the Rights Agent in form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof, the Holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holder’s personal representative or the Holder’s survivor, as applicable, and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the provisions of Section 2.2), register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR Register and notify the Parent of the same. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer of a CVR, but Parent and the Rights Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other Tax or charge that is imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any action under any section of this Agreement that requires the payment of applicable Taxes or charges unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such Taxes or charges have been paid.

( d )            A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such Holder’s address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be duly executed by the Holder.

  ( b )            The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a Milestone Notice and cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the aggregate amount necessary to pay the applicable Milestone Payment Amount to all Holders pursuant to Section 4.2 as well as any letter of instruction reasonably required by the Rights Agent, send each Holder at its registered address a copy of such Milestone Notice. If a Milestone Payment is payable to the Holders, then at the time the Rights Agent sends a copy of the Milestone Notice to the Holders, the Rights Agent shall also pay the Milestone Payment Amount to each of the Holders in accordance with the corresponding letter of instruction (i) by check mailed to the address of such Holder reflected in the CVR Register as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date of the Milestone Notice or (ii) with respect to any such Holder that is due an amount in excess of $[100,000] in the aggregate who has provided the Rights Agent wiring instructions in writing as of the close of business on the date of the Milestone Notice, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified on such instructions.   (c)            Parent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold, or cause the Rights Agent to deduct or withhold, from any payments made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder, or any other applicable Tax Law, as may be determined by Parent and communicated to the Rights Agent in writing. Prior to making any such Tax withholdings or causing any such Tax withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder (other than ordinary course payroll withholding and reporting on the Covered Milestone Payments) Parent shall instruct the Rights Agent to solicit from such Holder an IRS Form W-9 or other applicable Tax form within a reasonable amount of time in order to provide the opportunity for the Holder to provide any necessary Tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form W-8) in order to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts. To the extent any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement and the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the Holder to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, Parent shall deliver (or shall cause the Rights Agent to deliver) to the Holder to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid an IRS Form 1099, an IRS Form W-2 or other reasonably acceptable evidence of such withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld from the Covered Milestone Payments, the Rights Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, deliver such amounts to Parent for the purposes of remitting such amounts to the IRS. In no event shall the Rights Agent have any duty, obligation or responsibility for wage or Form W-2 reporting with respect to Milestone Payments (including Covered Milestone Payments) made to the Holders.   ( d )            If any funds delivered to the Rights Agent for payment to Holders as Milestone Payment Amounts remain undistributed to the Holders on the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of the applicable Milestone Notice, Parent shall be entitled to require the Rights Agent to deliver to Parent or its designee any funds which had been made available to the Rights Agent in connection with such Milestone Payment Amounts and not disbursed to the Holders (including, all interest and other income received by the Rights Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such Holders shall be entitled to look to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as general unsecured creditors thereof with respect to the Milestone Payment Amounts that may be payable.   ( e )            Neither Parent, the Rights Agent nor any of their Affiliates shall be liable to any Holder for any Milestone Payment Amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws. If, despite Parent’s and the Rights Agent’s commercially reasonable efforts to deliver a Milestone Payment Amount to the applicable Holder, such Milestone Payment Amount has not been paid immediately prior to the date on which such Milestone Payment Amount would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body, such Milestone Payment Amount shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. In addition to and not in limitation of any other indemnity obligation herein, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Rights Agent with respect to any liability, penalty, cost or expense the Rights Agent may incur or be subject to in connection with transferring such property to Parent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, and may cause the Surviving Corporation to, report imputed interest on the CVRs and Milestone Payment Amounts pursuant to Section 483 of the Code.   2.5.           No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest.   (a)            The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest shall not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.   ( b )            The CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent or in any constituent company to the Merger or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.   ( c )            Neither Parent and its directors and officers nor Purchaser and its directors and officers will be deemed to have any fiduciary or similar duties to any Holders by virtue of this Agreement or the CVRs.   2.6.           Ability to Abandon CVR. A Holder may at any time, at such Holder’s option, abandon all of such Holder’s remaining rights in such Holder’s CVRs by transferring such CVRs to Parent or any of its Affiliates without consideration therefor, which a Holder may effect via delivery of a written abandonment notice to Parent. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from offering to acquire or acquiring any CVRs for consideration from the Holders, in private transactions or otherwise, in its sole discretion. Any CVRs acquired by Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be automatically deemed extinguished and no longer outstanding for purposes of the definition of Acting Holders and Article 5 and Article 6.   3.             THE RIGHTS AGENT   3 . 1 .           Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

If an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the Rights Agent shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a reasonably prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

If Parent fails to send such notice within ten (10) Business Days after acceptance of appointment by a successor Rights Agent, the successor Rights Agent shall cause the notice to be mailed at the expense of Parent.

  6.             REMEDIES OF THE HOLDERS   6.1.          Event of Default. An “Event of Default” with respect to the CVRs, means each one of the following events which shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of Law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any Governmental Body):   (a)            default in the payment by Parent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement of all or any part of the Milestone Payment Amount after a period of ten (10) Business Days after the Milestone Payment Amount shall become due and payable;   ( b )            material default in the performance, or breach in any material respect, of any covenant or warranty of Parent hereunder (other than a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section 6.1 specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of ninety (90) days after a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied is given, which written notice states that it is a “Notice of Default” hereunder and is sent by registered or certified mail to Parent by the Rights Agent or to Parent and the Rights Agent by the Acting Holders; or   (c)            the occurrence of a Specified Default.   Subject to Section 6.2, if an Event of Default described above occurs and is continuing (and has not been cured or waived), then, and in each and every such case, (i) the Rights Agent by notice in writing to Parent or (ii) the Rights Agent upon the written request of the Acting Holders by notice in writing to Parent (and to the Rights Agent if given by the Acting Holders), shall commence a legal proceeding to protect the rights of the Holders, including to obtain damages or payment for any amounts then due and payable.   The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.1, however, are subject to the condition that if, at any time after the Rights Agent shall have commenced such proceeding, and before any award shall have been obtained, Parent shall pay or shall deposit with the Rights Agent a sum sufficient to pay all amounts which shall have become due and such amount as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Rights Agent, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and all Events of Default under this Agreement shall have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided herein, then and in every such case the Acting Holders, by written notice to Parent and to the Rights Agent, may waive all defaults that are the subject of such proceeding, but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default.   6 . 2 .          Specified Defaults/Payment Due. In the event an Event of Default set forth in Section 6.1(c) occurs, then each Milestone that has not been attained shall be, without any further action by any Person, deemed to have been attained for all purposes under this Agreement.   6.3.          Enforcement. If an Event of Default has occurred, has not been waived and is continuing, the Rights Agent may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Agreement by commencing a legal proceeding in accordance with Section 7.6.   6 . 4 .          Limitations on Suits by Holders. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.4, no Holder of any CVR shall have any right under this Agreement to commence proceedings under or with respect to this Agreement, or for the appointment of a Rights Agent, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official, for any other remedy hereunder, unless (i) such Holder previously shall have given to the Rights Agent written notice of default, (ii) the Acting Holders shall have made written request upon the Rights Agent to commence such proceeding in its own name as Rights Agent hereunder and shall have offered to the Rights Agent such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby and (iii) the Rights Agent for fifteen (15) days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to commence any such proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Rights Agent pursuant to Section 6.5. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the right of any Holder of any CVR to receive payment of the amounts that a Milestone Notice indicates are payable in respect of such CVR on or after the applicable due date, or to commence proceedings for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such due date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

  6 . 5 .          Control by Acting Holders. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.5, the Acting Holders shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Rights Agent under this Agreement, or exercising any power conferred on the Rights Agent by this Agreement; provided that such direction shall not be otherwise than in accordance with Law and the provisions of this Agreement; provided, further that (subject to the provisions of Section 3.1) the Rights Agent shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Rights Agent, being advised by counsel, shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Rights Agent (acting in good

faith through its board of directors, the executive committee, or a committee of directors of the Rights Agent) shall determine that the action or proceedings so directed would involve the Rights Agent in personal liability or if the Rights Agent in good faith shall so determine that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interests of Holders not joining in the giving of said direction. Nothing in this Agreement shall impair the right of the Rights Agent in its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Rights Agent and which is not inconsistent with such direction or directions by the Acting Holders.   7.             OTHER PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATION   7 .1 .          Notices to the Rights Agent and Parent. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be delivered to Parent or the Rights Agent under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon receipt when delivered by hand, (b) two (2) Business Days after being sent by registered mail or by courier or express delivery service, (c) if sent by email transmission prior to 5:00 p.m. recipient’s local time, upon transmission thereof (provided that no bounceback or similar “undeliverable” message is received by such sender) or (d) if sent by email transmission after 5:00 p.m. recipient’s local time, the Business Day following the date of transmission (provided that no bounceback or similar “undeliverable” message is received by such sender); provided that in each case the notice or other communication is sent to the physical address or email address, as applicable, set forth beneath the name of such party below (or to such other physical address or email address as such party shall have specified in a written notice given to the other party):   If to the Rights Agent:   [●]   With a copy to:   [●]

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.   7 . 3 .          Parent Successors and Assigns. Parent may assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other Person, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder (i) to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent, (ii) to any purchaser, licensee or sublicensee of substantial rights to the Product that is a company in the pharmaceutical industry or (iii) otherwise with the prior written consent of the Acting Holders, to any other person (each, an “Assignee”); provided that the Assignee agrees to assume and be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional Assignees which agree to assume and be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that in connection with any assignment to an Assignee pursuant to clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 7.3 if the Assignee does not have net assets of at least $500,000,000 as shown on its most recently prepared financial statements, and clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 7.3, the assignor shall agree to remain liable for the performance by the Assignee of all duties, covenants, agreements and obligations of Parent hereunder, with such Assignee substituted for Parent under this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Parent’s successors and each Assignee. Subject to compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 7.3 relating to assignments, this Agreement shall not restrict Parent’s, any Assignee’s or any of their respective successors’ ability to merge or consolidate with, or sell, issue, license or dispose of its stock or other equity interests or assets to, any other Person, or spin-off or split-off. Each of Parent’s successors and each Assignee shall, by a supplemental contingent consideration payment agreement or other acknowledgement executed and delivered to the Rights Agent, expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the CVRs and the due and punctual performance of every duty, obligation, agreement and covenant of this Agreement on the part of Parent to be performed or observed by Parent. The Rights Agent may not assign this Agreement without Parent’s written consent. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any such rights in violation of this Section 7.3 shall be void and of no effect.

7.4.          No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall give to any Person (other than Parent’s successors and Assignees, each of whom is intended to be, and is, a third party beneficiary hereunder; provided that the Holders shall be considered third party beneficiaries solely to the extent set forth in Article 6) any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement or under any covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the sole benefit of the Rights Agent, Parent, Parent’s successors and Assignees, and the Holders (solely to the extent set forth in Article 6). The Holders shall have no rights except the contractual rights as are expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Holder may at any time agree to renounce, in whole or in part, whether or not for consideration, such Holder’s rights under this Agreement by written notice to the Rights Agent and Parent, which notice, if given, shall be irrevocable, and Parent may, in its sole discretion, at any time offer consideration to Holders in exchange for their agreement to irrevocably renounce their rights, in whole or in part, hereunder. Except for the rights of the Rights Agent set forth herein, the Acting Holders will have the sole right, on behalf of all Holders, by virtue of or under any provision of this Agreement, to institute any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, and no individual Holder or other group of Holders will be entitled to exercise such rights. Reasonable expenditures incurred by such Acting Holders in connection with any enforcement action hereunder may be deducted from any damages or settlement obtained prior to the distribution of any remainder to Holders generally. Acting Holders acting pursuant to this provision on behalf of all Holders shall have no liability to the other Holders for such actions.   7 . 5 .          Governing Law. This Agreement, the CVRs and all actions arising under or in connection herewith and therewith (whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.   7 . 6 .          Jurisdiction, WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. In any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the matters contemplated hereby: (i) each of Parent, the Rights Agent and the Holders irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 7.6 shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than Parent, the Rights Agent and the Holders); and (ii) each of Parent, the Rights Agent and the Holders irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, as applicable. Each of Parent, the Rights Agent and the Holders hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum (including, any claim based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens or any similar doctrine). Parent, the Rights Agent and the Holders agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Person’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.   EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

  7.7.          Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.   7 . 8 .          Termination. This Agreement will be terminated and of no force or effect, the parties hereto will have no liability hereunder (other than with respect to monies due and owing by Parent to the Rights Agent), and no payments will be required to be made, upon the earliest to occur of (a) the payment by the Rights Agent to each Holder of the Milestone Payment with respect to Milestone 2024 and the Milestone Payment with respect to Milestone 2025, such amounts not to exceed an aggregate value of $1.00 (inclusive of any payments received with respect to such CVRs by the permitted transferor of each CVR held by such Holder) as reflected on the CVR Register as of the close of business on the date of the Milestone Notice, (b) the delivery of a written notice of termination duly executed by Parent and the Acting Holders, and (c) January 1, 2028.   7.9.          Obligation of Parent. Parent shall cause Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and each Selling Entity that is controlled by Parent and its Affiliates to duly perform, satisfy and discharge each of the covenants, obligations and liabilities applicable to Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or such Selling Entity under this Agreement, and Parent shall be jointly and severally liable with Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation for the performance and satisfaction of each of said covenants, obligations and liabilities. References to Purchaser herein apply to the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time.   7 . 1 0 .        Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all contemporaneous and prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. If and to the extent that any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent or conflicts with the Merger Agreement, this Agreement govern and be controlling. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

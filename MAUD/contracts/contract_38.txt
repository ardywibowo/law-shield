E. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, each of the securityholders and each of the executive officers and directors of the Company on Schedule I have executed and delivered a stockholder support agreement (the “Company Support Agreement”) and each of the securityholders of the Company on Schedule II have executed and delivered a stockholder support agreement (the “Parent Support Agreement”, and together with the Company Support Agreement, the “Support Agreements”), in each case pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholder parties thereto have agreed to vote all of the Shares owned by them in favor of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement by the Company, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Support Agreement. 


AGREEMENT 


The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 


SECTION 1. MERGER TRANSACTION 1.1. Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall consummate the Merger, whereby Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the Surviving Corporation. 1.2. Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 1.3. Closing; Effective Time. (a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 7, or unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, the consummation of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place by electronic exchange of deliverables as promptly as practicable following, and in any case no later than the third business day after, the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements) of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at or prior to the Closing). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at or prior to Closing), then the Closing shall occur instead on the date that is the earlier to occur of (i) any business day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two (2) business days’ prior notice to the Company and (ii) one (1) business day following the final day of the Marketing Period, in each case, subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, waiver, of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at or prior to the Closing).   2








________________


(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub shall file or cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect to the Merger, in such form as required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed upon in writing by the Parties hereto and specified in the certificate of merger (such date and time, the “Effective Time”). 1.4. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time: (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to Exhibit B; (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to Exhibit C; and (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are designated as directors and officers on Schedule 1.4(c). 1.5. Conversion of Shares. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: (i) any shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Share”) then held by the Company (or held in the Company’s treasury) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; (ii) each share of Company Common Stock then held by Parent (or an assign thereof) or any Subsidiary of Parent (or an assign thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares held by Parent (or an assign thereof) or any Subsidiary of Parent (or an assign thereof), collectively, the “Parent-held Company Shares”) shall remain issued and outstanding as one share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock; (iii) except as provided in clauses “(i)” and “(ii)” above and subject to Section 1.5(b), each Share then outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares, as defined below) shall be canceled and cease to exist and be converted into the right to receive $57.50 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with Section 1.6(e), and shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6 without interest; and   3








________________


(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Merger Sub then outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted and equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change, provided, that nothing in this Section 1.5(b) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 1.6. Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 1.5. The agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5 and Section 1.8 (the total cash deposited with the Paying Agent, the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months; provided, further, that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder. (b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of any Share (or Shares) entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5 (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include the Parent-held Company Shares) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the “Certificates”) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-   4








________________


Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that any such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.6(b), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which such Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share have been converted pursuant to Section 1.5. (c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such shares to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. (e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from any cash amounts payable to any holder of Shares, Company Options or RSUs such amounts as it is required by any applicable Tax Legal Requirements to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding obligation may be avoided by a payee providing information or documentation to the applicable payor, such payor   5








________________


shall use commercially reasonable efforts to request such information from such payee and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the applicable payee with reducing or obtaining an exemption from such withholding obligation. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body in accordance with applicable Tax Legal Requirements, such amounts so remitted shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 1. 1.7. Dissenters’ Rights. Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”), shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder’s Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1.6(e)), and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide each of the holders of Shares with the notice contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL or other applicable Legal Requirements that relates to such demand, and Parent will have the opportunity and right to participate in and, after the Effective Time direct, all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing, for an amount in excess of the Merger Consideration. 1.8. Treatment of Company Options and RSUs. (a) Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as set forth in this Section 1.8(a). As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each Vested Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised as of immediately before the Effective Time shall be canceled and converted into the   6








________________


right to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such fully Vested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price payable per Share under such Vested Company Option, which amount (less applicable withholding Taxes) shall be paid in accordance with Section 1.8(c) (the “Option Consideration”). Each portion of a Company Option that is not a Vested Company Option (each, an “Unvested Company Option”) shall be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Option Consideration the holder of the Unvested Company Option would have received had the Unvested Company Option been a Vested Company Option (the “Unvested Option Consideration”), provided that the payment of the Unvested Option Consideration shall be made at the same time(s) (and consistent with the applicable payment method described in Section 1.8(c)) that the Unvested Company Options would have vested in accordance with their terms and will remain subject to the holder of the Unvested Company Option remaining in continuous service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through each such vesting date (provided, that any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger shall continue to apply to the Unvested Option Consideration).Notwithstanding the terms of this Section 1.8(a), no holder of a Company Option that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such canceled Company Option before or after the Effective Time. (b) Each restricted stock unit award granted pursuant to any of the Company Equity Plans or otherwise (each, an “RSU” and together, the “RSUs”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be treated as set forth in this Section 1.8(b). Each Vested RSU and each Director RSU shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to (i) the total number of Shares issuable in settlement to such Vested RSU or Director RSU, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, which amount (less applicable withholding Taxes) shall be paid in accordance with Section 1.8(c) (the “RSU Consideration”). Each RSU that is not a Director RSU or Vested RSU (an “Unvested RSU”) shall be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the RSU Consideration the holder of an Unvested RSU would have received had the Unvested RSU been a Director RSU or Vested RSU (the “Unvested RSU Consideration”), provided that the payment of the Unvested RSU Consideration shall be made at the same time(s) (and consistent with the applicable payment method described in Section 1.8(c)) that the Unvested RSUs would have vested in accordance with their terms and will remain subject to the holder of the Unvested RSUs remaining in continuous service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries through each such vesting date (provided that any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger shall continue to apply to the Unvested RSU Consideration). (c) On the first administratively practicable payroll date following the Effective Time (but in no event later than 20 days after the Effective Time), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the Surviving Corporation’s or the applicable Subsidiary’s payroll the aggregate Option Consideration related to Unvested Company Options and RSUs Consideration related to Vested RSUs, in either case, held by current or former employees of the Company or the other Acquired Corporations (net of any   7

withholding Taxes required to be deducted and withheld by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with Section 1.6(e)); provided, however, that to the extent the holder of a Vested Company Option or Vested RSU is not, and was not at any time during the vesting period of the Vested Company Option or Vested RSU, an employee of the Company or any other Acquired Corporation for employment tax purposes, the Vested Option Consideration or Vested RSU Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.8 with respect to such Company Option or RSU shall be deposited in the Payment Fund and paid by the Paying Agent in the manner described in Section 1.6. 1.9. Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action. 


SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows (it being understood that each representation and warranty contained in Section 2 is subject to (a) exceptions and disclosures set forth in the part or subpart of the Company Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the particular section or subsection in this Section 2, (b) any exception or disclosure set forth in any other part or subpart of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the wording of such exception or disclosure that such exception or disclosure is applicable to qualify such representation and warranty and (c) disclosure in the Company SEC Documents publicly filed or furnished on or after January 1, 2019 and prior to the date of this Agreement, other than any information in the “Risk Factors” or “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of such Company SEC Documents or other cautionary or forward-looking statements in such Company SEC Documents; provided, however, nothing disclosed in such Company SEC Documents will be deemed to modify or qualify the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.3): 2.1. Due Organization; Subsidiaries, Etc. (a) The Company is an Entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all necessary power and authority: (i) to conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently being conducted; and (ii) to own and use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and used. The Company is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign Entity, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business requires such qualification or licensing, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.   8

Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 and taking into account the Marketing Period, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any “market flex” or other similar provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter) that (1) any of the conditions to receipt of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters will not be satisfied or (2) the Financing will not be available as and when needed at the Closing. (b) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a duly executed Limited Guarantee, pursuant to which the Guarantors are guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent in connection with this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors who executed such Limited Guarantee and, assuming compliance by the Company with its representations, warranties and obligations pursuant to this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of such Guarantors under such Limited Guarantee. 3.8. Sufficiency of Proceeds. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Letters and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the exercise of the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Fee Letter), the net proceeds of the Financing will be, in the aggregate, sufficient to (a) make the payment of the Merger Consideration required to be paid on the Closing Date, (b) make any payments required pursuant Section 7 or Section 8 of the Company Convertible Notes or Article 3 or Article 10 of the Indenture arising as a result of the Merger and (c) along with the cash on hand at the Company at Closing, pay all other amounts (including all costs, fees and expenses) required to be paid at the Closing by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and the Financing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (collectively, the “Required Amount”). 3.9. Stockholder and Management Arrangements. As of the date hereof, other than the Support Agreements, neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings (whether or not binding) with any Company Stockholder (other than any existing limited partner of any Guarantor or any of its Affiliates), director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company (a) relating to (i) this Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions; or (ii) the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment) from and after the Effective Time; or (b) pursuant to which any (i) such holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder’s shares of Company Common Stock; (ii) such holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote against any superior offer; or (iii) such stockholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company (other than the Guarantors) has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.   30

Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has enacted or will enact a plan that complies with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act covering the purchase of any of the shares of the Company’s capital stock. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is an “interested stockholder” of the Company under Section 203(c) of the DGCL. 3.11. Acknowledgement by Parent and Merger Sub. (a) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is relying and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except for the representations and warranties in Section 2, including the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such representations and warranties by the Acquired Corporations constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Acquired Corporations in connection with the Transactions and each of Parent and Merger Sub understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations and warranties of any kind or nature whether express, implied or statutory are specifically disclaimed by the Acquired Corporations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, except as may be expressly provided in Section 2, no representations or warranties are made with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospective information that may have been made available, directly or indirectly, to Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Representatives or any other Person. (b) In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Acquired Corporations by Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and advisors have received and may continue to receive after the date hereof from the Acquired Corporations and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the Acquired Corporations and their businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Acquired Corporations, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, or any other person with respect thereto unless any such information is expressly addressed or included in a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Acquired Corporations nor any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, nor any other person, has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans unless any such information is expressly addressed or included in a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.   31

3.12. Solvency. As of the Effective Time and immediately after giving effect to the Merger, and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2, and the compliance by the Company with Section 4.2, (a) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets (on a going concern basis) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, taken as a whole, will exceed (i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and such Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities; and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on their existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, taken as a whole, will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, taken as a whole, will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of the foregoing, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of itself (or of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries). 3.13. Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor, finder, agent or other Person is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s, financial advisor’s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries except for Persons, if any, whose fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent and its Affiliates.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Required Vote: (i) if the Company has received a written Qualifying Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section 4.3 (other than an unintentional and immaterial breach)) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, prior to receipt of the Company Required Vote (A) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or (B) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer in accordance with Section 7.1(h), if and only if: (1) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) at least four business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a “Determination Notice”) (which notice shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation if the Company Board publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation and Company Board Determination no later than the day immediately following the expiration of the negotiation period described in this clause (i)); and (3) (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and provided to Parent the latest drafts of the definitive agreement to effect such Superior Offer, any financing commitments or other agreements to be entered into in connection with such Superior Offer, (y) the Company shall have given Parent four business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal and shall have made its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (z) after considering the results of any such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition   40

Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any “stop, look and listen” communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not, in and of itself, be considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.1 to the extent that any such communication expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation. The provisions of this Section 5.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any amendment to any of the economic terms of the Acquisition Proposal or any other material amendments to the terms of any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to four business days shall be deemed to be three business days, during which time the Company and its Representatives shall continue to comply with clause (3) above; and (ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change in Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least four business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the four business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Change in Circumstances would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and shall have made its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent requests to do so) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of any such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 5.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance shall require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to four business days shall be deemed to be three business days, during which time the Company and its Representatives shall continue to comply with clause (3) above mutatis mutandis. (c) Nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives to make any proposals to, or undertake any negotiations with, the Company as contemplated by this Section 5.1 or otherwise in connection with any Acquisition Proposal made by a third party.   41

5.2. Proxy Statement. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and no later than 30 calendar days) following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Proxy Statement”) to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to the special meeting of the Company’s stockholders (such special meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof, the “Company Stockholders Meeting”) to be held to consider, among other matters, the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) set a record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith consistent with the timing to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as described in this Section 5.2. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement, and each of the Company and Parent covenants that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with the SEC or first mailed to the Company Stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any (written or oral) comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any (written or oral) comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with a copy of all material written correspondence between the Company or any Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand (and a summary of any oral conversations) with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing such documents with the SEC and disseminating such documents to the Company Stockholders and reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional information and shall give due consideration, in good faith, to including any comments on each such document or response that are reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, disseminated to the Company Stockholders; provided, that the delivery of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any Party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party.   42

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in no event later than ten (10) calendar days, after the date on which the Company is informed that the SEC has cleared the Proxy Statement (or, if the SEC does not inform the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement on or before the tenth (10th) calendar day following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-6 under the Exchange Act, as promptly as practical following such 10th calendar day), (i) mail or cause to be mailed a letter to the holders of Shares, notice of the Company Stockholders Meeting and form of proxy accompanying the Proxy Statement that will be provided to the holders of Shares in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) take all other action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements, the Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws and the rules of the Nasdaq to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Proxy Statement mailing to stockholders is complete and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of such completed mailing (or if the Company’s nationally recognized proxy solicitor advises that thirty (30) days from the date of mailing the Proxy Statement is insufficient time to submit and obtain the Company Required Vote, such later date to which Parent consents (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld)). The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, (A) if (1) on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, or (2) prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that is required by applicable Legal Requirements is provided to the Company Stockholders within the minimum amount of time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting required by applicable Legal Requirement, the Company shall, after consultation with Parent, have the right to and (B) upon the written direction of Parent, if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to constitute a quorum or the Company has not received sufficient affirmative approvals from the Company Stockholders to obtain the Company Required Vote at the then-scheduled date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall, in either case, make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting; provided, that no (1) postponement or adjournment shall be permitted if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and (2) if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting under the circumstances contemplated by the above clause (B) for a period of up to ten business days in the aggregate (provided, that Parent shall only make up to two such requests, each for up to ten business days, and no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting). The Company shall, unless there has been a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.1(b), use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Required Vote, and to take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the Company Required Vote. The Company shall, upon the request of Parent, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable proxy solicitor of the Company to advise Parent on a reasonable basis as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Required Vote and, during the last ten business days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting shall provide Parent on each day a tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholders Meeting.   43

(c) Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Change Recommendation, the Company shall nonetheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, unless the Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 7 prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. 5.3. Filings, Consents and Approvals. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods from Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a waiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body in connection with any Antitrust Law, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions.

in the event the Closing occurs and the Company shall not take or commit to take any such action without the written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party, including any Governmental Body, under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain or prevent the Closing or delay the Closing beyond the Termination Date. (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, if applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date hereof, make an appropriate filing of all Notification and Report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions; (ii) promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days after the date hereof, make all other filings, notifications or other consents as may be required to be made or obtained by such Party under foreign Antitrust Laws in those jurisdictions identified in Schedule 5.3(c), which contains the list of the only jurisdictions where filing, notification, expiration of a waiting period or consent or approval is a condition to Closing; and (iii) cooperate and consult with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other filings or notifications or other consents required to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions. (d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.3, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including allowing the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions, (ii) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions, (iii) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly inform the other Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (v) promptly furnish to the other Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, with copies of document, communications or materials provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (documents provided pursuant to this provision may be redacted (A) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (B) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns), (vi) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the other Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any substantive communication, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and (vii) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, provide advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the other   45

Party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each Party shall respond as promptly as practicable to any reasonable request for information, documentation, other material or testimony that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental Body, in connection with such applications or filings for the Transactions. Parent shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act and all filing fees required under foreign Antitrust Laws; provided that the Parent and the Company each shall bear its own costs for the preparation of any such filings.

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause the Parent Controlled Affiliates not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, any business or any corporation, partnership, association, or other business organization or division thereof, in each case, if the entering into such agreement, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, would reasonably be expected to: (i) prevent consummation of the Merger and the Transactions, (ii) delay the Closing beyond the Termination Date, or (iii) cause any Governmental Body to prohibit the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions. 5.4. Company Options and RSUs; Company ESPP. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Awards are outstanding or otherwise) to effect the treatment of the Company Options and RSUs contemplated by the terms of Section 1.8. (a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect to any offering periods in effect as of the date hereof (the “Current ESPP Offering Periods”), no employee who is not a participant in the Company ESPP as of the date hereof may become a participant in the Company ESPP and no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on the date hereof for such Current ESPP Offering Periods; (ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iii) if the Current ESPP Offering Periods terminate prior to the Effective Time, then the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement; and (iv) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period shall be accelerated to a date prior to the Closing Date as specified by the Company Board in accordance with Section 19(c) of the Company ESPP.   46

5.5. Employee Benefits. For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company who is employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such period (each, a “Continuing Employee”) (i) base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and annual cash target bonus opportunity or annual commission opportunity (as the case may be, other than equity compensation or equity-based arrangements or long term incentive opportunities), each of which is no less favorable than the base salary (or base wages, as the case may be), annual cash target bonus opportunity or annual commission opportunity and benefits (as the case may be, other than equity compensation or equity-based arrangements or long term incentive opportunities) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and (ii) other broad-based benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing: (a) Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for all purposes, including for eligibility to participate, benefit levels (including levels of benefits under Parent’s and/or the Surviving Corporation’s vacation policy) and eligibility for vesting under Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation’s employee benefit plans and arrangements with respect to his or her length of service with the Company (and its Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing Date that was credited under a similar benefit arrangement of the Company prior to the Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not (i) result in the duplication of benefits or to benefit accrual under any pension plan or vesting under any equity compensation arrangement or (ii) with respect to Non-US Continuing Employees, apply where such treatment does not comply with applicable Legal Requirements. (b) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of benefits), assume, as of the Effective Time, the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company as in effect or amended from time to time. (c) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which such employees participated prior to the Effective Time and (ii) ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances (including paid time off), credit Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent that such service and amounts paid was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company, in each case, with respect to the Non-US Continuing Employees, to the extent required under applicable Legal Requirements.   47

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or any of its or their Affiliates from amending, modifying or terminating, or shall be construed as an amendment or modification to, any or all compensation or benefit plans, programs, policies, practices, agreements and arrangements sponsored or maintained by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or any of their Affiliates, including each Employee Plan, and nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or any of its or their Affiliates to continue any particular compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, practice, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time or to employ any particular person on any particular terms. The provisions of this Section 5.5 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.5 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. 5.6. Indemnification of Officers and Directors. (a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company existing in favor of those Persons who are directors and officers of any Acquired Corporation as of the date of this Agreement or have been directors or officers of any Acquired Corporation in the past (the “Indemnified Persons”) for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or applicable governing documents) of the applicable Acquired Corporation (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements between the Acquired Corporation and said Indemnified Persons (as set forth on Part 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the forms made available by the Company to Parent or Parent’s Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Persons, and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent available under Delaware law for a period of six years from the Effective Time, and any claim made pursuant to such rights within such six-year period shall continue to be subject to this Section 5.6(a) and the rights provided under this Section 5.6(a) until disposition of such claim. (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (together with their successors and assigns, the “Indemnifying Parties”) shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation in connection with any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of an Acquired Corporation at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or   48

claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.6(b) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 5.6(b). (c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the existing policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Acquired Corporations as of the date of this Agreement (an accurate and complete copy of which has been made available by the Company to Parent or Parent’s Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker) purchase a six-year “tail” policy for the existing policy effective as of the Effective Time) and if such “tail policy” has been obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.6(c); provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Acquired Corporations with respect to such current policy, it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount. (d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent’s option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6. (e) The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 5.6 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.   49

The Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with such litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to such litigation, and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into account. No such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 5.8. Financing. (a) Each of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing, including to: (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters until the funding of the applicable Financing thereunder, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent in the Financing Letters that are within Parent’s reasonable control, (iii) negotiate, enter into, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect thereto on a timely basis on terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, than those contemplated by the applicable Financing Letters (including, if applicable, any “market flex” provisions), (iv) enforce its rights pursuant to the Financing Letters, and (v) upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions), consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (A) give the Company prompt notice of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Letter or definitive document related to the Financing of which Parent becomes aware, (B) give the Company prompt notice of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation of the Financing Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing by any party thereto or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding ordinary course negotiations), and (C) promptly deliver to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of any amendment, modification, or waiver of any Financing Letters (including all related fee letters, which may be redacted as provided in accordance with the terms of Section 3.7) of the type described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 5.8(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require the Parent to disclose any information if such disclosure would, in its reasonable discretion (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (so long as the Parent has reasonably cooperated with the Company to permit such inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect thereto) or (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which the Parent or its Affiliates is a party).   50

required to commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than customary authorization letters). The Company and its Subsidiaries consent to the use of their logos in connection with the Debt Financing and Preferred Equity Financing so long as such logos are used solely in a manner that is customary for such purpose and not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or its Subsidiaries. (c) No Acquired Corporation shall be required (other than in respect of customary authorization letters) to (i) take any action that would subject it to liability, (ii) bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or (iii) provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing, in each case for which it has not received prior reimbursement by or on behalf of Parent or is subject to reimbursement hereunder.

The Company will be deemed to be in compliance with Section 5.8(b) at all times unless and until (i) Parent provides written notice (the “Non-Cooperation Notice”) to the Company of any alleged failure to comply, or action or failure to act which could be believed to be a breach of Section 5.8(b); (ii) Parent includes in such Non-Cooperation Notice reasonable detail regarding the cooperation required to cure such alleged failure (which will not require the Company to provide any cooperation that it would not otherwise be required to provide under Section 5.8(b)); and (iii) the Company fails to take the actions specified in such Non-Cooperation Notice within three business days from receipt of such Non-Cooperation Notice. (d) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Corporations and their respective Representatives from and against, and shall pay and reimburse the Acquired Corporations and their respective Representatives for, any and all losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 5.8(d)) and any information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent such losses result from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnified Persons, (ii) any material inaccuracy of any financial information provided by or on behalf of the Acquired Corporations in writing or (iii) the Company’s Willful Breach of its obligations under this Section 5.8). Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company (and, within 10 business days of the Closing Date or, in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, within 10 business days following the Termination Date), reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs (in the case of legal costs, limited to one outside counsel) incurred by the Acquired Corporations in connection with the cooperation of the Acquired Corporations contemplated by Section 5.8(a) (other than the preparation of its normal quarterly and annual financial statements). Any such request submitted by the Company or its Representatives hereunder this Section 5.8(d) or otherwise, shall be delivered promptly to Parent following the incurrence of such costs as a condition precedent to the Reimbursement Obligation being a valid and binding obligation on Parent.

(e) If any portion of the Debt Financing or Preferred Equity Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any flex provisions in the Debt Fee Letter) contemplated in the applicable Financing Letter and such amount is required to fund the Required Amounts (taking into account any then available debt and equity financing), Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event, obtain such Financing or such portion of the Financing from the same or alternative sources and in an amount at least equal to the applicable Financing or such unavailable and required portion thereof, as the case may be (taking into account any then available debt and equity financing) (which alternate financing may be debt financing, preferred equity financing or a combination thereof as determined by Parent, the “Alternate Financing”). Parent will promptly provide a copy of any commitment letter with respect to any Alternate Financing (and any fee letter in connection therewith) to the Company (it being understood and agreed that any such fee letter may be redacted in the same manner as the Debt Fee Letter). Any reference in this Agreement (other than Section 3.7) to (i) the “Financing Letters”, the “Debt Commitment Letter” or the “Debt Fee Letter” (or the “Preferred Equity Commitment Letter,” if applicable) will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect and any debt commitment letter in respect of any Alternate Financing (or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect and any preferred equity commitment letter in respect of any Alternate Financing, if applicable), (ii) the “Financing Letters”, the “Debt Commitment Letter”, the “Preferred Equity Commitment Letter” and the “Debt Fee Letter” shall refer to such documents as otherwise amended, supplemented, modified or replaced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) the “Financing” means the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended, supplemented, modified or replaced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 5.8 shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) pay any fees or any interest rates, in each case that are non-de minimis, applicable to the Debt Financing in excess in the aggregate of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the “market flex” provisions), or agree to any non-de minimis “market flex” term that is less favorable in the aggregate to Parent or Company than such corresponding “market flex” term contained in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise) or (iii) pay any fees or any dividend rates, in each case that are not de minimis, applicable to the Preferred Equity Financing in excess in the aggregate of those contemplated by the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).   53

(f) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (and other than (x) expressly set forth in this Section 5.8 with respect to any Alternate Financing, (y) amendments, modifications or supplements to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and (z) amendments contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof), each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver would or would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (in each case, except as expressly permitted therein) to an amount less than the Required Amount; (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (including any right to seek or obtain specific performance of the Financing Letters). (g) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing (including the Alternate Financing), is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 6 and satisfaction of the Marketing Period. If the Financing or any alternative financing (including any Alternate Financing) has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6 and the other terms of this Agreement (including Section 8.5(c)), to consummate the Merger. 5.9. Additional Agreements.

The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such Consent obtained by the Company during the Pre-Closing Period. 5.10. Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by, and whose form and content shall be agreed to by, the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement or making any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent disclosure of the content thereof was not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release, public statement or announcement to Company Associates without the other Party’s written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press,   54

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent (and shall subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it and (ii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 not being able to be satisfied prior to the Termination Date. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company (and shall subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 not being able to be satisfied prior to the Termination Date. 5.12.

SECTION 7. TERMINATION 7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time, as follows (with any termination by Parent also being an effective termination by Merger Sub): (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time; (b) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or making consummation of the Transactions illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall be final and nonappealable; provided, however, that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) if the issuance of such final and nonappealable order, decree, ruling or other action is primarily attributable to a failure on the part of such Party to perform, or comply, in any material respect with such Party’s obligations under this Agreement that was required to be performed by such Party at or prior to the Effective Time; (c) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time (whether prior to or after the receipt of the Company Required Vote) shall not have occurred on or prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on February 5, 2022 (such date, the “Termination Date”); provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a proximate cause of, or directly resulted in, the failure of the Transactions, including the Merger, to be consummated by the Termination Date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement, except that Parent’s and Merger Sub’s failure to close solely as a result of the unavailability of the Financing to be funded at the Closing which failure shall not have resulted from a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement, shall not limit Parent’s termination right pursuant to this Section 7.1(c); (d) by either Parent or the Company, if the Company fails to obtain the Company Required Vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) at which a vote is taken on the Merger; (e) by Parent (whether prior to or after the receipt of the Company Required Vote), if (i) any of the representations or warranties of the Company in this Agreement are untrue or inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become untrue or inaccurate or (ii) the Company has breached or failed to perform any covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, and in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), such untruth, inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform, as applicable, would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 if measured as of the time Parent asserts a right of termination under this Section 7.1(e), except that if such untruth, inaccuracy breach or failure to perform is capable of being cured by the Termination Date, Parent will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) prior to the delivery by Parent to the Company of written notice of such untruth, inaccuracy breach or failure to perform, delivered at least 30 days prior to such termination (the “Company Breach Notice Period”), it being understood that Parent will not be entitled to   59

(i) by the Company, at any time prior to the Effective Time, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 have been and continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions (A) that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which would have been satisfied if the Closing were to occur on such date or (B) the failure of which to be satisfied is primarily attributable to or primarily results from a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder) or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived, (ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Merger by the time the Closing was required to occur under Section 1.3(a); (iii) the Company has irrevocably notified Parent in writing that, if Parent performs its obligations hereunder and the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Preferred Equity Financing contemplated by the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter (or any alternative financing contemplated under Section 5.8(e)) is funded, the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger; (iv) the Company shall have given Parent written notice at least three business days prior to such termination stating the Company’s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(i) if Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Closing within three business days following receipt of such written notice and (v) the Merger shall not have been consummated by the end of such three business day period and all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 continue to be satisfied during such three business day period (other than those conditions (A) that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which would have been satisfied if the Closing were to occur on such date or (B) the failure of which to be satisfied is primarily attributable to or primarily results from a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder). 7.2. Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. (a) The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 (other than pursuant to Section 7.1(a)) must deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail the provision of Section 7.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such termination pursuant to such provision. (b) Any proper and valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other Representative of such Party or of such Party’s Affiliates) to the other Parties, as applicable, except that Section 5.8(d), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, and Section 8 will each survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 7.3(f), nothing in this Agreement will relieve the Company from any liability for any Willful Breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of termination of this Agreement, the Financing Sources will have no liability to the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect equityholders   61

hereunder or otherwise relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby or any Debt Financing or Preferred Equity Financing (including for any Willful Breach). In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or the Limited Guarantee, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms. 7.3. Expenses; Termination Fee. (a) Except as set forth in Section 5.3(d), Section 5.8(d) and this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. (b) Company Payments. (i) If (A) (1) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c), (2) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e), or (3) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), (B) after the date hereof and prior to the date of such termination (except in the case of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d), in which case prior to the Company Required Vote being obtained) an Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed (whether by the Company or a third party), or otherwise made known to the Company Board or Company management, and (C) within twelve months of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or a definitive agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal is entered into, then, on the earlier of the date of entry into such definitive agreement and the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to $150,000,000 in cash (the “Company Termination Fee”); provided, however, that no Company Termination Fee shall be payable under this Section 7.3(b)(i) if, prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Acquisition Proposal described in clause (B) was irrevocably withdrawn (publicly, if it had been disclosed) unless the definitive agreement or the Acquisition Proposal described in clause (C) is with the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal described in clause (B) or an Affiliate of such Person or a group of which such Person or one of its Affiliates is a party. For purposes of this Section 7.3(b)(i), all references to “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” will be deemed to be references to “50%.” (ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated (A) pursuant to Section 7.1(d) at a time when Parent had the right to terminate pursuant to Section 7.1(f) or (B) pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then the Company must promptly (and in any event within two business days) following such termination pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee. (iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then the Company must prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee.   62

(c) Parent Payment. If this Agreement is validly terminated (i) pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or Section 7.1(i) or (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at a time when the Company would be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i), then Parent must promptly (and in any event within two business days) following such termination pay to the Company $320,000,000 in cash (the “Parent Termination Fee”). (d) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company or Parent, as applicable, be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. (e) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either Party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 7.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, the payee Party commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a final non-appealable judgment against the payor Party for the amount set forth in Section 7.3 or any portion thereof, the payor Party will pay to the payee Party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by the payee Party in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Legal Requirements (collectively, the “Enforcement Expenses”). All payments under this Section 7.3 shall be made by the payor Party to the payee Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing. (f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. (i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 7.3(c) (including the Company’s right to enforce the Limited Guarantee with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee from the Guarantors) will be the sole and exclusive recourse and remedies of the Company and the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Equity Financing, the Debt Financing, the Preferred Equity Financing, the Merger, any agreement executed in connection herewith or therewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any of the Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable Legal Requirements arising out of or in connection with any breach, termination or failure or any matter forming the basis thereof. Upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of (A) the Company and its Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of   63

the Company and its Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (and/or their respective Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 7.3(f)(i) will not relieve (a) Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors from any liability for breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement or (b) any Person for liability under the Support Agreement to which such Person is party. In no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Parent Termination Fee in connection with the collection thereof against (x) Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor; or (y) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantor (the Persons in clauses (x) and (y) collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”); provided that, from and after the Effective Time, the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing, nor limit the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing or Preferred Equity Financing. In no event will Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor, any Parent Related Party or any other Person have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any Company Related Party other than the Parent Termination Fee, from Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors (without duplication) to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement, or with respect to the Guarantors, to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to payment of (1) any Enforcement Expenses from Parent, Merger Sub, or pursuant to the terms of the Limited Guarantee, the Guarantors, for any Enforcement Expenses owed to the Company under the terms of this Agreement and incurred by the Company in connection with the collection of the Parent Termination Fee and (2) the Reimbursement Obligations (in each case, up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000.00 for all Enforcement Expenses and Reimbursement Obligations) when due under the terms of this Agreement, so long as Parent receives prompt (and no later than ten (10) business days) notice of the vesting of such right under this Agreement, along with any documentation related thereto. (ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 7.3(b), together with any Enforcement Expenses incurred in connection with the collection thereof (up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000.00 (the “Company Enforcement Cap”)), will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable Legal Requirements arising out of or in connection with any breach, termination or failure of any matter forming the basis thereof. Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or   64

In no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Termination Fee, except as provided by this Section 7.3(f) (ii), against any Company Related Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.3(f)(ii) will not relieve (A) the Company from any liability (I) for any Willful Breach of this Agreement or (II) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement or (B) or any Person from liability under the Support Agreement to which such Person is a party. (iii) Each of the Parties acknowledges that any amount payable by the Company or Parent pursuant to this Section 7.3, including the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, does not constitute a penalty, but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under this Agreement in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. (g) Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.3(f), it is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 8.5(b), except that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 8.5(c), under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 8.5(b) and any payment of the Parent Termination Fee. (h) Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against the named Parties hereto (subject to the terms, conditions and other limitations set forth herein), and (i) all claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made against the Persons that are expressly identified as the Parties hereto, (ii) except as provided in any Support Agreement, no past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member general partner, limited partner, equityholder, trustee, Affiliate, agent attorney or other Representative of any party thereto (including any person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a party thereto) shall have any liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction documents or with respect to any claim or cause of action that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction documents, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and (iii) in no event will the Company seek or obtain, nor will it permit any of its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Parent Related Party (including any Non-Recourse Parent Party as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter) with respect to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guarantee or the Transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by the Equity Financing Parties, the   65

SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 8.1. Amendment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Section 5.6(e), this Agreement may be amended with the approval of the respective boards of directors of the Company and Parent at any time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any modification, waiver or termination of Sections 5.14, 7.3(f) (solely with respect to the Financing Sources), 8.2, 8.5, 8.7 or this Section 8.1 or the definition of “Financing Sources” (or any other provision of this Agreement to the extent such modification, waiver or termination would modify the substance of such Sections or such definition) that is adverse to any Financing Sources will not be effective without the prior written consent of such Financing Sources. This Section 8.1(b) will, with respect to the matters referenced herein, supersede any provision of this Agreement to the contrary. The provisions of this Section 8.1(b) will survive any termination of this Agreement. 8.2. Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections 5.14, 7.3(f) (solely with respect to the Financing Sources), 8.1, 8.5 and 8.7 and this Section 8.2 (or any other provision of this Agreement to the extent a waiver of such provision would modify the substance of the foregoing) may not be waived, in whole or in part, in a manner adverse to any of the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the adversely affected Financing Sources.   66

8.3. No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger. 8.4. Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other agreements, exhibits, annexes and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; provided, further, that, if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 8.5. Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies. (a) This Agreement and all actions based upon, arising out of or related to, this Agreement, or the Transactions contemplated thereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to Section 8.5(d), in any action or proceeding based upon, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or any of the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 8.5(a) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section 8.8. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Party’s rights to seek any post- judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt Financing, the Preferred Equity Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons,   67

At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by statute, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, except where otherwise provided by the statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes or series, present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of directors) of shares of such class or classes or series present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes or series.

Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, if any, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by an agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with Delaware law. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period. (Del.

fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the DGCL, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

(Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, § 228) (b) Every written consent or electronic transmission shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent or electronic transmission shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation in the manner herein required, written consents or electronic transmissions signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take action are delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporation’s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. (Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, § 228) (c) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing or by electronic transmission and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take action were delivered to the corporation as provided in Section 228(c) of the DGCL. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the DGCL if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL.   5.

The corporation may withhold consent for any legitimate corporate purpose, as determined by the Board of Directors. Examples of the basis for the corporation to withhold its consent include, without limitation, (i) if such Transfer to individuals, companies or any other form of entity identified by the corporation as a potential competitor or considered by the corporation to be unfriendly; (ii) if such Transfer increases the risk of the corporation having a class of security held of record by such number of persons as will require the corporation to register such class of securities pursuant to Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act, and Rule 12g5-1 promulgated thereunder, or otherwise requiring the corporation to register any class of securities under the 1934 Act; (iii) if such Transfer would result in the loss of any federal or state securities law exemption relied upon by the corporation in connection with the initial issuance of such shares or the issuance of any other securities; (iv) if such Transfer is facilitated in any manner by any public posting, message board, trading portal, internet site, or similar method of communication, including without limitation any trading portal or internet site intended to facilitate secondary transfers of securities; (v) if such Transfer is to be effected in a brokered transaction; or (vi) if such Transfer represents a Transfer of less than all of the shares or Convertible Securities then held by the holder and its affiliates or is to be made to more than a single transferee.   13.

Any Covered Securities proposed to be transferred to which Transfer the corporation has consented pursuant to Section 36(a) will first be subject to the corporation’s right of first refusal located in Section 46 hereof. (c) Any Transfer, or purported Transfer, of Covered Securities not made in strict compliance with this Section 36 shall be null and void, shall not be recorded on the books of the corporation and shall not be recognized by the corporation.

Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date.

(c) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action.

(c) Successful Defense. To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described in Section 43(a) or Section 43(b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. (d) Indemnification of Others. Subject to the other provisions of this Article XI, the corporation shall have power to indemnify its employees and its agents to the extent not prohibited by the DGCL or other applicable law.

Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or director of the corporation in defending any Proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding upon receipt of a written request therefor (together with documentation reasonably evidencing such expenses) and an undertaking by or on behalf of the person to repay such amounts if it shall ultimately be determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article XI or the DGCL. Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems reasonably appropriate and shall be subject to the corporation’s expense guidelines. The right to advancement of expenses shall not apply to any claim for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to these bylaws, but shall apply to any Proceeding referenced in Section 43(f)(2) or 43(f)(3) prior to a determination that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation.

(c) The corporation may assign its rights hereunder. (d) In the event the corporation and/or its assignee(s) elect to acquire any of the shares of the transferring stockholder as specified in said transferring stockholder’s notice, the Secretary of the corporation shall so notify the transferring stockholder and settlement thereof shall be made in cash within thirty (30) days after the Secretary of the corporation receives said transferring stockholder’s notice; provided that if the terms of payment set forth in said transferring stockholder’s notice were other than cash against delivery, the corporation and/or its assignee(s) shall pay for said shares on the same terms and conditions set forth in said transferring stockholder’s notice. (e) In the event the corporation and/or its assignees(s) do not elect to acquire all of the shares specified in the transferring stockholder’s notice, said transferring stockholder may, subject to the corporation’s approval and all other restrictions on Transfer located in Section 36 hereof, within the sixty-day period following the expiration or waiver of the option rights granted to the corporation and/or its assignees(s) herein, Transfer the shares specified in said transferring stockholder’s notice which were not acquired by the corporation and/or its assignees(s) as specified in said transferring stockholder’s notice. All shares so sold by said transferring stockholder shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this bylaw in the same manner as before said Transfer. (f) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the following transactions shall be exempt from the right of first refusal in Section 46(a): (1) A stockholder’s Transfer of any or all of such stockholder’s shares to the corporation; or (2) A corporate stockholder’s Transfer of any or all of its shares pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of any merger, consolidation, reclassification of shares or capital reorganization of the corporate stockholder, or pursuant to a sale of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of a corporate stockholder. In any such case, the transferee, assignee, or other recipient shall receive and hold such stock subject to the provisions of this Section 46 and the transfer restrictions in Section 36, and there shall be no further Transfer of such stock except in accord with this bylaw and the transfer restrictions in Section 36. (g) The provisions of this bylaw may be waived with respect to any Transfer either by the corporation, upon duly authorized action of its Board of Directors, or by the stockholders, upon the express written consent of the owners of a majority of the voting power of the corporation (excluding the votes represented by those shares to be transferred by the transferring stockholder). This bylaw may be amended or repealed either by a duly authorized action of the Board of Directors or by the stockholders, upon the express written consent of the owners of a majority of the voting power of the corporation.   21.

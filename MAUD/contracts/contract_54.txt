AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”), dated April 26, 2021, is made by and among Enterprise Financial Services Corp, a Delaware corporation (“Enterprise”), Enterprise Bank & Trust, a Missouri state-chartered trust company with banking powers and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enterprise (“EB&T”), First Choice Bancorp, a California corporation (“First Choice”), and First Choice Bank, a California chartered commercial bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of First Choice (“First Choice Bank”). W I T N E S E T H: WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Enterprise and First Choice have determined that this Agreement and the business combination and related transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective entities and shareholders and consistent with and in furtherance of their respective business strategies; WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms, and subject to the conditions, of this Agreement, (i) First Choice will merge with and into Enterprise, with Enterprise as the surviving entity (the “Merger”), and thereafter (ii) First Choice Bank will merge with and into EB&T, with EB&T as the surviving entity (the “Bank Merger”); WHEREAS, for United States federal income Tax purposes, the parties intend that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code (a “368 Reorganization”) and intend for this Agreement to constitute a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Regulations; WHEREAS, as a material inducement and as additional consideration to Enterprise to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors of First Choice, solely in their capacity as shareholders of First Choice, have entered into a voting agreement with Enterprise dated as of the date hereof, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (collectively, the “Voting Agreements”), pursuant to which each such Person has agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of First Choice Stock owned by such Person in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Voting Agreements; WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement and to prescribe certain conditions thereto; and WHEREAS, the parties desire that capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions ascribed to such terms when they are first used herein or as otherwise specified in Article 8 hereof. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:








________________


ARTICLE 1 THE MERGER Section 1.01    The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, First Choice shall merge with and into Enterprise in accordance with the DGCL and the CGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of First Choice shall cease and Enterprise shall survive and continue to exist as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (Enterprise, as the surviving entity in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the “Surviving Entity”). 


Section 1.02    Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity upon consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Enterprise as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Section 1.03    Directors and Officers of Surviving Entity. (a )    Subject to the provisions of Section 1.03(b), the directors and officers of Enterprise immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, serve as directors and officers of the Surviving Entity. (b)    Subject to compliance with applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable, the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on which the Enterprise Common Stock is then listed or quoted)), prior to the Effective Time, Enterprise shall take all necessary corporate or other action so that from and after the Effective Time, at the election of Enterprise, either (i) the size of the board of directors of Enterprise (the “Enterprise Board”) is increased by one member, or (ii) one of the then incumbent directors resigns from the Enterprise Board, and in either case one member of the First Choice Board who is independent with respect to Enterprise for purposes of the listing requirements of Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on which the Enterprise Common Stock is then listed or quoted), selected by mutual agreement of First Choice and Enterprise (the “First Choice Director”), is elected or appointed to the Enterprise Board to fill the vacancy on the Enterprise Board created by such increase or resignation, as applicable. Until the Effective Time, First Choice shall cause the First Choice Board to maintain at least one director who is a member of the First Choice Board on the date of this Agreement and who is independent with respect to Enterprise for purposes of the listing requirements of Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on which the Enterprise Common Stock is then listed or quoted). Section 1.04    Bank Merger. ( a )    At such time following the Effective Time as Enterprise may determine, First Choice Bank will be merged with and into EB&T upon the terms and with the effect set forth in the Plan of Bank Merger, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

________________


( b )    The directors and officers of EB&T immediately prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger shall, from and after such effective time, serve as directors and officers of EB&T, as the surviving bank. Section 1.05    Effective Time; Closing. 


( a )    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Enterprise and First Choice will make all such filings as may be required by applicable Laws to consummate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon filing the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date or such later date and/or time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the “Effective Time”). Promptly thereafter, Enterprise shall file a copy of the Certificate of Merger certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with the Secretary of State of the State of California. ( b )    The Bank Merger shall become effective as set forth in the Plan of Bank Merger. Promptly following effectiveness of the Bank Merger, EB&T shall file a copy of the articles of merger certified by the Missouri Division of Finance with the Secretary of State of the State of California and the DFPI. First Choice Bank shall execute such certificates or articles of combination and such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by Enterprise to effectuate the Bank Merger. ( c )    The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the “Closing”) shall take place on such date and at such time as Enterprise and First Choice mutually agree, which such date shall be no later than fifteen (15) days after all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article 6 (other than conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof (such date, the “Closing Date”) remotely via the electronic exchange of documentation between the parties (via electronic transmission or other similar means for exchanging documentation), or at such place as Enterprise and First Choice may mutually agree. Section 1.06    Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Enterprise shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents, assignments or assurances in Law or any other actions are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, First Choice, First Choice Bank and their respective Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have granted to Enterprise an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver, in its official corporate capacity, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law and to take any other actions as are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of Enterprise are authorized in the name of First Choice, First Choice Bank and their respective Subsidiaries to execute and deliver any and all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law and to take any and all such actions. Section 1.07    Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. At Enterprise’s election, without the approval of First Choice, the business combination contemplated by this Agreement may alternatively be structured so that (a) First Choice is merged with and into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Enterprise, (b) any direct or indirect wholly-owned

________________


Subsidiary of Enterprise is merged with and into First Choice, (c) First Choice Bank is merged with and into any other direct or indirect wholly- owned Subsidiary of EB&T, (d) any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of EB&T is merged with and into First Choice Bank, (e) EB&T is merged with and into First Choice Bank, or (f) the Bank Merger is delayed or abandoned and each of First Choice Bank and EB&T continue to operate as separate banking Subsidiaries of Enterprise; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Merger Consideration, (ii) impede or delay consummation of the Merger (including any Closing Regulatory Approval), (iii) adversely alter or change the United States federal income Tax treatment of holders of First Choice Stock in connection with the Merger from what such treatment would have been absent such change (including, but not limited to, any such change that would result in the Merger failing to qualify as a 368 Reorganization), (iv) require submission to or approval of First Choice’s shareholders after the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement has been submitted to or approved by First Choice’s shareholders, (v) require submission to or approval of Enterprise’s shareholders after the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement has been submitted to or approved by Enterprise’s shareholders; or (vi) otherwise adversely affect First Choice, First Choice Bank or any shareholder of First Choice in any material respect. In the event that Enterprise elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents reasonably required to reflect the change. ARTICLE 2 MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES Section 2.01    Stock. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Enterprise, First Choice or any shareholder of First Choice: (a)    Each share of Enterprise Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger. (b)    Each share of First Choice Stock owned directly by Enterprise, First Choice or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as treasury stock or otherwise (other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers), immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. ( c )    Subject to the other provisions of this Article 2, each share of First Choice Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of First Choice Common Stock underlying First Choice Stock Awards) (other than First Choice Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.6603 (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 5.18(d), the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of Enterprise Common Stock. (d )    After the Effective Time, (i) all shares of First Choice Common Stock shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, except as to Dissenting Shares, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the

________________


Stock Consideration, and (ii) each holder of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share, except as to Dissenting Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Stock Consideration. Section 2.02    Stock Options and Other Stock Based Awards. (a)    Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this Section 2.02(a) pertain to all options to acquire shares of First Choice Common Stock which are outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “First Choice Options”). At the Effective Time, each First Choice Option granted under any First Choice Benefit Plan that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest or be forfeited, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of the applicable First Choice Benefit Plan and/or award agreement. Each vested and outstanding First Choice Option at the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time and exchanged for the right to receive (without interest) an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of First Choice Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such First Choice Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the Average VWAP as of the Trading Day immediately preceding the Closing Date over (B) the per-share exercise price of such First Choice Option (the “Option Consideration”), less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such cash payment. The Surviving Entity shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Option Consideration to holders of First Choice Options through the next administratively practicable payroll following the Effective Time. First Choice shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the written acknowledgement of each holder of a then-outstanding First Choice Option with regard to the cancellation of such First Choice Option and the payment therefor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. ( b )    The provisions of this Section 2.02(b) pertain to all restricted stock awards and other stock-based awards granted by First Choice, including but not limited to awards granted under the First Choice Stock Plans, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time except for First Choice Options (collectively, the “First Choice Stock Awards”). At the Effective Time, each First Choice Stock Award that is unsettled or unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest or be cancelled, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of the applicable First Choice Stock Plan and/or award agreement. Section 2.03    Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, the total consideration to be paid by Enterprise in the Merger (the “Merger Consideration”) is (a) the aggregate number of shares of Enterprise Common Stock to be issued to holders of First Choice Common Stock, pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and Section 2.02(b) above, plus cash in lieu of any fractional share interest paid pursuant to Section 2.04 (the “Stock Consideration”), and (b) the aggregate amount of Option Consideration payable to holders of First Choice Options pursuant to Section 2.02(a) above. Section 2.04    Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Enterprise Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. Each holder of shares of First Choice Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been

________________


entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Enterprise Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount of cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional share (rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a share) by the Average VWAP as of the Trading Day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Section 2.05    Plan of Reorganization. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a 368 Reorganization, and that this Agreement shall constitute a “plan of reorganization” as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and Section 1.368-2(g) of the Regulations. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a 368 Reorganization, and each of Enterprise and First Choice shall obtain the opinions referred to in Section 6.01(e). Section 2.06    Dissenting Shares. Each outstanding share of First Choice Common Stock the holder of which has perfected his, her or its right to dissent pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, including making a demand of First Choice to purchase his, her or its shares pursuant to Section 1301 of Chapter 13 of the CGCL and submitting his, her or its shares for endorsement pursuant to Section 1302 of Chapter 13 of the CGCL, and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the “Dissenting Shares”), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the CGCL. First Choice shall give Enterprise prompt notice upon receipt by First Choice of any such written demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of First Choice Common Stock and of withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments provided pursuant to the CGCL. If any holder of First Choice Common Stock shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent (through failure to perfect or otherwise), the First Choice Common Stock held by such holder shall be converted on a share by share basis into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by Enterprise within the time period set forth in the CGCL. Section 2.07    Deposit of Stock Consideration. ( a )    A t or before the Effective Time, Enterprise shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent stock certificates or, at Enterprise’s option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the number of shares of Enterprise Common Stock issuable to the holders of First Choice Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(c) above and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.04 (collectively, the “Exchange Fund”), and Enterprise shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay such Stock Consideration from the Exchange Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. ( b )    Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed as of the first anniversary of the Closing Date (as well as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Enterprise. Any former shareholders of First Choice who have not theretofore complied with Section 2.08 shall thereafter look only to Enterprise for payment of the Stock Consideration. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which the Stock

Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of First Choice Common Stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Stock Consideration which is paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Section 2.08    Exchange Procedures. (a)    Enterprise shall cause the Exchange Agent, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than ten (10) days thereafter, to mail to each holder of a Certificate and each holder of a Book-Entry Share(s), (i) a letter of transmittal (“Letter of Transmittal”), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Stock Consideration. The Letter of Transmittal shall be subject to the approval of First Choice (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (b)    Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share(s), together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a (i) a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable) representing the number of shares of Enterprise Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, and (ii) a check in the amount equal to (A) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Enterprise Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.04 and (B) any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.08(d). No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Stock Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.08(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Stock Consideration. (c )    In the event a transfer of ownership of a Certificate is not registered in the stock transfer records of First Choice, the Stock Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate shall be issued or paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate is registered if (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, (ii) the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of Enterprise, that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable, and (iii) the Person requesting such issuance or payment shall have complied with the

________________


provisions of the Letter of Transmittal. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of First Choice Common Stock represented by any Certificate, Enterprise and Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any Stock Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate and file Legal Proceedings interpleading all parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto. ( d )    If a dividend or other distribution is declared by Enterprise in respect of the Enterprise Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of Enterprise Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Enterprise Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article 2. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and the issuance of Enterprise Common Stock in exchange therefor, there shall be paid to the holder of such Enterprise Common Stock, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender payable with respect to such Enterprise Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Enterprise Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. ( e )    The parties intend that no withholding shall be required with respect to the Merger. However, Enterprise (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of First Choice Common Stock or First Choice Options such amounts as Enterprise is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law.

( a )    Following the execution of this Agreement, First Choice shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of First Choice, all action necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty-five (45) days following the time when the Registration Statement becomes effective, subject to extension with the consent of Enterprise (not to be unreasonably withheld or conditioned)) to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and any other matters required to be approved by First Choice’s shareholders in order to permit consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “First Choice Meeting”), and shall, subject to Section 5.11 and the last sentence of this Section 5.04(a), use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to solicit such approval by such shareholders. Subject to Section 5.11 and the last sentence of this Section 5.04(a), First Choice shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Requisite First Choice Shareholder Approval to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Except with the prior approval of Enterprise, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, no other matters shall be submitted for approval of First Choice shareholders at the First Choice Meeting. If the First Choice Board makes a First Choice Subsequent Determination in accordance with Section 5.11, First Choice shall not be required to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to solicit shareholders to approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) or to use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Requisite First Choice Shareholder Approval to consummate the Merger.

In the event that there are sufficient shares of First Choice Common Stock represented (in person or by proxy) at the First Choice Meeting to secure the Requisite First Choice Shareholder Approval, First Choice will not adjourn or postpone the First Choice Meeting unless the First Choice Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with the advice of counsel, that (i) such adjournment or postponement is required by applicable Law in order to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus is provided to the holders of First Choice Common Stock with a reasonable amount of time in advance of the First Choice Meeting or (ii) failure to do so would otherwise breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. First Choice shall keep Enterprise updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection with the First Choice Meeting as reasonably requested by Enterprise.

The Enterprise Board shall at all times prior to and during the Enterprise Meeting recommend such approval (the “Enterprise Recommendation” ) and (b) the Proxy Statement-Prospectus shall include the Enterprise Recommendation. Neither the Enterprise Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse in any respect to the interest of First Choice, or take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with, the Enterprise Recommendation.

After the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, First Choice, at its own expense, shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its shareholders. ( b )    Enterprise shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to ensure that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and the Registration Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Enterprise and First Choice agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time it is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented, or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement- Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to shareholders, at the time of the First Choice Meeting and Enterprise Meeting, or at any time it is amended or supplemented, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each of Enterprise and First Choice further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement-Prospectus. Enterprise will advise First Choice, promptly after Enterprise receives notice thereof, (A) of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, (B) of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Enterprise Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, and (C) of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or upon the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or its staff.

Enterprise will provide First Choice and its counsel with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to the First Choice Meeting and Enterprise Meeting there shall occur any event that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement, Enterprise shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly prepare and file such amendment or supplement with the SEC (if

required under applicable Law) and cooperate with First Choice to mail such amendment or supplement to First Choice shareholders (if required under applicable Law). (c )    Enterprise agrees to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the shares of Enterprise Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on which the Enterprise Common Stock is then listed or quoted), subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. Section 5.08    Regulatory Filings; Consents. (a)    Each of Enterprise and First Choice and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts (i) to prepare all documentation (including the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement-Prospectus), and Enterprise shall make, all filings with, to send all notices to, and to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of, all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, the Closing Regulatory Approvals and the consents, approvals and notices under the Contracts set forth on Section 3.05(c), (ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and (iii) to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as expeditiously as practicable; provided, however, that in no event shall Enterprise be required to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or other requirement which would (A) materially prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Enterprise or any Enterprise Subsidiary (including First Choice and any First Choice Subsidiary after Closing) of all or any material portion of its business or assets, (B) compel Enterprise or any Enterprise Subsidiary (including First Choice and any First Choice Subsidiary after Closing) to dispose of all or any material portion of its business or assets, (C) cause any portion of any First Choice Regulatory Agreement to be enforceable against Enterprise or EB&T after the Merger, or (D) be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Entity, taken as a whole (together, the “ Burdensome Conditions”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, Enterprise and First Choice shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare, and Enterprise shall file, any applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the Closing Regulatory Approvals and any other Permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Bank Merger). Subject to applicable Law, (w) Enterprise and First Choice will furnish each other and each other’s counsel with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, trustees, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with obtaining any Regulatory Approval, (x) each party hereto shall have the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to such party and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in connection with obtaining any Regulatory Approval, (y) Enterprise and First Choice shall each furnish to the other for review a copy of each such filing made in connection with obtaining any Regulatory Approval prior to its filing and (z) Enterprise and First Choice will notify the other promptly and shall promptly furnish the other with copies of any communication from any Governmental Authority received by it with respect to the effort to

obtain and receipt of Regulatory Approvals (and its response thereto); provided, that in no event shall Enterprise, EB&T, First Choice or First Choice Bank be obligated to provide or otherwise disclose to the other confidential supervisory information regarding themselves, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. (b)    First Choice will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, and Enterprise shall reasonably cooperate with First Choice at First Choice’s request, to obtain all consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations with respect to any Contracts set forth on Section 3.05(c) of the First Choice Disclosure Schedule and all Leases set forth on Section 3.30(e) of the First Choice Disclosure Schedule; provided, that, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, neither First Choice nor any First Choice Subsidiary will be required to make any payment to or grant any concessions to any third party in connection therewith. Each party will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, notify the other party promptly and promptly furnish the other party with copies of notices or other communications received by such party or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from such party, its Subsidiaries or its representatives). First Choice and Enterprise will reasonably consult with each other and their respective representatives so as to permit First Choice and Enterprise and their respective representatives to be knowledgeable regarding the status of such effort, cooperate to take appropriate measures to obtain such consents and avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may result from the foregoing. Section 5.09    Publicity. Enterprise and First Choice shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld; provided, however, that Enterprise and First Choice may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations of the SEC or Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on which the Enterprise Common Stock is then listed or quoted). It is understood that Enterprise shall assume primary responsibility for the preparation of joint press releases relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Section 5.10    Access; Current Information. ( a )    During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time (or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7), First Choice and Enterprise shall, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of Enterprise and EB&T and First Choice and First Choice Bank, respectively, and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, (i) upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, afford the other party and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives access (subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by First Choice or Enterprise with respect to in-person access in light of COVID-19 concerns), during

normal business hours, to its and its Subsidiaries’ books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and, subject to the consent of the independent auditors, work papers of independent auditors), information technology systems, properties and personnel and to such other information as the other party may reasonably request, and (ii) furnish to the other party, upon reasonable request, all such other information concerning its business, properties, personnel and Subsidiaries that is substantially similar in scope to the information provided to the other party in connection with its diligence review prior to the date of this Agreement. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of business of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries. ( b )    During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time (or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7), First Choice will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer with representatives of Enterprise and report the general status of its ongoing operations, at such times and in such manner as Enterprise may reasonably request. ( c )    During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time (or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7), each of Enterprise and First Choice will promptly notify the other party in writing of any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Enterprise Disclosure Schedule or the First Choice Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or which is necessary to correct any information in such party’s Disclosure Schedule that has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. Each such notice shall include, or be accompanied by, a proposed supplement or amendment to such party’s Disclosure Schedule regarding such matter (a “Schedule Supplement”). Each Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be incorporated into and to supplement and amend the First Choice Disclosure Schedule or Enterprise Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that if the matter which is the subject of the Schedule Supplement constitutes or relates to something that could provide Enterprise with a right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(e) and Enterprise does not elect to terminate this Agreement prior to the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the applicable cure period and (ii) the Expiration Date, then Enterprise shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement on account of such matter. (d)    No investigation by a party or its representatives shall be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the other party or its Subsidiary bank set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the respective obligations of Enterprise and First Choice to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. (e)    Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.10 to the contrary, no party shall be required to provide the other party with access or disclose information where such access or disclosure would, in the reasonable opinion of such party’s counsel, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the such party, or contravene any binding Contract entered into by such party prior to the date of this Agreement or any Law, Order or fiduciary duty applicable to such party. In the event any of the restrictions in this Section 5.10(e) shall apply, each party shall use

Commercially Reasonable Efforts to make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Laws. Section 5.11    No Solicitation by First Choice; Superior Proposals. ( a )    Subject to Section 5.11(b), First Choice and First Choice Bank shall not, and shall instruct their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, Affiliates and other agents (collectively, the “First Choice Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than Enterprise or any Enterprise Subsidiary) any information or data with respect to First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary or otherwise in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person from, waive any provision of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which First Choice is a party in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by this Section 5.11(b)(iii)), provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.11(a) shall prohibit First Choice, the First Choice Board or any First Choice Representative from making any inquiries with respect to a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal to enable the First Choice Board to make the determination described in Section 5.11(b). Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by First Choice or any First Choice Representative, whether or not such First Choice Representative is so authorized and whether or not such First Choice Representative is purporting to act on behalf of First Choice or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by First Choice. First Choice and First Choice Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the First Choice Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal. (b )    Notwithstanding Section 5.11(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite First Choice Shareholder Approval, First Choice may take any of the actions described in Section 5.11(a) if, but only if, (i) First Choice has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.11; (ii) the First Choice Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (a) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (b) the failure to take such actions would breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (iii) prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with respect to First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, First Choice receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with

terms no less favorable to First Choice than those contained in the confidentiality agreement with Enterprise (it being understood that nothing therein shall have the effect of a standstill provision). First Choice shall promptly provide to Enterprise any non-public information regarding First Choice or First Choice Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not previously provided to Enterprise, such additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such information to such other party. ( c )    First Choice shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Enterprise in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, First Choice or the First Choice Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic communications), except to the extent that such materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement or any such disclosure would jeopardize attorney-client privilege). First Choice agrees that it shall keep Enterprise informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including any amendments or modifications of any material terms to such proposal, offer or request). ( d )    Subject to Section 5.11(e), neither the First Choice Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse in any respect to the interest of Enterprise, or take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with, the First Choice Recommendation; (ii) fail to publicly affirm the First Choice Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following a request by Enterprise (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the First Choice Meeting); (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) resolve to take, or publicly announce an intention to take, any of the foregoing actions (each of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) a “First Choice Subsequent Determination”); or (v) enter into (or cause First Choice or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (a) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.11(b)) or (b) requiring First Choice to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. ( e )    Notwithstanding Section 5.11(d) or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Requisite First Choice Shareholder Approval, the First Choice Board (or any committee thereof) may make a First Choice Subsequent Determination after the fifth (5 ) Business Day following Enterprise’s receipt of a notice (the “Notice of Determination”) from First Choice informing Enterprise that the First Choice Board (or such committee) has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, 


th

that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a First Choice Subsequent Determination with respect to such Superior Proposal would breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood that the initial determination under this clause will not be considered a First Choice Subsequent Determination), but only if: (i) the Notice of Determination includes or is accompanied by the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, including copies of any proposed material agreements providing for such Superior Proposal; (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of Determination (the “Notice Period”), First Choice and the First Choice Board shall have negotiated in good faith with Enterprise, to the extent Enterprise desires to negotiate, to make such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable First Choice to proceed with the First Choice Recommendation without a First Choice Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that Enterprise shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms, if any, as may have been proposed by Enterprise in writing before expiration of the Notice Period, the First Choice Board has again in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, made the determination that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a First Choice Subsequent Determination with respect to such Superior Proposal would breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the event of any material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a Notice of Determination and that occur prior to a First Choice Subsequent Determination, First Choice shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Determination to Enterprise and again comply with the requirements of this Section 5.11(e), except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days. Section 5.12    Indemnification. (a)    For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of First Choice in effect on the date of this Agreement, and in any event subject to the provisions of Section 5.12(b), Enterprise shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors and officers of First Choice and First Choice Bank (the “Indemnified Parties”) against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Legal Proceeding arising out of actions or omissions of such Persons in the course of performing their duties for First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary occurring at or before the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a “Claim”), and shall promptly advance expenses to each Indemnified Party from time-to- time as incurred in connection with a Claim, to the same extent as the Indemnified Parties have the right to expense advancement pursuant to applicable Law, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of First Choice in effect on the date of this Agreement, and/or any written agreement by and between First Choice or First Choice Bank and an Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of such Indemnified Party currently in effect as of the date of this Agreement; provided, that each Indemnified Party

to whom expenses are advanced provides a reasonable and customary undertaking to repay such advances, if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. ( b )    Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.12 shall promptly notify Enterprise upon learning of any Claim, provided, that failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of Enterprise under this Section 5.12, unless, and only to the extent that, Enterprise is materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In the event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time), (i) (A) Enterprise shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Enterprise shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses for other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, unless such Indemnified Party is advised in writing by counsel that the defense of such Indemnified Party by Enterprise would create an actual or potential conflict of interest (in which case, Enterprise shall not be obligated to reimburse or indemnify any Indemnified Party for the expenses of more than one separate counsel in addition to one local counsel in the jurisdiction where defense of any Claim has been or is to be asserted (if the Claim involves more than one Indemnified Party, Enterprise shall only be obligated to pay for one separate counsel and one local counsel for all Indemnified Parties)), and (B) such Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (ii) Enterprise shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and Enterprise shall not settle any Claim without such Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (iii) Enterprise shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be in violation of any applicable United States federal or state banking Laws or regulations, or in the event that a United States federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine by final and unappealable adjudication that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws, whether or not related to banking Laws. ( c )    Subject to the terms described in this Section 5.12(c), Enterprise shall (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, First Choice’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties, (ii) obtain, as of the Effective Time, “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years following the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties as the policies currently provided by First Choice, or (iii) purchase and provide for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from a carrier assigned a claims paying ability rating by A.M. Best First Choice, Inc. of “A (Excellent)” or higher with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties as the policies currently provided by First Choice, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall Enterprise be required to expend per year pursuant to this Section 5.12(c) more than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual cost currently expended by First Choice with respect to such insurance (the “Maximum D&O Premium”); provided, further, that if the amount of the annual premium necessary to

maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum D&O Premium, Enterprise shall maintain or procure the most advantageous policies of directors’ and officers’ insurance (or “tail” coverage obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum D&O Premium). In connection with the foregoing, First Choice agrees that in order for Enterprise to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.12(c), Indemnified Parties may be required to provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such reasonable and customary representations as such insurer may request. (d )    If, following the Effective Time, Enterprise or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Enterprise shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.12. ( e )    These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party. After the Effective Time, the obligations of Enterprise under this Section 5.12 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 5.12 that is denied by Enterprise, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement of expense, in whole or in part, then Enterprise or the Surviving Entity shall pay such Indemnified Party’s costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with enforcing such claim against Enterprise. (f)    Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.12 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. ( g )    Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring EB&T to indemnify, hold harmless, release, guarantee the obligations of, or purchase or acquire assets or liabilities of, Enterprise or any Affiliate of Enterprise. (h)    Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring First Choice Bank to indemnify, hold harmless, release, guarantee the obligations of, or purchase or acquire assets or liabilities of, First Choice or any Affiliate of First Choice.

and benefit accrual purposes (other than benefit accruals under a defined pension plan), all service of the Continuing Employees with First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary (including any predecessors thereof) as if such service were with Enterprise; provided, however, such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not recognized under the corresponding First Choice Benefit Plan. (b)    Enterprise shall maintain the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the Continuing Employees (including salary, incentive compensation opportunities, severance benefits, medical benefits, other welfare benefits, fringe benefits, work location, and position) on terms and conditions that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the terms and conditions of employment of such Continuing Employees provided by First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing until the harmonization date identified on Section 5.13(b) of the Enterprise Disclosure Schedule applicable to such term or condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this provision shall prevent Enterprise from transferring some or all of the Continuing Employees to Enterprise’s benefit plans on substantially similar terms as existing Enterprise employees and nothing in this section shall guarantee any Continuing Employee the right to continued employment for any period of time. ( c )    Enterprise shall (i) waive or cause to be waived any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or pre-existing condition limitations and similar limitations with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such group health plan. (d)    With respect to severance benefits, in addition to the term of employment of such Continuing Employee at Enterprise and/or EB&T, Enterprise shall also credit the term of employment of any Continuing Employee who becomes entitled to severance benefits after Closing with service credit relating to their service provided to First Choice and/or First Choice Bank prior to the Effective Time to the extent such service would have been recognized under the First Choice’s severance plan as in effect immediately prior to Closing. (e)    This Section 5.13 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.13, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.13. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.13 shall not create any right in any employee or any other Person to any continued employment with First Choice or its Subsidiaries, Enterprise or any of their respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever. Section 5.14    Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the Effective Time, each of Enterprise and First Choice shall take all steps as may be necessary or appropriate to exempt the conversion of shares of First Choice Common Stock into shares of Enterprise

Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by employees and directors of First Choice who may become an officer or director of Enterprise subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. Section 5.15    Notification of Certain Changes. Enterprise and First Choice shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event (a) having, or which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) which it believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of any of its or its Subsidiary bank’s representations, warranties or covenants contained herein, which breach could reasonably be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article 6 to be satisfied on the Closing Date, provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any change or event shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 5.15, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying change or event would independently result in a failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 to be satisfied on the Closing Date. Section 5.16    Transition; Informational Systems Conversion. From and after the date hereof, each of Enterprise and First Choice shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to facilitate the integration of First Choice and First Choice Subsidiaries with the business of Enterprise and Enterprise Subsidiaries following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the data processing and related electronic informational systems of First Choice and First Choice Subsidiaries (the “Informational Systems Conversion”) in such a manner reasonably sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that a successful Informational Systems Conversion will occur. The Informational Systems Conversion will occur, after the Closing Date and at such date as may be specified by Enterprise, subject to any applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, First Choice shall, subject to any such applicable Laws: (i) reasonably cooperate with Enterprise to establish a project plan as specified by Enterprise to effectuate the Informational Systems Conversion; (ii) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to have First Choice’s outside contractors continue to support both the Informational Systems Conversion effort and its ongoing needs until the Informational Systems Conversion can be established; (iii) provide, or use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain from any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably requested by Enterprise for use in planning the Informational Systems Conversion, as soon as reasonably practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to First Choice’s personnel and facilities and its outside contractors’ personnel and facilities, to the extent necessary to enable the Informational Systems Conversion effort to be completed on schedule; and (v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the Contracts of outside data, item and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to which First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary is bound, if requested to do so by Enterprise, to the extent permitted by such Contracts; provided, that First Choice shall not be required to take any action under this Section 5.16 that, after consultation with Enterprise regarding First Choice’s concerns in the matter, is reasonably likely to prejudice or adversely affect in any material respect its rights under any such Contracts in the event the Closing does not occur. First Choice shall pay any reasonable out of

pocket expenses due third parties incurred in connection with the actions described in this Section 5.16. Such access as contemplated by this Section 5.16 shall be conducted by Enterprise in a manner which does not adversely affect the normal operations of First Choice or First Choice Bank and neither First Choice nor First Choice Bank shall be required to provide access to or disclose information (i) which would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of First Choice or First Choice Bank or contravene any binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or any Law, Order or fiduciary duty, (ii) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, relating to an Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a First Choice Subsequent Determination or any matters related thereto, or (iii) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, related to First Choice’s or First Choice Bank’s directors’, officers’, employees’, accountants’, counsels’, advisors’ (including investment bankers), agents’, or other representatives’, consideration of, or deliberations regarding, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.17    No Control of Other Party’s Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Enterprise, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of First Choice or First Choice Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give First Choice, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Enterprise or Enterprise Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of First Choice and Enterprise shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations. Section 5.18    Environmental Matters. (a)    Phase I Assessments. For any First Choice Leased Property which is identified by Enterprise within twenty (20) days of this Agreement, Enterprise may, at its sole cost and expense, obtain, within sixty (60) days after the date of such notice, written reports of a Phase I ESA for, and of the presence or absence of asbestos-containing material (“ACM”) at, each such property, prepared by an environmental consultant or consultants experienced in performing Phase I ESAs of, and in investigating for ACM at, such real property (“Environmental Consultant”) and reasonably acceptable to First Choice. Each Phase I ESA and report on ACM (an “ACM report”) shall be delivered in counterparts to Enterprise and First Choice. The Environmental Consultant will include customary language allowing both Enterprise and First Choice to rely upon its findings and conclusions. The Environmental Consultant will provide a draft of any Phase I ESA to First Choice and Enterprise for review and comment prior to the finalization of such report. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in this Section, neither Enterprise nor the Environmental Consultant will conduct or cause to be conducted any invasive, intrusive or destructive inspections or other sampling or testing on the First Choice Leased Property, including, without limitation, of the air, soil, soil gas, vapors, surface water, groundwater, building materials or other environmental media, thereon. (b)    Phase II Assessments. In the event any Phase I ESA or ACM report (including a Phase I ESA that First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary caused to be performed within one (1) year prior to the date of this Agreement) discloses that property subject

________________


t o such Phase I ESA or ACM report may be impacted or have its use restricted by any Recognized Environmental Condition or Historical Recognized Environmental Condition (as each term is defined by ASTM E1527-13), any PFAS, or any ACM for which First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary would be liable before the Effective Time and which, in the good faith reasonable belief of Enterprise, would result in a material liability to the Surviving Entity or EB&T (as the surviving bank in the Bank Merger) following the Effective Time and as such warrants further review or investigation, Enterprise shall give notice of the same (a “Phase I Notice”) to First Choice no later than five (5) Business Days following Enterprise’s receipt of the relevant Phase I ESA and ACM report. First Choice may then, in its sole and absolute discretion and without any obligation whatsoever to do so, within an additional twenty (20) day period, retain the Environmental Consultant to conduct a Phase II environmental site assessment in accordance with ASTM Standard E1903-11 (“Phase II ESA”) of, and to sample for ACM at, the relevant property or facility; provided, however, that such Phase II ESA and sampling for ACM shall be completed, and a written report of the Phase II ESA and of the analytical results of any sampling for ACM prepared, no later than sixty (60) days after First Choice receives from Enterprise the Phase I Notice for the relevant property; and provided further, that with respect to any First Choice Leased Property, First Choice will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the relevant property owner’s consent for such Phase II ESA. Enterprise acknowledges and understands that such consent may not be able to be obtained. The scope of the Phase II ESA and of any sampling for ACM shall be mutually determined by Enterprise and First Choice in their reasonable discretion after consultation with the other party, and all reasonable costs and expenses associated with such Phase II ESA and ACM sampling and associated reports shall be borne by Enterprise. First Choice shall provide copies of the draft and final Phase II ESA and ACM reports, if any, to Enterprise promptly following the receipt of any such report(s) by First Choice. ( c )    Remediation Estimates. In the event any Phase II ESA or ACM report confirms the presence of any ACM or of environmental contamination, including, without limitation, a release or threat or release from an abandoned underground storage tank or the presence of other Hazardous Substances, in each case present in concentrations above applicable standards under applicable Environmental Laws or that, based on the reasonable determination of the Environmental Consultant, would, or would reasonably be expected to, threaten human health or the environment, or if First Choice chooses not to conduct Phase II ESA and ACM report as reasonably requested by Enterprise pursuant to Section 5.18(b), Enterprise may elect to require First Choice to obtain, prior to the Closing Date and as soon as reasonably practical but in no event more than sixty (60) days after Enterprise receives the relevant Phase I ESA, Phase II ESA, or ACM report, and at First Choice’s sole cost and expense, from the Environmental Consultant or another nationally recognized contractor mutually acceptable to the parties, a written good faith estimate of the minimum cost and expense necessary to further investigate, remediate, cleanup, abate, restore, remove and otherwise address such Recognized Environmental Condition, Historical Recognized Environmental Condition, ACM or environmental contamination to the extent required by and in accordance with Environmental Laws and, to the extent required, to the satisfaction of any relevant Governmental Authority, assuming the continued commercial use of the relevant property and employing risk-based remedial standards and institutional controls where applicable (a “Remediation Estimate”). First

Choice shall provide to Enterprise any Remediation Estimate requested within five (5) business days of First Choice’s receipt thereof. First Choice shall, upon Enterprise’s reasonable request, cause all Remediation Estimates to be updated through the Closing Date. ( d )    Remediation Estimate Adjustment. Should the sum of all Remediation Estimates (to the extent the costs reflected in such estimates will or are reasonably expected to be incurred by First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary, and taking into account any tax credits, deductions or benefits or insurance coverage or contributions by landlords or other third parties, in each case, that the parties agree is reasonably likely to be available to First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary in connection with the incurrence of such costs) (such sum, the “Aggregate Remediation Estimate”) exceeds $3,000,000 in the aggregate (the “Remediation Deductible”), Enterprise may elect by written notice to adjust the original Exchange Ratio to a number equal to 0.6603 (i.e., the original Exchange Ratio), minus the Remediation Estimate Adjustment. The “Remediation Estimate Adjustment” is a number equal to the quotient, (A) the numerator of which is the product of (i) the amount by which the Aggregate Remediation Estimate exceeds the Remediation Deductible and (ii) 0.75 (i.e., 1 – a 25% tax rate), and (B) the denominator of which is the product of (i) 11,824,487 (i.e., the issued and outstanding shares of First Choice Common Stock as of March 31, 2021) and (ii) the Initial VWAP. An example of the calculation of the Remediation Estimate Adjustment and the resulting adjusted Exchange Ratio is set forth in Schedule 3. ( e )    Cooperation. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.18 to the contrary, First Choice shall keep Enterprise reasonably apprised of all activities and actions contemplated by this Section 5.18, and First Choice and Enterprise shall cooperate fully with one another with respect to the matters required by this Section 5.18. Section 5.19    Certain Litigation. First Choice shall promptly advise Enterprise orally and in writing of any actual or threatened Legal Proceeding against First Choice and/or the members of the First Choice Board related to this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. First Choice shall: (i) permit Enterprise to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of Enterprise in connection with, any proposed written or oral response to such Legal Proceeding; (ii) furnish Enterprise’s outside legal counsel with all non-privileged information and documents which outside counsel may reasonably request in connection with such Legal Proceeding; (iii) consult with Enterprise regarding the defense or settlement of any such Legal Proceeding, give due consideration to Enterprise’s advice with respect to such Legal Proceeding and not settle any such Legal Proceeding prior to such consultation and consideration; provided, however, that First Choice shall not settle any such Legal Proceeding if such settlement requires the payment of money damages, without the written consent of Enterprise (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the payment of any such damages by First Choice is reasonably expected by First Choice, following consultation with outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid by First Choice) under First Choice’s existing director and officer insurance policies, including any tail policy.

Section 5.21    Coordination. ( a )    Prior to the Effective Time, senior officers of First Choice and Enterprise shall meet from time to time as Enterprise may reasonably request, not less frequently than monthly, to prepare the parties for integration of the operations of First Choice and First Choice Bank with Enterprise and EB&T and to review the financial and operational affairs of First Choice and First Choice Subsidiaries, and First Choice shall give due consideration to Enterprise’s input on such matters, with the understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, neither Enterprise nor EB&T shall, under any circumstance, be permitted to exercise control of First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. First Choice shall permit representatives of Enterprise to be onsite at First Choice to facilitate integration of operations and assist with any other coordination efforts as necessary.

(e)    None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder, the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by Shareholder with any of the provisions hereof will conflict with or result in a breach, or constitute a default (with or without notice of lapse of time or both) under any provision of, any trust agreement, loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument or Law applicable to Shareholder or to Shareholder’s property or assets. (f)    No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or other Person on the part of Shareholder is required in connection with the valid execution and delivery of this Agreement or Shareholder’s performance of his, her or its obligations hereunder.

The proxy and power of attorney granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. 5 .    No Solicitation of Transactions. Except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by the Merger Agreement, and subject to Section 11 hereof, Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly (a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than Enterprise or any Enterprise Subsidiary) any information or data with respect to First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary or otherwise in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal or (c) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. 6 .

Further, this Section 7 shall not prohibit a surrender of Shares to First Choice in connection with the vesting or settlement of First Choice Stock Awards and/or First Choice Options to satisfy any withholding for the payment of taxes incurred in connection with such vesting or settlement. 8.

I hereby consent to the execution by my [spouse/domestic partner] of the Agreement and agree that I and any interest, including any community property interest, that I may have in any Shares of First Choice subject to the Agreement shall be irrevocably bound by the Agreement including any voting or other obligations as set forth in the Agreement. I hereby irrevocably appoint my [spouse/domestic partner] as my attorney-in-fact and agent with respect to the exercise of any rights and obligations under the Agreement. I agree that, in the event of divorce or the dissolution of my [marriage/partnership] to my present [spouse/domestic partner] or other legal division of property, I will transfer and sell, at the fair market value, to my [spouse/domestic partner] any and all interest I have or may acquire in First Choice, and I further agree that a court may award such entire interest to my [spouse/domestic partner] as part of any such legal division of property. The foregoing agreement is not intended as a waiver of any community property or other ownership interest I may have in the Shares of First Choice, but only as an agreement to accept other property or assets of substantially equivalent value as part of any property settlement agreement or other legal division of property upon divorce or the dissolution of my [marriage/partnership]. I agree not to directly or indirectly, transfer, sell, offer, exchange, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber (“ Transfer”) any interest I may have in the Shares of First Choice or enter into any contract, option or other agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of, any interest I may have in the Shares of First Choice, unless in connection with the above paragraph. I agree not to bequeath my interest, if any, in the Shares of First Choice, by will, trust, or any other testamentary disposition to any person other than my current [spouse/domestic partner]. Further, the residuary clause in my will shall not include my interest, if any, in the Shares of First Choice. This Consent shall be binding on my executors, administrators, heirs, and assigns. I agree to execute and deliver such documents as may be necessary to carry out the intent of the Agreement and this Consent. I am aware that the legal, financial, and related matters contained in the Agreement are complex and that I am free to seek independent professional guidance or counsel with respect to this Consent. I have either sought such guidance or counsel or determined after reviewing the

Agreement carefully that I will waive such right. I am under no disability or impairment that affects my decision to sign this Consent and I knowingly and voluntarily intend to be legally bound by this Consent. I consent to the delivery and transmission of this Consent (and the Voting Agreement, as applicable) by facsimile, by electronic mail, or by other electronic transmission, and to the use of portable document format (.pdf) or other electronic or facsimile format for this Consent and the Voting Agreement (as applicable). I agree that I will be legally bound by my Electronic Signature to this Consent (as such term is defined immediately below), and that my Electronic Signature shall be the legal equivalent of my manual signature. The term “Electronic Signature” means (a) my manual signature on this Consent, converted to facsimile or other digital form (such as a .pdf file) and sent from my customary email address, customary facsimile number, or other authenticated source mutually agreed- upon by me and my [spouse/domestic partner] or the designee of my [spouse/domestic partner]; or (b) my digital signature executed using the process provided by DocuSign Inc. I am satisfied with the terms of this Consent and I understand and have received full disclosure of all the rights that I am agreeing to waive. I hereby agree that my [spouse/domestic partner] may join in any future amendment, waiver, consent, or modification of the Agreement without any further signature, acknowledgment, agreement, or consent on my part or notice to me. Dated to be effective on [●], 2021.

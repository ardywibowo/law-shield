Meyer Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Kentucky corporation (“Merger Subsidiary”); and Kentucky Bancshares, Inc., a Kentucky corporation (“KTYB”). 


Recitals 


A. KTYB is a corporation organized and existing under the Kentucky Business Corporation Act (“KBCA”) that is duly registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). KTYB owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Kentucky Bank (“KY Bank”), which is a Kentucky banking corporation duly organized and existing as a bank under the Kentucky Financial Services Code (“KFSC”).

SYBT also owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Subsidiary, which is a corporation organized and existing under the KBCA. 


C. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties intend that at the Closing (as defined below), Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into KTYB, and as a result each issued and outstanding share of KTYB Common Stock (as defined below) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below). 


D. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and the Parent-Sub Merger, taken together, shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

F.  As an inducement for SYBT to enter into this Agreement, certain directors and/or shareholders of KTYB identified on Attachment A to the KTYB Disclosure Schedule (the “Specified KTYB Shareholders”) have entered into Support Agreements with SYBT (the “KTYB Support Agreements”), each dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A, pursuant to which each Specified KTYB Shareholder has agreed, among other matters, to vote all of the shares of KTYB Common Stock beneficially owned by the Specified KTYB Shareholder in favor of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the KTYB Support Agreement.

KTYB shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky








________________


until the Parent-Sub Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall terminate. 


Section 1.2 The Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will occur by electronic exchange of documents at 2:00 pm, Louisville, Kentucky time, on a date which is no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto (the “Closing Date”). 


Section 1.3 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the “Articles of Merger”) to be filed with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Kentucky on the Closing Date (the “Kentucky Secretary”). The term “Effective Time” shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger. 


Section 1.4 Effect of the Merger. 


(a) From and after the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the KBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of KTYB and Merger Subsidiary shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and duties of KTYB and Merger Subsidiary shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 


(b) At the Effective Time, (i) the Articles of Incorporation of KTYB shall be amended to be consistent with the Articles of Incorporation of the Merger Subsidiary (the “Merger Subsidiary Articles”), as in effect at the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) the Bylaws of KTYB shall be amended to be consistent with the Bylaws of the Merger Subsidiary (the “Merger Subsidiary Bylaws”), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. 


(c) The members of the Board of Directors of Merger Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the members of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time. 


(d) The officers of Merger Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time. 


Section 1.5 Conversion of KTYB Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of SYBT, KTYB, Merger Subsidiary or the holder of any of the following shares of capital stock: 


(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of common stock, no par value (the “KTYB Common Stock”), of KTYB issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares of KTYB Common Stock (A) owned by KTYB or SYBT (other than shares (x) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds or similar accounts, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (y) held, directly or indirectly, as a result of debts previously contracted) or (B) that are Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into (i) 0.64 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, no par value, of SYBT (the “SYBT Common Stock”) and (ii) the right to receive, without interest, $4.75 in cash (the “Per Share Cash Consideration” and, together with the shares of SYBT Common Stock referenced in clause (i), the “Merger Consideration”). 


(b) All of the shares of KTYB Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a “Certificate,” it being understood that any








________________


reference herein to “Certificate” shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of KTYB Common Stock) previously representing any shares of KTYB Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, including a certificate (it being understood that any reference herein to a “certificate” representing shares of SYBT Common Stock shall be deemed to include, unless the context otherwise requires, reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of SYBT Common Stock) representing the number of whole shares of SYBT Common Stock and the Per Share Cash Consideration which the applicable shares of KTYB Common Stock represented by the Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5(a), (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of KTYB Common Stock represented by the Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Certificates previously representing shares of KTYB Common Stock shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration and the other amounts specified in the immediately preceding sentence upon the surrender of the Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of SYBT Common Stock or KTYB Common Stock have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there has been any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration; provided, that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to permit KTYB or SYBT to take any action with respect to the outstanding shares of SYBT Common Stock or KTYB Common Stock, as applicable, that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 


(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of KTYB Common Stock that are owned by KTYB or SYBT (in each case other than shares (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds or similar accounts, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and cease to exist and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered or exchanged therefor. 


(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of KTYB Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by persons who have properly exercised, and not withdrawn or waived, appraisal rights with respect thereto (“Dissenting Shares”) in accordance with the KBCA will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but will be entitled in lieu thereof to receive payment of the fair value of their Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of the KBCA unless and until the holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the KBCA. If, after the Effective Time, any holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses their rights referred to in the preceding sentence, the applicable holder’s shares of KTYB Common Stock will thereupon be treated as if the shares had been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. KTYB will give SYBT prompt notice of any notices of intent to demand payment under the KBCA received by KTYB with respect to shares of KTYB Common Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, KTYB will not, except with the prior written consent of SYBT, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any demands referred to in this Section 1.5(d). 


Section 1.6 Treatment of Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each award of a share of KTYB Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (a “KTYB Restricted Stock Award”), whether vested or unvested, that was outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and be cancelled and converted automatically (without any further action on part of the applicable holder) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of KTYB Common Stock underlying the KTYB Restricted Stock Award. SYBT shall issue the consideration described in this Section 1.6 (together with the cash payment of any accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to the SYBT Common Stock) corresponding to KTYB Restricted Stock Awards that vest in accordance with this Section 1.6, less applicable Tax withholdings, in a manner consistent with the procedures for all other shares of KTYB Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth in Section 2.2 of this Agreement; provided, that with respect to any shares in respect of a KTYB Restricted Stock Award that the applicable holder duly elects to be withheld for purposes of paying any applicable Tax withholding (“Withheld Restricted Shares”), the Withheld Restricted Shares shall be deemed not issued and outstanding shares of KTYB Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and at all times thereafter). At or prior to the Effective Time, KTYB, the Board of Directors of








________________


KTYB and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6. 


Section 1.7 SYBT Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of SYBT Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of SYBT and shall not be affected by the Merger. 


Section 1.8 Merger Subsidiary Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary, no par value per share (the “Merger Subsidiary Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 


Section 1.9 Parent-Sub Merger. Following the Merger, SYBT currently intends to cause the Surviving Corporation to be merged with and into SYBT pursuant to a short-form, parent-subsidiary merger in accordance with Section 271B.11-040 of the KBCA (the “Parent-Sub Merger”), with SYBT surviving the Parent-Sub Merger and continuing to exist under the name “Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc.” SYBT anticipates that the Parent-Sub Merger will occur immediately after the occurrence of the Merger. Following the Parent-Sub Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease. 


Section 1.10 Bank Merger. Immediately following the Parent-Sub Merger, or at such later time as SYBT may determine, KY Bank will merge with and into SY Bank (the “Bank Merger”). SY Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of KY Bank shall cease. The Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Bank Merger, in a form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B (the “Bank Merger Agreement”). KTYB shall cause KY Bank, and SYBT shall cause SY Bank, to execute all articles of merger and all other agreements, documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (“Bank Merger Certificates”) immediately following the Merger or at a later time as SYBT may determine. 


ARTICLE II EXCHANGE OF SHARES 


Section 2.1 Availability of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, SYBT shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a third party exchange agent (who is reasonably acceptable to SYBT and KTYB) (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (i) certificates or, at SYBT’s option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to herein as “certificates”), representing the shares of SYBT Common Stock to be issued to holders of KTYB Common Stock, (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration, and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares (the cash and certificates for shares of SYBT Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of KTYB Common Stock. 


Section 2.2 Exchange of Shares. 


(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, SYBT shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of KTYB Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal in a form reasonably acceptable to SYBT and KTYB (the “Letter of Transmittal”). The Letter of Transmittal will contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares) which the shares of KTYB Common Stock represented by the Certificate or Certificates have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Except with respect to Dissenting Shares, upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with the properly completed Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, the holder of the Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of SYBT Common Stock to which the holder of KTYB Common Stock has become entitled pursuant to the provisions of








________________


Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of KTYB Common Stock represented by the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and (B) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Per Share Cash Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2. 


(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to SYBT Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender the Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which had become payable with respect to the whole shares of SYBT Common Stock which the shares of KTYB Common Stock represented by the applicable Certificate have been converted into the right to receive. 


(c) If any certificate representing shares of SYBT Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance of the certificate representing shares of SYBT Common Stock that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting the exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of SYBT Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that the Tax has been paid or is not payable. 


(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of KTYB of the shares of KTYB Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing shares of KTYB Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in this Article II, as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). 


(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of SYBT Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to SYBT Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of SYBT. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional share, SYBT shall pay to each former shareholder of KTYB who otherwise would be entitled to receive the fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of SYBT Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading days ending on the trading day preceding the Closing Date (“SYBT Common Stock Closing Price”) by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of SYBT Common Stock which the holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for-consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for the purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. 


(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of KTYB as of the date that is twelve (12) months after the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the “Final Claim Date”) shall be paid to SYBT. Any former shareholder of KTYB that has not prior to the Final Claim Date complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to SYBT for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on SYBT Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of KTYB Common Stock the former shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of SYBT, KTYB, the Surviving Corporation, the








________________


Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of KTYB Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 


(g) Each of SYBT and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement all amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of the consideration payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by SYBT or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts (i) will be paid over by SYBT or the Exchange Agent to the appropriate governmental authority and (ii) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made. 


(h) In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by SYBT, the posting by person claiming of a bond in an amount as SYBT may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against SYBT with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 


ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF KTYB 


Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by KTYB to SYBT concurrently herewith (the “KTYB Disclosure Schedule”); provided that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the KTYB Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by KTYB that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections, or (b) as disclosed in any KTYB Reports publicly filed with or furnished to the SEC by KTYB after January 1, 2019 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading “Risk Factors,” or disclosures of risks set forth in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), KTYB hereby represents and warrants to SYBT as follows: 


Section 3.1 Corporate Organization. 


(a) KTYB is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and is a financial holding company duly registered with the FRB under the BHC Act. KTYB has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects. KTYB is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on KTYB. As used in this Agreement, the word “Subsidiary” shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Section 2(d) of the BHC Act. True and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of KTYB (the “KTYB Articles”), and the Bylaws of KTYB, as amended (the “KTYB Bylaws”), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by KTYB to SYBT. 


(b) Except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) only, as would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on KTYB, each Subsidiary of KTYB (a “KTYB Subsidiary”) (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, or local) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, and (iii) has all requisite corporate other applicable entity power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now

conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any KTYB Subsidiary to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a KTYB Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all similar regulated entities.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than 45 days after the date of this Agreement, SYBT and KTYB shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required to be filed with any bank regulatory agency in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. SYBT and KTYB shall each use, and shall each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Requisite Regulatory Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. SYBT and KTYB shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the non-confidential portions of all the information relating to KTYB or SYBT, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 


(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of SYBT and KTYB shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require SYBT or KTYB to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SYBT and the SYBT Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (a “Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition”). 


(d) SYBT and KTYB shall, upon request, furnish each other with information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of SYBT, KTYB or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 


(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, SYBT and KTYB shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes the receiving party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any Requisite Regulatory Approval will be materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the “Requisite Regulatory Approvals” shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals from (i) the FRB, the FDIC and the KDFI, and (ii) any other approvals set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, or those other authorizations, consents, orders or approvals the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SYBT. 


Section 5.5 Access to Information.








________________


(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of SYBT and KTYB, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, each of SYBT and KTYB shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents that SYBT or KTYB, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither SYBT nor KTYB nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of SYBT’s or KTYB’s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of the information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 


(b) Each of SYBT and KTYB shall hold (and cause their respective Subsidiaries, and the respective officers, directors, managers, representatives, and employees of each of them, to hold) all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of the party’s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or otherwise in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Mutual Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation Agreement, dated February 12, 2020, between SYBT and KTYB (the “Non- Disclosure Agreement”). SYBT and KTYB acknowledge and agree that the Non-Disclosure Agreement remains in full force and effect. 


(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations. 


Section 5.6 Approval of KTYB Shareholders. 


(a) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII, the Board of Directors of KTYB shall submit to its shareholders this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved or voted upon by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. KTYB shall duly take, in accordance with applicable law and the KTYB Articles and KTYB Bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC (the “KTYB Meeting”). Except as otherwise required in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or in the case of a Change of Recommendation specifically permitted by, and in compliance with, Section 5.14(h), the Board of Directors of KTYB shall (i) include its recommendation to the KTYB shareholders that the KTYB shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein (the “Board Recommendation”) in the Proxy Statement, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite KTYB Vote. 


(b) Except as set forth in Section 5.14(h), neither the Board of Directors of KTYB nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to SYBT, the Board Recommendation or take any action, or make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with the Board Recommendation (any of the foregoing being a “Change in Recommendation”); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, KTYB may not effect a Change in Recommendation unless it has complied in all material respects with the provisions of Section 5.14(h).

Section 5.7 Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 5.4 of this Agreement, each of SYBT and KTYB shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on the party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VI, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by KTYB or SYBT or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 


Section 5.8 Employee Matters. 


(a) Except for specific benefit plans otherwise addressed in this Section 5.8, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, SYBT shall provide each employee of KTYB and its Subsidiaries who at SYBT’s discretion continues to be employed by SYBT or the SYBT Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing Employees”) with compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the lesser of (i) compensation and employee benefits provided prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) compensation and employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of SYBT and the SYBT Subsidiaries; such that, until such time as the Continuing Employees commence participating in SYBT plans and programs, the foregoing obligations shall be deemed satisfied by the Continuing Employees’ continued level of compensation and participation in KTYB Benefits Plans, or a mixture of SYBT benefit plans and KTYB Benefit Plans, as the case may be for transition or termination of each such plan or program, it being understood that participation in SYBT plans and programs may commence at different times. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive Fringe Benefits shall not be included as compensation or employee benefits to be provided to the Continuing Employees; rather, SYBT shall provide such fringe benefits and perquisites as it determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate for any of the Continuing Employees. 


(b) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by SYBT, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, KTYB or a KTYB Subsidiary shall cause to be amended any KTYB Benefit Plan to the extent necessary to provide that no employee of SYBT shall continue or commence participation therein following the Effective Time. 


(c) KTYB will use commercially reasonable best efforts to assist SYBT in obtaining on or prior to the Effective Time each Continuing Employee’s agreement to SYBT’s (or a SYBT Subsidiary’s) standard non-solicitation and other standard agreements required by SYBT (or any SYBT Subsidiary) of newly-hired employees (“Continuing Employee Agreements”). 


(d) Unless otherwise addressed in an employment agreement entered into with SYBT or SY Bank or an existing employment, severance, or change in control agreement with KTYB or KY Bank, SYBT shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to those employees of KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries, as of the Effective Time (i) who SYBT or its subsidiaries elect not to employ after the Effective Time or who become Continuing Employees but are terminated by SYBT or any SYBT Subsidiary other than for cause within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, and (ii) who sign and deliver SYBT’s standard form of termination, release, and non-solicitation agreement, a severance payment (payable, net of deductions, in a lump-sum payment after satisfaction within 60 days thereof of the applicable conditions for such payment) equal to two (2) weeks of pay, at their base rate of pay in effect at the time of termination, for each full year of continuous service with KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries and their successors, up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks. 


(e) With respect to any SYBT Benefit Plans in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, SYBT shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the applicable Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under the SYBT Benefit Plans, except to the extent the waiting periods would apply under the analogous KTYB Benefit Plan, and (ii) recognize all service of the applicable Continuing Employees with KTYB and the KTYB Subsidiaries for all purposes in any SYBT Benefit Plan to the same extent that the service was taken into account under the analogous KTYB Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same








________________


period of services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan, or (C) for purposes of any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits. 


(f) If requested by SYBT in writing at least twenty (20) business days prior to the Effective Time, KTYB shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by KTYB or any of its Subsidiaries (the “KTYB 401(k) Plan”) to be terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that SYBT requests that any KTYB 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in the Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “SY Bank KSOP”). KTYB and SYBT shall take any and all actions as may be required to permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions to the SY Bank KSOP of “eligible rollover distributions” (with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof. KTYB shall provide SYBT with evidence that the KTYB 401(k) Plan has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 5.8(f); provided, that prior to amending or terminating the KTYB 401(k) Plan, KTYB shall provide the form and substance of any applicable resolutions or amendments to SYBT for review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 


(g) On and after the date hereof, any broad-based employee notices or communication materials (including any website posting) directed by either party to employees of KTYB or any KTYB Subsidiary with respect to employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and comment of the other party, and the party seeking to distribute the notice or communication shall consider in good faith revising the notice or communication to reflect any comments or advice that the other party timely and reasonably provides. 


(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, director or consultant of KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of SYBT, KTYB, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of KTYB, SYBT or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, director or consultant of KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause (subject to the provisions of Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of this Agreement). Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any KTYB Benefit Plan, SYBT Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of SYBT or any of the SYBT Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular KTYB Benefit Plan, SYBT Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 8.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including, without limitation, any current or former employee, director or consultant of KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 


(i) KTYB will, or will cause the appropriate KTYB Subsidiary (as applicable) to, unilaterally take action prior to Closing to terminate the right under its major illness sick leave program for employees to be paid the cash value of a part of any unused leave in the event of a termination of employment that occurs after a designated retirement age, and will pay all amounts for which retirement-eligible employees are vested at the date of Closing within the time required under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix). 


Section 5.9 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. 


(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, SYBT shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and former director and officer of KTYB and the KTYB Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “KTYB Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that the person is or was a director or officer of KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions








________________


contemplated by this Agreement; and SYBT shall also advance expenses as incurred by such KTYB Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; provided that the KTYB Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such KTYB Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. SYBT shall reasonably cooperate with the KTYB Indemnified Party, and KTYB Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with SYBT, in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation contemplated by this Section 5.10(a). 


(b) SYBT will obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year “tail” policy (a “Tail Policy”) under KTYB’s existing policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) providing coverage with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) if and to the extent that the Tail Policy may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by KTYB for D&O Insurance (the “Premium Cap”) (and if the premiums for the Tail Policy would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then SYBT shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in SYBT’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap). SYBT shall maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. 


(c) The obligations of SYBT and KTYB under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any KTYB Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 5.9 without the prior written consent of the affected KTYB Indemnified Party or affected person. 


(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each KTYB Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If SYBT or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of the consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then in each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9 are not otherwise transferred and assumed by the successors and assigns by operation of law or otherwise, SYBT will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of SYBT expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. 


Section 5.10 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest SYBT or the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger or the Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by SYBT. 


Section 5.11 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of SYBT and KTYB shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends in respect of SYBT Common Stock and KTYB Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of KTYB Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of KTYB Common Stock and any shares of SYBT Common Stock any holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 


Section 5.12 Advice of Changes; Disclosure Supplements. 


(a) SYBT and KTYB (for purposes of this Section 5.12, the “Notifying Party”) shall each promptly advise the other party of any change or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Notifying Party or (ii) which the Notifying Party believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of the Notifying Party’s representations, warranties or covenants contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, either individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in, if SYBT is the Notifying Party, Section 6.1 or Section 6.3, or if KTYB is the Notifying Party, Section 6.1 or Section 6.2; provided that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 5.12 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to








________________


give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 to be satisfied. 


(b) KTYB and SYBT shall each promptly supplement, amend and update, upon the occurrence of any change prior to the Effective Time, and as of the Effective Time, the KTYB Disclosure Schedule and the SYBT Disclosure Schedule (as applicable) with respect to any matters or events hereafter arising which, if in existence or having occurred as of the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the KTYB Disclosure Schedule or the SYBT Disclosure Schedule (as applicable) or this Agreement and including, without limitation, any fact which, if existing or known as of the date hereof, would have made any of the representations or warranties of KTYB or SYBT (as applicable) contained herein materially incorrect, untrue or misleading. No supplement, amendment or update to the KTYB Disclosure Schedule or SYBT Disclosure Schedule (as applicable) shall (i) cure any breach of a representation or warranty existing as of the date of this Agreement or any breach of a covenant in this Agreement after the execution of this Agreement; or (ii) affect a party's rights with respect to termination under Article VII of this Agreement. 


Section 5.13 SYBT Board of Directors.  It is the intent of SYBT to identify two members of the KTYB Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement to be added as members of the SYBT Board of Directors and SY Bank Board of Directors after the Effective Time, at SYBT’s discretion and subject to SYBT’s and SY Bank’s corporate governance practices and policies and applicable law. 


Section 5.14 No Solicitation; Change of Recommendation. 


(a) KTYB agrees that, except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.14, from and after the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, neither it nor any of the KTYB Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of KTYB, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.14(a); (iv) approve, endorse, recommend, execute or enter into any agreement, letter of intent or contract with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise relating to or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement which expressly permits KTYB to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.14 and that contains provisions no less favorable or protective than as set forth in the Non-Disclosure Agreement) or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) submit any Acquisition Proposal or any matter related thereto to the vote of the shareholders of KTYB other than this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; or (vi) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal. 


(b) As used in this Agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of KTYB and the KTYB Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of KTYB or the KTYB Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of KTYB, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in the applicable third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of KTYB or the KTYB Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of KTYB, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving KTYB or the KTYB Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of KTYB. 


(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent KTYB or its Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making any legally required disclosure to








________________


KTYB’s shareholders if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with KTYB’s outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (iii) in response to an Acquisition Proposal, informing the person making the Acquisition Proposal of the existence of this Section 5.14, or (iv) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the KTYB’s shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar permitted or required communication to the shareholders of KTYB); provided that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 


(d) KTYB agrees that it shall immediately, and shall instruct its Representatives to immediately, cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. KTYB agrees that it shall take the necessary steps to inform promptly the individuals or entities referred to in the immediately preceding sentence of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.14 and in the Non-Disclosure Agreement. KTYB also agrees that is shall promptly request each person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring KTYB or any of the KTYB Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries. 


(e) KTYB agrees that it shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours of receiving the relevant information) notify SYBT if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be initiated or continued with, KTYB or any of its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such person, and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, complete and unredacted copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep SYBT informed, on a current basis (and, in any event, no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations), of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in KTYB’s intentions as previously notified. 


(f) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite KTYB Vote is obtained, KTYB may (i) provide information in response to a request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from any breach by KTYB, the KTYB Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives of this Section 5.14, providing for the acquisition of more than 20% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total voting power of the equity securities of KTYB if KTYB receives from the person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party than those contained in the Non-Disclosure Agreement and which expressly permits KTYB to comply with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.14; and promptly discloses (and, if applicable, provide copies of) any such information to SYBT to the extent not previously provided to SYBT; (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal as described in clause (i) of this Section 5.14(f) above; or (iii) after having complied with Section 5.14(h), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) an Acquisition Proposal as described in clause (i) of this Section 5.14(f), if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in order for such directors to comply with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (y) in each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation with KTYB’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (iii) above, the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Requisite KTYB Vote, the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may make a Change of Recommendation (and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)) if: 


(i) KTYB has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any person that is not withdrawn and that the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) concludes in good faith and in compliance with the requirements of Section 5.14(f) constitutes a Superior Proposal, and: 


(A) the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable laws; 


(B)  KTYB shall have complied in all material respects with all of its obligations under this Section 5.14; and 


(C) (1) KTYB shall have provided prior written notice to SYBT at least six (6) business days in advance (the “Notice Period”), to the effect that the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has concluded in good faith that a Superior Proposal has been received and, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has resolved to effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this Section 5.14(h) (and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)), which notice shall specify the basis for such Change in Recommendation, including the identity of the person or group of persons making the Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal; 


(2) prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation (or termination pursuant to Section 7.1(f)), (aa) KTYB shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with SYBT and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent SYBT desires to negotiate) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and permit SYBT and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent SYBT desires to make such presentation), and (bb) at the end of the Notice Period the Board of Directors of KTYB (or a duly authorized committee thereof) again makes the determination in good faith (i) after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation (or authorize the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f)) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (ii) taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by SYBT, that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior

(c) by either SYBT or KTYB if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before January 1, 2022 (the “Outside Date”), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by the Outside Date shall be due primarily to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of the seeking party set forth herein and such failure has caused or resulted in either (i) the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Article VI prior to the Outside Date, or (ii) the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or prior to the Outside Date;

(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither SYBT nor KTYB shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination. 


(b) In the event that: 


(i) 


(1) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management or the Board of Directors of KTYB or has been made directly to the KTYB shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and, in each case, not unconditionally withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to KTYB, and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either SYBT or KTYB pursuant to Section 7.1(c) without the Requisite KTYB Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and Section 6.3 had been satisfied or were capable of being satisfied at a time prior to the termination), or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either SYBT or KTYB pursuant to Section 7.1(d), or (C) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by SYBT pursuant to Section 7.1(e) as a result of a willful breach; AND 


 (2) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of the termination of this Agreement, KTYB enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then KTYB shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into the definitive agreement and the date of consummation of the transaction, pay SYBT, by wire transfer of same day funds (to an account designated in writing by SYBT), a fee equal to $7,250,000 (the “Termination Fee”); 


(ii) this Agreement is terminated by KTYB or SYBT pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then KTYB shall pay SYBT, by wire transfer of same day funds (to an account designated in writing by SYBT), the Termination Fee no later than two (2) business days after the termination of this Agreement; 


(iii) this Agreement is terminated by SYBT or KTYB pursuant to Section 7.1(d) (other than a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d) that is subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(b)(i) of this Agreement, in which event the Termination Fee shall be the only payment required under this Article VII), then KTYB shall reimburse SYBT for all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses (up to a maximum of $1,800,000) incurred by SYBT in connection with this Agreement, by wire transfer of same day funds (to an account designated in writing by SYBT), no later than two (2) business days after the termination of this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will KTYB be required to pay both the Termination Fee and the reimbursement contemplated under Section 7.2(b)(iii). 


(d) KTYB acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, SYBT would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if KTYB fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain the payment SYBT commences a suit which results in a judgment against KTYB for payment of any such amount, KTYB shall pay the costs and expenses of SYBT (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with the suit. In addition, if KTYB fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 7.2, then KTYB shall pay interest on the overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that the overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that the overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” (as published in the Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date on which the payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that the overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement, shall be (together with the amounts specified in this Section 7.2(d)) the sole monetary remedy of SYBT in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in the section under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable and is paid in full.

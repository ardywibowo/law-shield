AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 


THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (together with all exhibits and schedules, this “Agreement”) is entered into as of June 22, 2021, by and between Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (“Nicolet”), and County Bancorp, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the “Company”). RECITALS A. The parties to this Agreement desire to effect a merger of the Company with and into Nicolet (the “Merger”) in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the WBCL, with Nicolet as the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Entity”). B. The respective boards of directors of the Company and Nicolet have approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the WBCL, approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement and determined that consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is in the best interests of their respective companies and shareholders. C. The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a “reorganization” under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated thereunder. D. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the parties also agree to certain prescribed conditions to the Merger and other transactions. E. The Company wishes to transfer to Nicolet, and Nicolet wishes to assume, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein: (i) certain assets and certain liabilities related to the trust preferred securities (the “Company Trust Preferred Securities”) issued by the Company Trusts; (ii) the obligations of the Company pursuant to the subordinated notes issued by the Company to the Company Trusts (such obligations, the “Company Trust Debentures”); and (iii) the obligations of the Company pursuant to the subordinated notes issued by the Company pursuant to the Company Subordinated Note Indentures. AGREEMENTS In consideration of the foregoing premises and the following mutual promises, covenants and agreements, the parties hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1 THE MERGER 


Section 1.1    The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the WBCL, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Nicolet pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effects provided in, the WBCL, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Nicolet will be the Surviving Entity. Section 1.2    Effective Time; Closing. (a)    The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall occur through the mail, by the exchange of documents electronically, or at a place that is mutually acceptable to Nicolet and the Company, or if they fail to agree, at the offices of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP, 1201 W. Peachtree Street, 14  Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at such other time and place as Nicolet and the Company may agree in writing (the “Closing Date”). Subject to the provisions of Article 10, failure to consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.2 will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this Agreement.

Section 1.6    Location of the Surviving Entity. The principal offices of the Surviving Entity will be located at 111 N. Washington Street, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301. Section 1.7    Bank Merger. Following the Effective Time of the Merger, the Bank shall be merged with and into Nicolet Bank in accordance with the provisions of the National Bank Act (12 U.S.C. § 215a), Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Subchapter VII of the Wisconsin Banking Law and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan of Merger by and between Nicolet Bank and the Bank, a form of which is attached as Exhibit A (the “Bank Plan of Merger”).

Section 1.8    TRUPS and Subordinated Notes Assumption. As of the Effective Time and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein: (a) Nicolet will assume and discharge (i) all of the Company’s covenants, agreements and obligations under and relating to the Company Trust Preferred Securities, including (ii) the due and punctual payment of interest on all of the obligations of the Company pursuant to the Company Trust Debentures, and such transfer and assumption as described in clauses (i) and (ii), the “TRUPS Assumption”); (b) Nicolet will assume and discharge all of the Company’s covenants, agreements and obligations, including the due and punctual payment of interest, under and relating to the Company Subordinated Note Indentures (such transfer and assumption, the “Subordinated Notes Assumption”); (c) Nicolet will cause each of the Company Trusts to discharge its obligations with respect to the Company Trust Preferred Securities arising after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreements related to the Company Trust Preferred Securities and the TRUPS Assumption; (d) Nicolet shall discharge its obligations with regard to the Company Subordinated Note Indentures arising after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreements related to the Company Subordinated Note Indentures and the Subordinated Notes Assumption; (e) Nicolet and the Company shall execute and deliver, or cause to be delivered, one or more supplemental indentures, in a form satisfactory to the applicable trustee, to effectuate the TRUPS Assumption, for each Company Trust and the Subordinated Notes Assumption, whereby the Company shall assign, and Nicolet shall assume, all of the Company’s covenants, agreements and obligations under the Company Trust Debentures and the Company Subordinated Note Indentures (the “Supplemental Indentures”), signed by a duly authorized officer of each of the Company and Nicolet, and any and all other documentation and consents, including opinions of counsel, required by the trustee to make such assumptions effective. Section 1.9    Absence of Control. Subject to any specific provisions of this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that neither Nicolet nor the Company by reason of this Agreement shall be deemed

________________


(until consummation of the Merger) to control, directly or indirectly, the other party or any of its respective Subsidiaries and shall not exercise, or be deemed to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of such other party or any of its respective Subsidiaries. Section 1.10    Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Nicolet may change the method of effecting the Contemplated Transactions if and to the extent that it concludes such a change to be desirable; provided, that: (a) any such change shall not affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as consideration in the Merger or (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger. If Nicolet elects to make such a change, the parties shall execute appropriate documents to reflect the change. ARTICLE 2 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER 


Section 2.1    Consideration. (a)    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Nicolet, the Company, or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted, subject to the election and allocation procedures in Section 2.3 and the fractional share procedures in Section 2.5, into the right to receive either: (i)    0.48 fully paid and nonassessable shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Nicolet Common Stock (the “Per Share Stock Consideration”), or (ii)    Cash in the amount of $37.18 per share (the “Per Share Cash Consideration”). (b)    The total cash and stock consideration to be paid by Nicolet in respect of shares of Company Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Merger Consideration.” Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.1 to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held in the Company’s treasury and each share of Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Nicolet (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously contracted) will be cancelled and no shares of Nicolet Common Stock, cash, or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor. Section 2.2    Exchange of Company Stock Certificates. (a)    The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare Trust Company, N.A. shall serve, pursuant to customary terms of an exchange agent agreement, as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the “Exchange Agent”); and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent agreement at or prior to the Effective Time. Nicolet shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. (b)    At or prior to the Effective Time, Nicolet shall authorize the issuance of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (i) a sufficient number of shares of Nicolet Common Stock and cash for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, and (ii) sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.5. Such amount of cash and shares of Nicolet Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to in this Article 2 as the “Conversion Fund.” (c)    Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Nicolet shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates or evidence of book-entry representing such shares of Company Common Stock (the “Company Stock Certificates”) who did not tender such Company Stock Certificate(s) on or before the Election Deadline pursuant to Section 2.3 the letter of transmittal and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Stock

(d)    Upon the later of the Effective Time and proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Merger Consideration as allocated per Section 2.3 plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.5 deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate; thereupon such Company Stock Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled.

(g)    No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Nicolet Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2. Promptly after the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Nicolet Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were converted at the Effective Time pursuant t o Section 2.1. No holder of an unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Nicolet Common Stock into which such holder’s Company Common Stock shall have been converted. (h)    Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Outstanding Company Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any holders of Outstanding Company Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest, for issuance of Nicolet Common Stock and/or cash pursuant to the Merger Consideration and the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such shareholders’ shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Nicolet Common Stock.

(i)    In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with this Article 2, shares of Nicolet Common Stock and/or cash pursuant to the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. (j)    If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Nicolet Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration per share shall be adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Section 2.3    Election and Allocation Procedures. (a)    Election. Subject to the limitations set forth below, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be provided an opportunity, (i) to elect to receive Nicolet Common Stock with respect to all of

such holder’s Company Common Stock (a “Stock Election”); (ii) to elect to receive cash with respect to all of such holder’s Company Common Stock (a “Cash Election”); (iii) to elect to receive cash with respect to a portion of such holder’s Company Common Stock and shares of Nicolet Common Stock with respect to such holder’s remaining shares (a “Mixed Election”); or (iv) to indicate that such holder makes no such election with respect to such holder’s shares of Company Common Stock (a “Non-Election”). Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Cash Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein as “Cash Election Shares.” Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein as “Stock Election Shares.” Shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Non-Election or no election has been made are referred to herein as “No-Election Shares.” (i)    Nicolet and the Company shall cause to be mailed an election form, Letter of Transmittal and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent) (collectively, the “Election Form” ) with or following the issuance of the Joint Proxy Statement to each holder of record of Company Common Stock. Nicolet and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible an Election Form to any shareholder of the Company who requests such Election Form following the initial mailing of the Election Form and prior to the Election Deadline (as defined below). Each Election Form shall permit a holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instruction) of Company Common Stock to make a Stock Election, Cash Election, Mixed Election or Non-Election. Nominee record holders who hold Company Common Stock on behalf of multiple beneficial owners shall indicate how many of such shares held by them are Stock Election Shares, Cash Election Shares and No-Election Shares based upon the actions of the beneficial owners thereof. (ii)    Any shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which the holder shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective, properly completed, Election Form prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Business Day that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time (or such other time and date as Nicolet and the Company may mutually agree) (the “Election Deadline”) shall be treated as No-Election Shares. (iii)    Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline, together with all required accompanying documentation, Company Stock Certificates, and duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form, all as described in the instructions to the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form (or the beneficial owner of the shares covered by such Election Form through appropriate and customary documentation and instruction) at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline and no other valid election is made, the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall be No-Election Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Nicolet, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. (b)    Allocation. As soon as practicable after the Election Deadline, Nicolet shall cause the Exchange Agent to allocate the Merger Consideration among the holders of Company Common Stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of this Section. In order to ensure that the limits specified with respect to the cash consideration specified below are not exceeded, the parties hereby agree that the Exchange Agent, in applying the allocation rules set forth herein, shall have reasonable discretion to round calculations or otherwise adjust results thereof in order to accomplish such purpose, and each good faith determination made by the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. (i)    Cash Consideration Undersubscribed. If the number of Cash Election Shares is less than or equal to 1,237,000 (the “Cash Election Threshold”), then, at the Effective Time: (A) each Cash Election Share will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

________________


(B) No-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares to the extent necessary to have the total number of Cash Election Shares equal the Cash Election Threshold. If less than all of the No-Election Shares are so required to be treated as Cash Election Shares, then the Exchange Agent shall convert, on a pro rata basis, a sufficient number of No-Election Shares into Cash Election Shares, with all remaining No-Election Shares treated as Stock Election Shares; (C) If all of the No-Election Shares are converted to Cash Election Shares under the preceding subsection and the total number of Cash Election Shares remains below the Cash Election Threshold, then the Exchange Agent shall convert, on a pro rata basis, a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares into Cash Election Shares (the “Reallocated Cash Election Shares” ) such that the sum of the number of Cash Election Shares plus the Reallocated Cash Election Shares equals the Cash Election Threshold and each Reallocated Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and (D) each Stock Election Share which is not a Reallocated Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration. (ii)    Cash Consideration Oversubscribed. If the number of Cash Election Shares is greater than the Cash Election Threshold, then, at the Effective Time: (A) each Stock Election Share and No-Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; (B) the Exchange Agent shall convert, on a pro rata basis, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares into Stock Election Shares (the “Reallocated Stock Election Shares”) such that the number of remaining Cash Election Shares does not exceed the Cash Election Threshold and all Reallocated Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and (C) each Cash Election Share which is not a Reallocated Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration. Section 2.4    Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, the shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Company Stock Certificates that represented Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of Nicolet Common Stock or cash into which they were converted pursuant to this Article 2. Section 2.5    No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Nicolet Common Stock shall be issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Nicolet Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2 shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying Nicolet Common Stock Price by the fractional share of Nicolet Common Stock to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled. Section 2.6    Company Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Nicolet, the Company, or the holder of any shares of Company Preferred Stock, each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, will be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the redemption price of such Company Preferred Stock as of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the shares of Company Preferred Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Stock certificates that represented Company Preferred Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to represent cash into which they were converted pursuant to this Article 2. Section 2.7    Nicolet Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Nicolet, the Company, or the holder of any shares of Nicolet Common Stock, the shares of Nicolet Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

During the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock issued under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Restricted Stock Award ”) that is then subject to forfeiture or other restrictions shall become vested as a result of the Merger. Each vested Company Restricted Stock Award shall be exchanged as the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with this Article 2, treating each such Company Restricted Stock Award as a No-Election Share under Section  2.3. If applicable, the Company will ensure that all withholding Taxes attributable to the vesting of the Company Restricted Stock Award are properly paid and reported. (c)    Company Restricted Stock Units. During the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units issued under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Restricted Stock Unit”), whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be (i) fully vested and settled per the terms of the award and the applicable Company Stock Plan or (ii) cancelled in consideration for the right to receive the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to such cancellation, and in either case which shall then be exchanged in accordance this Article 2, treating each share of Company Common Stock received in settlement or cancellation of the Company Restricted Stock Unit as a No-Election Share under Section 2.3. If applicable, the Company will ensure that all withholding Taxes attributable to the vesting of the Company Restricted Stock Unit are properly paid and reported. ( d )    Company Deferred Restricted Stock Units. During the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the Effective Time, each award of deferred restricted stock units issued under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Deferred Restricted Stock Unit”), whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled (as permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B)), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to receive the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Deferred Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to such cancellation, which shall then be exchanged in accordance this Article 2, treating each share of Company Common Stock received in cancellation of the Company Deferred Restricted Stock Unit as a No-Election Share under Section 2.3.

The Company SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Company SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

The Company Financial Statements do not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities, absolute or contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would render the Company Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein.

________________


Company is required to file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the Company Capitalization Date, to the Knowledge of the Company, such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance. (d)    The Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) (“Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”). The Company’s certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or annual report on Form 10-K for the fourth quarter, under the Exchange Act (the “Company Evaluation Date”). The Company presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Company Evaluation Date. Since the Company Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Company has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. (e)    The Company Regulatory Reports have been filed with the appropriate Regulatory Authority. The Company Regulatory Reports have been prepared in material compliance with the rules and regulations of the respective federal or state banking regulator with which they were filed, except as otherwise noted therein. Each Company Regulatory Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company or the Bank, as appropriate, and the results of its operations at the date and for the period indicated in such Company Regulatory Report in conformity with the Instructions for the Preparation of Call Reports and other relevant guidance as promulgated by applicable Regulatory Authorities. None of the Company Regulatory Reports contains any material items of special or nonrecurring income or any other income not earned in the Ordinary Course of Business (it being understood that income relating to the Paycheck Protection Program is deemed earned in the Ordinary Course of Business), except as expressly specified therein.

No Company Benefit Plan provides for payment of any amount which, considered in the aggregate with amounts payable pursuant to all other Company Benefit Plans, would reasonably be expected to result in any amount being non-deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code. Section 3.12(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth the name of each Person who is or would be entitled pursuant to any Contract relating to employment or other services to the Company or the Bank or Company Benefit Plan to receive any payment from the Bank as a result of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (including any payment that is or would be due as a result of any actual or constructive termination of a Person’s employment or position following such consummation) and the maximum amount of such payment.

(e)    Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, each Company Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal Requirements.

To the Company’s Knowledge, no party in interest (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Company Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited transaction (as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406). (h)    As required in accordance with GAAP, all accrued contributions and other payments to be made by the Company or any Subsidiary to any Company Benefit Plan (i) through the date hereof have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes have been set aside therefor and reflected in the Company Financial Statements, and (ii) through the Closing Date will have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes will have been set aside therefor.

From and after the Closing Date, Nicolet would have the same discretion to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan as successor to Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, any third party agreement pertaining to the maintenance of a Company Benefit Plan may be terminated upon the provision of ninety (90) days’ prior notice or less without penalty.

Section 3.27    Bank Secrecy Act; PATRIOT Act; Anti-Money Laundering .

with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The Nicolet SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Nicolet SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Nicolet SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Nicolet is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (b)    The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the Nicolet SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements presented in the Nicolet SEC Reports (collectively, the “Nicolet Financial Statements”) are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of Nicolet and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Nicolet Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Nicolet Financial Statements. The Nicolet Financial Statements do not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities, absolute or contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would render the Nicolet Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein. (c)    Nicolet is in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any of its Subsidiaries.

A s of the Nicolet Capitalization Date, to the Knowledge of Nicolet, such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance. (d)    Nicolet and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Nicolet presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of Nicolet’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their evaluations as of the Nicolet Evaluation Date. Since the Nicolet Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in Nicolet’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Nicolet’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

(e)    Nicolet and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2019, with all applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Nicolet and its Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of the other party) as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Company, Nicolet or any Subsidiary of the Company or Nicolet, respectively, or any change occurs with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or Nicolet, respectively, for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement that, in each case, is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, the Company or Nicolet, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other of such event, and the Company or Nicolet, as applicable, shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and, as required by applicable Legal Requirements, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company’s shareholders and to Nicolet’s shareholders.

Section 7.5    Tax Free Reorganization. (a)    The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Code and that this Agreement constitute a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Nicolet shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, neither Nicolet nor any Affiliate of Nicolet knowingly shall take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. (b)    As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason why it would not be able to deliver to Nicolet’s counsel, as of the date of the legal opinion referred to in Sections 8.8 and 9.8, a certificate substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto (the “IRS Guidelines”), to enable counsel of Nicolet to deliver the legal opinion contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8, and the Company hereby agrees to deliver such certificate effective as of the date of such opinion to counsel of Nicolet. (c)    As of the date hereof Nicolet does not know of any reason (i) why it would not be able to deliver to its counsel, as of the date of the legal opinion referred to in Sections 8.8 and 9.8, a certificate substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, to enable counsel of Nicolet to deliver the legal opinion contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8; or (ii) why counsel of Nicolet would not be able to deliver the opinion required by Sections 8.8 and 9.8. Nicolet hereby agrees to deliver such certificate effective as of the date of such opinion to counsel of Nicolet. (d)    Following the Effective Time, Nicolet will continue at least one significant historic business line of the Company, or use at least a significant portion of the Company’s historic business assets in a business, in each case within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(d), except that Nicolet may transfer the Company’s historic business assets (i) to a corporation that is a member of Nicolet’s “qualified group,” within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), or (ii) to a partnership if (A) one or more members of Nicolet’s “qualified group” have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to the Company’s historic business or (B) members of Nicolet’s “qualified group” in the aggregate own an interest in the partnership representing a significant interest in the Company’s historic business, in each case within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(iii). Section 7.6    Employees; Employee Contracts; Employee Benefits. (a)    All individuals employed by the Company or the Bank immediately prior to the Closing (“Covered Employees”) shall automatically become employees of Nicolet as of the Closing. Following the Closing, Nicolet shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee benefits and compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of Nicolet under the Nicolet Benefit Plans, provided, however, that: (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen Nicolet Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Nicolet shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Nicolet Benefit Plans, a Covered Employee’s continued participation in the Company Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the Nicolet Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each Nicolet Benefit Plan). (b)    For all purposes (other than purposes of benefit accruals and, for plan year 2021 only, allocations of employer contributions under Nicolet’s 401(k) Plan) under the Nicolet Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the “New Plans”), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such

Covered Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. (c)    In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Transition Date, Nicolet shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the Transition Date collectively, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into account under such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred during the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. ( d )    Section 7.6 of the Nicolet Disclosure Schedules sets forth the severance payments that will be paid with respect to any eligible Covered Employee (exempt and non-exempt) who incurs a qualifying involuntary termination of employment in accordance with such schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Covered Employee eligible to receive severance benefits or other payment triggered by the Merger under an employment, change in control, severance, salary continuation agreement or other similar agreement (a “CIC Payment”) shall be entitled to receive the severance benefits described in this Section 7.6(d) or to otherwise receive severance benefits from Nicolet. Any Company employee who is eligible to receive a CIC Payment shall not receive any severance benefits as provided in this Section 7.6(d) but rather will be entitled to the CIC Payment payable under the terms of the applicable agreement.

Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of Company Capital Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock or acquisition of Nicolet Common Stock, as applicable, in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

For purposes of this Section 10.1(j), the following definitions apply: “Determination Date” means the fifteenth (15th) Business Day prior to the scheduled Closing Date, as extended from time to time. “Final Index Price” means the sum of the Final Prices of each company comprising the Index. “Final Price” with respect to any company included in the Index, means the volume weighted average closing price of a share of common stock of such company (and if there is no closing sales price on any such day, then the mean between the closing bid and the closing asked prices on that day), as reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system for the market or exchange on which such common stock is principally traded, for the twenty (20) trading day period immediately preceding the Determination Date. “Index” means the SNL U.S. Bank $5B-$10B Index or, if such index is not available, such substitute or similar index as substantially replicates the SNL U.S. Bank $5B-$10B Index. “Initial Index Price” means the sum of the Initial Prices of each company comprising the Index.

Section 10.3    Fees and Expenses. (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC, in each case in connection with the Merger (other than attorneys’ fees, accountants’ fees and related expenses), shall be shared equally by Nicolet and the Company. (b)    If this Agreement is terminated by Nicolet pursuant to Section 10.1(g) or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(h), then the Company shall pay to Nicolet, within two (2) Business Days after such termination, the amount of $10,000,000 (the “Termination Fee ”) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Nicolet shall designate.

The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 11.5 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. Section 11.4    Modification. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties at any time before or after the Company Shareholder Approval and/or Nicolet Shareholder Approval is obtained; provided, however, that after the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, there may not be, without further approval of the Company’s and Nicolet’s shareholders, respectively, any amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable Legal Requirements.

Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as provided in Article 10, the rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative.

EXHIBIT B 


FORM OF VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT 


Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. Attention: Chief Executive Officer 


Ladies and Gentlemen: 


    The undersigned is a shareholder of County Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), a Wisconsin corporation and a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. This Voting and Support Agreement relates to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 22, 2021 (the “Agreement”), between the Company and Nicolet Bankshares, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (“Nicolet”). Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will be merged into and with Nicolet (the “Merger”), and the shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Company Common Stock”) will be converted into and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Agreement. This Voting and Support Agreement represents an agreement between the undersigned and Nicolet regarding certain rights and obligations of the undersigned in connection with the Merger. 


In consideration of the execution and delivery by Nicolet of the Agreement and the mutual covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein and therein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned and Nicolet, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 


1 . Vote on the Merger.  The undersigned agrees to vote all shares of Company Common Stock that the undersigned owns beneficially or of record in favor of approving the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, unless Nicolet is then in breach or default in any material respect as regards any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty as to it contained in the Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall be deemed to require the undersigned to vote any shares of Company Common Stock over which the undersigned has or shares voting power solely in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of any person, if the undersigned determines, in good faith after consultation with legal counsel, that such a vote would cause a breach of fiduciary duty to such other person. 


2 . Restriction on Transfer.  The undersigned further agrees that the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of Nicolet, transfer any shares of Company Common Stock prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, each such term as set forth in the Agreement, except (a) by operation of law, (b) by will, (c) under the laws of descent and distribution, (d) with the prior written consent of Nicolet, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, for any sales, assignments, transfers or other dispositions necessitated by hardship, (e) with the prior written consent of Nicolet, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, for any transfers related to estate planning, provided that the transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Voting and Support Agreement, or (f) as Nicolet may otherwise agree in writing. 


3 . No Agreement as Director or Officer.  The undersigned makes no agreement or understanding in this Voting and Support Agreement in the undersigned’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and nothing in this Voting and Support Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the undersigned in the undersigned’s capacity as such a director or officer, including exercising rights under the Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed to be a breach of this Voting and Support Agreement, or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the undersigned from exercising the undersigned’s fiduciary duties as an officer or director to the Company or its shareholders. 


4. Miscellaneous. This Voting and Support Agreement is the complete agreement between Nicolet and the undersigned concerning the subject matter hereof. Any notice required to be sent to any party hereunder shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or electronic mail using the addresses set forth herein or such other address as shall be furnished in writing by the parties. This Voting and Support Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin. 


Exhibit B-1








________________


5. Termination. This Voting and Support Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest of (a) the mutual written agreement of the undersigned and Nicolet, (b) the Effective Time, (c) the termination of the Agreement in accordance with its terms, (d) any reduction in the Merger Consideration, extension of the Termination Date, change in the type of merger consideration, or other amendment, modification, waiver or change to the Agreement that is material and adverse to the undersigned and not consented to in advance in writing by the undersigned, and (e) December 31, 2024. For the avoidance of doubt, a decline in Nicolet’s stock price shall not be considered a reduction in the merger consideration. 


6. Capitalized Terms . Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms in this Voting and Support Agreement shall have the same meaning as given such terms in the Agreement.

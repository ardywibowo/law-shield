Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A. 


RECITALS 


A. Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the “Offer”) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the “Shares”) for $38.00 per Share (such amount or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the “Offer Price”), to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. B. Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and as an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided in Section 2.5, (i) each issued and outstanding Share not owned by Parent, Purchaser or the Company as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest and (ii) the Company shall become an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger. C. The board of directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) agreed that the Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) and other relevant provisions of the DGCL, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent and its wholly owned Subsidiaries) tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (such recommendation, the “Company Board Recommendation”). D. The board of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively, to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions. E. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledges and agrees that the Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be consummated immediately following the Offer Acceptance Time.

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, each of Baupost Group Securities, L.L.C. and Ronald C. Renaud, Jr. have entered into and delivered to Parent a tender and support agreement in connection with the Offer and the Merger.   1

AGREEMENT 


The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I THE OFFER 


Section 1.1 The Offer. (a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than ten business days following the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer. (b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the “Offer Conditions”). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the “Offer to Purchase”) that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions or any other terms or conditions of this Agreement in a manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any holder of Shares or that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the Offer or prevent, delay or impair the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, (F) change or waive the Minimum Condition, (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or permitted by this Agreement or (H) provide any “subsequent offering period” within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1.   2








________________


(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at one minute following 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 20th business day following the Offer Commencement Date, determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the “Initial Expiration Date”, and such date or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the “Expiration Date”). Subject to the Parties’ respective termination rights under Section 8.1: (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to ten business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to ten business days per extension, until the Regulatory Condition has been satisfied; and (iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, Purchaser shall, at the request of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; provided, that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (the “Extension Deadline”) (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1 and (y) the first business day immediately following the End Date; or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1. (d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. (e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the “Schedule TO”) that shall contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the “Offer Documents”) filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and to correct any material omissions therefrom, and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; it being understood that nothing in this Section 1.1(g) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 


Section 1.2 Company Actions. (a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the “Schedule 14D-9”) that, subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and a notice of appraisal rights as contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL.

obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. (b) Promptly (but in no event later than three business days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the “Certificates”) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book- Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to Section 2.5. (c) At any time following 12 months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them.   8








________________


Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any “stop, look and listen” communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.1 to the extent that any such communication expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation. The provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, which shall require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to three business days shall be deemed to be two business days, during which time the Company and its Representatives shall again comply with clause (3) above; and (ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change in Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least three business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the three business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal, and shall have made its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to do so) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of any such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals made in writing by Parent, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance, which shall require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to three business days shall be deemed to be two business days, during which time the Company and its Representatives shall again comply with clause (3) above.

Section 6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company who is employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one year period (each, a “Continuing Employee”) a base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and incentive compensation opportunities, each of which is no less favorable than the base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and broad-based employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-based awards, severance (which is covered by Section 6.4(a)) and change in control plans, programs, perquisites and arrangements) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits (excluding equity and equity-based awards, severance (which is covered by Section 6.4(a)) and change in control plans, programs, perquisites and arrangements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing: (a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee who suffers a termination of employment under circumstances that would have given the Continuing Employee a right to severance payments and benefits under any Employee Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with severance payments and benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee under such applicable Employee Plan. (b) Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for purposes of (i) eligibility to participate and eligibility for vesting (excluding Parent’s Post-65 Retiree Medical benefits that were eliminated for new hires as of January 1, 2020, and any Parent subsidies such as retiree medical benefits), and (ii), only under Parent’s and/or Surviving Corporation’s vacation, sick and/or PTO policies, levels of benefits, in each case under Parent’s and/or the Surviving Corporation’s employee benefit plans and arrangements to the extent such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate in such plans and arrangements and coverage under such plans and arrangements replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately prior to the Closing Date, with respect to his or her length of service with the Company (and its predecessors) prior to the Closing Date; provided, that the foregoing shall not result in the duplication of benefits under any such employee benefit plans and arrangements or under any defined benefit pension plan. (c) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication of benefits), assume, as of the Effective Time, the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company. (d) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances under any health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions,   48








________________


exclusions and waiting periods would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which such employees participated prior to the Effective Time and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances, credit Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time with the Company (and its predecessors) to the same extent that such service and amounts paid was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company. (e) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, if requested by Parent in writing at least ten business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the Translate Bio, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) to be terminated. If Parent provides such written notice to the Company, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date), and the Company shall have taken all steps necessary to terminate the 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require. To the extent that the 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to Parent’s request, Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall take commercially reasonable efforts to effect a direct rollover of any eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code), including any outstanding loans, to such 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to each such Continuing Employee. (f) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

(c) Parent’s right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and any payments pursuant to Section 8.3(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. (d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received.   57

Section 9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger, except for those covenants that by their terms survive the Effective Time, this Article IX and the any applicable defined terms in Exhibit A shall survive the Effective Time.

Section 9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any laws, rules or provisions that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Except if the Termination Fee has been paid pursuant to Section 8.3, each of the Parties hereto agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 3.7 Payment for Company Shares. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company (reasonably acceptable to the Company) (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to act as paying agent with respect to the Merger (the “Paying Agent”). The Company shall be responsible for all costs and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Closing, Parent and the Purchaser shall make available, or cause to be made available, to the Paying Agent an aggregate amount in cash sufficient to enable the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Shares become entitled under Section 3.6 and Section 3.9 (the “Exchange Fund”). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate consideration contemplated by Section 3.6 and Section 3.9, Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds to the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency required to make such payments. Until disbursed in accordance with this Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that any such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States government with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States government and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Earnings on the Exchange Fund in excess of the amounts payable to the Company Stockholders shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation as Parent directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this Article III. (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of a stock certificate representing Company Shares (each, a “Company Stock Certificate”) or a holder of record immediately prior to the Effective Time of such shares not represented by a stock certificate (each, a “Book Entry Share”) not held through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) (other than Excluded Shares, and subject to the last sentence of Section 3.8(a), Appraisal Shares) a form of letter of transmittal (mutually approved in form and substance by the Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share, as the case may be, in exchange for the Merger consideration (less any required withholding of Taxes) issuable and payable in respect thereof. Parent shall ensure that, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent in connection with the transfer of a Book Entry Share not held through DTC or surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, as applicable, in each case together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share (or, under the circumstances described in Section 3.7(f) (and subject to the terms thereof), the transferee of the Company Shares previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share) shall promptly receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash to which such holder (or transferee) is entitled pursuant to Section 3.6(a), subject to Section 3.7(g). No interest will be paid to holders of Book Entry Shares or Company Stock Certificates in connection with, or accrued on, the Merger consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.6(a). With respect to Book Entry Shares held through DTC, which Book Entry Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger consideration pursuant to Section 3.6(a), the holder of such Book Entry Shares shall not be required to








________________


deliver an executed letter of transmittal. 


27 


(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares, and subject to the last sentence of Section 3.8(a), Appraisal Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Amount (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Paying Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date. (d) On or after the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to deliver to the Surviving Corporation any funds made available by Parent and the Purchaser to the Paying Agent that have not been disbursed to holders of record of stock certificates formerly representing Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares, and subject to the last sentence of Section 3.8(a), Appraisal Shares) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or Book Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation with respect to the cash amounts payable upon surrender of such stock certificates or Book Entry Shares. Neither the Paying Agent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of any such stock certificate or Book Entry Share for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property or escheat law. (e) If any stock certificate representing Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares, and subject to the last sentence of Section 3.8(a), Appraisal Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the Person claiming that such stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate the cash amount (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to this Agreement) payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Paying Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such amount, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount. 


28 


(f) If any Merger consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.6(a) is requested to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the Book Entry Share transferred or Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange has submitted all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence that any applicable transfer or similar Taxes relating to such transfer have been paid, or to establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that any such Taxes are not applicable, and that the surrendered Company Stock Certificate of Book Entry Share, as applicable, shall be properly endorsed and presented to the Paying Agent or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and is accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer. (g) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable or deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect thereto under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Laws relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority as required by applicable Laws and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. After the date of this Agreement, the Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) (x) reasonably cooperate with Parent or Purchaser in connection with determining whether any withholding Taxes are applicable to payments made in connection with this Agreement, and determining the amount of any withholding Taxes applicable to payments made in connection with this Agreement (including any such Taxes imposed by taxing authorities in India or China) and (y) take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser to minimize to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any such Taxes that may be imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby as a result of the People’s Republic of China Administration of Taxation Circular 7 (2015) or any similar or associated Laws of the People’s Republic of China or any other jurisdiction. Section 3.8 Appraisal Rights. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Company Shares that constitute Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive payment in accordance with Section 3.6, shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares (a “Dissenting Stockholder”) shall be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Appraisal Shares as may be granted to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, no Dissenting Stockholder shall have, or be entitled to exercise, any of the voting rights or other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall otherwise withdraw or lose such holder’s right of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) any right of such Dissenting Stockholder to require the Surviving Corporation to purchase such Appraisal Shares for cash shall be extinguished, and (ii) such Appraisal Shares shall automatically be converted into, and shall represent only the right to receive (subject to compliance with Section 3.7), payment for such Appraisal Shares, without interest thereon, in accordance with Section 3.6. 


29 


(b) The Company (i) shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demand received by the Company from any stockholder of the Company for appraisal of such stockholder’s Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, (ii) shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, and (iii) shall give Parent the opportunity to review, and have the Company consider in good faith all reasonable comments to, any written document to be given to any third party of Governmental Authority in connection therewith. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands for appraisal, in each case, without the prior written consent of Parent. Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands for appraisal.

Effective as of the Acceptance Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and a holder of any Company Restricted Stock Unit, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is then outstanding at such time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested (to the extent that vesting is based on the achievement of performance goals for a performance period that has not been completed as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, performance shall be deemed achieved at the target level of performance, or if greater the level of performance required by the award agreement evidencing the applicable Company Restricted Stock Unit) and shall be cancelled, and in exchange therefore, the holder of each such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be entitled to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Amount, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment pursuant to Section 3.7. (b) Treatment of Company Restricted Shares. Effective as of the Acceptance Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and a holder of any Company Restricted Share, each Company Restricted Share that is then outstanding and unvested shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested (to the extent that vesting is based on the achievement of performance goals for a performance period that has not been completed as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, performance shall be deemed achieved at the target level of performance, or if greater the level of performance required by the award agreement evidencing the applicable Company Restricted Share), and all such vested Company Restricted Shares shall be treated identically to all other Company Shares with respect to the payment of the Per Share Amount (except as provided in Section 3.9(c) below).

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and subject to applicable Laws and Section 6.4, each of Parent and the Purchaser shall be entitled, through its officers, employees and Representatives (including its legal advisors and accountants), to have such access to the properties, businesses, operations, books and records, and all financial, operating, Tax and other data and information of the Company Entities with respect to the Business as Parent or the Purchaser, as applicable, reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written notice in connection with their respective efforts to consummate the Transactions. No such access shall be granted for, and Parent, Purchaser and their Representatives shall not conduct, any environmental sampling (including sampling of air, water, soil, sediment or building materials). Any such access and examination shall be conducted during regular business hours and under circumstances that do not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Business and shall be subject to restrictions under applicable Law and COVID-19 Measures and, notwithstanding the foregoing, may be limited to the extent the Company reasonably determines, in light of the COVID-19 Pandemic (taking into account any “shelter-in-place” or similar order issued by a Governmental Authority), that such access jeopardizes the health and safety of any employee or other personnel of any Company Entity. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent, the Purchaser and their respective Representatives in connection with such access and examination, and Parent, the Purchaser and their respective Representatives shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Representatives and shall use their reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the Company Entities. Any disclosure by the Company Entities during such investigation by Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective Representatives shall not constitute any enlargement or additional representation or warranty of the Company beyond those specifically set forth in Article IV. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no such access or examination shall be permitted to the extent that it (i) relates to the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions, (ii) would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company Entities, (iii) would require the Company to disclose information that is subject to attorney-client or other legal privilege or may conflict with any applicable Law or confidentiality obligations to which the Company Entities are bound; provided, that in any event, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any such information in a manner such that this clause (iii) shall not apply, or (iv) would jeopardize the health and safety of any employee or other personnel of the Company Entities in light of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 


65 


(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, without the written consent of the Company Entities (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall, and Parent and the Purchaser shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, contact (i) any customers or vendors of the Company Entities with respect to matters involving the Transactions, the Business or any Company Entity or (ii) any employees, independent contractors, or other personnel of any Company Entity. Section 6.6 Efforts to Consummate the Transactions. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to Section 6.6(f), each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including: (a) taking, or causing to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, authorizations, orders, exemptions or waivers by any Third Person in connection with the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the Offer and the Merger, and (b) not taking any action that would be reasonably likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the Transactions; provided that in respect of Contracts between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Third Person, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to make or agree to make any payment or accept any material conditions or obligations unless such payment, condition or obligation is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each party hereto shall furnish to outside antitrust counsel for the other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. 


66 


(b) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall (i) promptly notify the other of and, if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other of) any communications from or with any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or oral communication with any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, (iii) not participate in any meeting or have any communication with any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions unless it has given the other an opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, give the other the opportunity to attend and participate therein and (iv) furnish the other with copies of all filings and communications between it and any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights of the parties under this Section 6.6(b) may be exercised on their behalf by their respective outside counsel. (c) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with one another, and use reasonable best efforts to, prepare all documentation (including furnishing all information required under the Competition Laws to effect promptly all filings with any Governmental Authority and to obtain all consents, waivers and approvals of any Governmental Authority) necessary to consummate the Transactions. Each party hereto shall provide to outside antitrust counsel for the other copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions or any of the matters described in this Section 6.6. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly inform outside antitrust counsel for the other of any substantive oral communication with, and provide outside antitrust counsel for the other with copies of written communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate in any meeting or conference call with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving outside antitrust counsel for the other party prior notice of the meeting or conference call and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. To the extent permissible under applicable Law, the outside antitrust counsel for the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under the Competition Laws. The parties hereto








________________


may, as they deem advisable, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 6.6(c) or any other section of this Agreement as “outside legal counsel only.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside legal counsel to employees, officers, inside legal counsel, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that it is Parent’s ultimate right to devise the strategy and direct matters for obtaining approvals under Competition Laws, including any of Parent’s filings, submissions or communications with or to any Governmental Antitrust Authority in connection therewith, and taking into account in good faith any comments of the Company relating to such strategy. 


67 


(d) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.6, the parties hereto shall provide or cause to be provided (including by their “ultimate parent entities” as that term is defined in the HSR Act) as promptly as practicable to any Governmental Antitrust Authority information and/or documentary material requested by such Governmental Antitrust Authority or which is necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions, including filing any notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof. To the extent then permitted under applicable Law, the Purchaser shall (and shall cause its “ultimate parent entity” as that term is defined in the HSR Act to) request “early termination” in the filing made by it under the HSR Act. All filing fees required under the HSR Act and as may be required under any other applicable Competition Laws in connection with the Transactions shall be borne by Parent. (e) If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any applicable Law or if any Action is instituted by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any applicable Law, each of the parties hereto shall, each bearing its own costs, use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or defend against any action to prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the Transactions); and (ii) take such action as reasonably necessary to overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental Authority to prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the Transactions), including by defending any Action brought by any Governmental Authority in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, in order to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Authority or private party may have to such transactions under such applicable Law so as to permit consummation of the Transactions on or before the Outside Date. (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to obtain any authorization, consent or approval of a Governmental Authority (including in connection with any filings with any Governmental Authority) necessary or advisable so as to enable the consummation of the Transactions, to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no later than the Outside Date) and to resolve, avoid or eliminate any impediments or objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Competition Law; provided, that notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.6 or otherwise in this Agreement shall require Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to: (i) propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, lease, license, or other disposition of businesses, product lines, rights, assets, or other operations or interests of Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) terminate or restructure existing relationships, contractual or governance rights or obligations of Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates; (iii) terminate any venture or other arrangement; (iv) defend through litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Authority, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of such transactions; or 


68 


(v) otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parent’s, the Purchaser’s or any of their respective Affiliates’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s and its Subsidiaries’) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or control, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries). Section 6.7 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification. (a) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall: (i) honor and fulfill in all respects all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in favor of each present (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) and former officer and director of each Company Entity, and each individual who is then serving or has served at the request of the Company as a director or officer of another Person, in each case determined as of the Effective Time (each such individual, an “Indemnified Individual”), as provided in the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ respective Organizational Documents or the indemnification or other agreements of any Company Entity with such Indemnified Individual, in each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries’ respective Organizational Documents to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Individuals as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the Organizational Documents of the Company Entities as of the date of this Agreement, which shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Individuals without the consent of such affected Indemnified Individuals. (b) Without limiting the foregoing or any additional rights that any Person may have under any Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and solely to the same extent that such indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions are provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company Entities as of the date of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Individual against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Individual is or was an officer, director, manager, agent, employee, fiduciary or agent of each Company Entity, or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the other transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under








________________


applicable Law; provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to advance any such expenses to the extent that the Indemnified Individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Individual is not entitled to indemnification. 


69 


(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, and may cause its Subsidiaries to, purchase a “tail” or “run-off” insurance policy which will remain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, with reputable and financially sound carriers offering coverage and in amounts not less favorable than the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company Entities and containing terms materially similar to the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company Entities with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (the “D&O Policy”); provided, in satisfying its obligations, the Company will not be obligated to pay an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (the “Maximum Premium”). If the aggregate annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, then the Company may obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. The Surviving Corporation agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the D&O Policy in full force and effect and fulfill its obligations thereunder throughout such six (6)-year period following the Effective Time. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Individual who is entitled to rights to exculpation, indemnification, reimbursement and advancement of expenses and any limitations on liability under the applicable certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and/or in any agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing similar rights and limitations in favor of such Indemnified Individual, on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall be deemed to be amended to continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or any its applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

Section 6.8 Financing. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Documents (it being understood and agreed that, in the event that the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or would reasonably be expected to become unavailable as a result of the automatic expiration and termination thereof because the Outside Date is extended to a date later than October 15, 2021, the Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain Alternative Financing pursuant to Section 6.8(e) below). (b) The Purchaser will not consent to any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, assignment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision (including any condition) or remedy under, any Financing Document (or any commitment in respect thereof) without the prior written consent of the Company, solely to the extent such amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, assignment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees, in each case if such changes would reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing), below the amount required to consummate the Transactions, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or any contingencies, or otherwise modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing in the amounts contemplated thereunder materially less likely to occur, or (iii) individually or in the aggregate with all other amendments, restatements, replacements, supplements, terminations, assignments, modifications or waivers, reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the Merger or the other Transaction, (B) make the funding of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing) less likely to occur at or prior to the Effective Time, (C) materially and adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Documents or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, or (D) materially and adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the Transactions; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser may otherwise amend, modify or replace, or agree to any waivers in respect of, any Commitment Letter pursuant to, and subject to, Section 6.8(e). In the event of such amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, assignment, modification or waiver of any Financing Document as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence, the financing under such amended, modified, restated, replaced, supplemented, assigned or waived Financing Document will be deemed to be “Debt Financing” as such term is used in this Agreement. 


71 


(c) The Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect each Financing Document (including any definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Debt Financing Documents) until the earlier of (x) the date that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof and (y) with respect to the Debt Financing, the date that the Debt Financing is funded in full, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (but in any event prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing) all terms, covenants and conditions in the Financing Documents applicable to the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates and Representatives (and that are within their control) to obtaining the Financing, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Documents or on other terms permitted under Section 6.8(b) and that are not materially less beneficial to the Purchaser than those included in the Debt Financing Documents as in effect on the date hereof (including with respect to the conditionality thereof), and (iv) consummate the Financing if all conditions to the consummation of the Offer set forth in Annex I have been satisfied or waived; provided, that in no event shall Parent or the Purchaser be obligated to bring any legal proceedings against any Financing Sources.








________________


(d) The Purchaser will keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of the Purchaser’s efforts to obtain the Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including advising and updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status, proposed Closing Date and material terms of the material definitive documentation for the Debt Financing. The Purchaser will promptly provide to the Company copies of all documents related to the Financing including any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, assignment, modification or waiver thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall give the Company prompt written notice of any breach, default, repudiation, cancellation, amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, assignment, modification or waiver (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to the same) by any party to any Financing Document of which the Purchaser becomes aware or any termination of any Financing Document. (e) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or would reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and conditions and from the sources contemplated by the applicable Financing Documents, including as a result of the automatic expiration and termination thereof because the Outside Date is extended to a date later than October 15, 2021, (i) the Purchaser will promptly notify the Company and (ii) the Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions (it being understood that the terms of Section 6.8(b) will apply to such alternative financing, and, subject to Section 6.8(i), the Purchaser shall have no obligation (except in the case of the automatic expiration and termination of any Financing Document because the Outside Date is extended to a date later than October 15, 2021) to accept any terms or conditions that are materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Purchaser than the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Financing Documents immediately prior to giving effect to the terms of such alternative financing) (“Alternative Financing”) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. In such event, as applicable: (1) the term “Debt Financing” as used in this Agreement will be deemed to include any such Alternative Financing, (2) the term “Debt Commitment Letter” will be deemed to include any commitment letters with respect to any such Alternative Financing and (3) the term “Financing Documents” will be deemed to include any definitive agreements with respect to the Alternative Financing. 


72 


(f) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing and the date that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with and reasonably assist Purchaser, at the Purchaser’s sole cost and expense, in connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing and causing the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Financing Documents to be satisfied, including using reasonable best efforts in (i) assisting with the preparation of syndication documents and materials, including bank information memoranda and private placement memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda, lender and investor presentations, rating agency materials and presentations, and other customary marketing materials in connection with the Debt Financing (all such documents and materials, collectively, the “Syndication Documents”), (ii) preparing and furnishing to the Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably practicable with the GAAP Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements, (iii) assisting in the preparation of schedules to collateral agreements, (iv) subject to any contractual agreement in effect, facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Debt Financing, including, upon reasonable advance written notice at mutually agreeable times and, if applicable, locations, taking actions necessary to permit the Debt Financing Sources to evaluate the Company Entities’ real property and personal property that would constitute collateral under the Debt Financing Documents, solely for the purpose of establishing pledges over such assets to secure the obligations under the Debt Financing Documents, in each case which shall not be required to be delivered or effective until at or promptly following the Effective Time, (v) subject to any contractual agreement in effect, obtaining customary payoff letters, lien releases, and instruments of termination or discharge, as applicable, in each case which shall provide that, if sufficient funds are received by the financing sources thereof in order to pay off in full all obligations (other than contingent indemnification and expense reimbursement obligations for which no claim has been made) in connection therewith or secured thereby, such release, termination and/or discharge shall be effective, (vi) furnishing the Purchaser and its Debt Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably practical (and at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) with all documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, that has been reasonably requested by the Purchaser at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and (vii) providing information necessary to prepare (and execute, on or subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date and to the extent applicable) reasonable and customary officers’ certificates, secretary certificates, perfection certificates, and other documentation required by the Debt Financing Sources and the definitive documentation related to the Debt Financing, and executing and delivering a solvency certificate in the form attached to each Debt Commitment Letter, in each case contingent upon, and the effectiveness thereof to be after, the occurrence of the Closing. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and each of its Subsidiaries’ logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, and is not reasonably expected to, harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or its Subsidiaries and their respective marks, products, services, offerings or Intellectual Property rights. 


73 


(g) Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 6.8(f), (i) the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for provision of any pro forma financial information, including cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro forma adjustments (provided, that, solely to the extent such financial information is available without unreasonable effort and expense and does not include separate financial statements for any of the Company’s Affiliates, the Company shall provide the Purchaser with financial and other information relating to the Business reasonably requested by the Purchaser to allow the Purchaser to prepare such pro forma financial information) and any financial projections of the Company Entities, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives shall be required to enter into or approve (or commit to enter into or approve) any certificate, document, agreement, instrument or Financing Document, in each case which will be effective prior to the Effective Time, (iii) nothing herein shall require cooperation contemplated thereby to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any of its Affiliates or their respective Affiliates, (iv) none of the Company or any of its Affiliates will be required to pay or commit to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability (including any guarantee, indemnity or pledge) in connection with the Debt Financing or the Syndication Documents prior to the Effective Time, (v) no Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be required to take any action to the extent such Representative will incur any personal liability (as opposed to liability in his or her capacity as an officer of such Person) by taking such actions in connection with the Debt Financing, and no Representative or Affiliate of the Company shall be required to adopt or execute any agreement, document, Financing Document or other instrument, in each case in connection with the Debt Financing, or adopt any resolutions or consents approving or authorizing the same or any actions in connection therewith, in each case to the extent

the same would be effective prior to the Effective Time, (vi) nothing herein will involve any binding commitment by the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives which commitment is not conditioned on the Effective Time and does not terminate without liability to the Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives upon the termination of this Agreement, and (vii) nothing herein will require the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives to provide any information or take any action, the disclosure or taking of which would violate applicable Law, any fiduciary duty, any Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a Third Person, or jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege held by the Company; provided, that, if the Company does not provide or cause its Representatives to provide such access or such information in reliance on the foregoing, then the Company shall (1) provide a written notice to the Purchaser stating that it is withholding such access or such information and (2) reasonably cooperate to provide the applicable access or information in a way that would not violate such applicable Law, fiduciary duty or Contract or otherwise jeopardize such privilege. (h) The Purchaser shall, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by the Company or any of its Representatives or Affiliates after the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing, including in connection with the cooperation of the Company and any of its Representatives and Affiliates contemplated by Section 6.8(f), on the earlier of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by any of them after the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.8) and costs and expenses incurred in defending against the foregoing, except to the extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arise from the willful and material breach of this Agreement by the Company, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or from Fraud on the part of the Company. The reimbursement and indemnification obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.8(h) shall be referred to collectively as the “Reimbursement and Indemnification Obligations.” 


74 


(i) All non-public or other confidential information regarding the Company or its Affiliates obtained by the Purchaser, its Affiliates, their Financing Sources or their respective Representatives, in each case pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such information may be shared (i) on a non-public basis with prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Debt Financing and participants in the Debt Financing, in each case that enter into confidentiality arrangements customary for financing transactions of the same type as the Debt Financing, and (ii) on a confidential basis with rating agencies. Section 6.9 No Solicitation. (a) Except as permitted by this Section 6.9, the Company shall not, and shall cause the other Company Entities and its and their respective officers and directors not to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or facilitate the making of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would be reasonably expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish or disclose any information regarding any of the Company Entities to any Third Person in connection with, or in a manner that would be reasonably expected to lead to, or for the purpose of initiating, soliciting or facilitating, in each case, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers that would be reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) enter into, participate or engage in or continue to participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Third Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would be reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) approve, adopt, endorse, recommend or execute or enter into, or commit to enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, expense reimbursement agreement, term sheet or similar agreement, with respect to or in connection with or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; 


75 


(v) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws or any anti-takeover provision in the Company’s Organizational Documents inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal; or (vi) resolve to do or publicly announce any of the foregoing; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may engage in any such discussions or negotiations and provide any such information in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn if (A) such bona fide written Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.9, (B) prior to providing any material non-public information regarding the Company to any Third Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such Third Person (or there is then in effect with such party) an executed confidentiality agreement that contains nondisclosure provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, (C) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (D) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law. Prior to or within twenty four (24) hours after providing any material non-public information to such Third Person, the Company shall make such material non-public information available to Parent and the Purchaser (to the extent such material non-public information has not been previously made available to Parent or the Purchaser or any of their respective Representatives). For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a violation of this Section 6.9 if the Company or its Representatives contact a Third Person making any Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and to determine whether it constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

(b) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers, or request for any discussions or negotiations, or any requests for information regarding the Company Entities concerning or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty four (24) hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal) notify the Purchaser in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry, offer, proposal or request (which notification shall include the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry, offer, proposal or request, and the terms and conditions thereof, including any financing arrangements to the extent provided to the Company or its Representatives), together with an underacted copy of, any such Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry, offer, proposal or request made in writing (or, a reasonably detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry, offer, proposal or request if made orally) and shall thereafter keep the Purchaser reasonably informed as to the status of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer.

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as permitted by Section 6.9(e), and shall not publicly propose to: (i) withdraw, withhold, modify, amend or qualify, or publicly propose or announce its intention to withdraw, withhold, modify, amend or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9; (ii) adopt, authorize, approve or recommend, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to approve or recommend to the Company Stockholders, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) if (A) the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal that remains outstanding (and is not a tender offer or exchange offer addressed by clause (iv) of this sentence), and (B) such Acquisition Proposal has not been rejected by the Company, fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within two (2) Business Days after receipt of a written request from Parent to do so (which request may only be made once with respect to such Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently modified in any material respect or the Company subsequently makes a disclosure with respect to such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.9(c), in which case Parent may make such request once each time such modification or disclosure is made), (iv) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer by a Third Person pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer; provided, that taking no position or a neutral position with respect to the acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders shall constitute a failure to recommend against the acceptance of such tender or exchange offer (any action described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) being referred to as a “Change in Recommendation”) or (v) allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement to effect any Acquisition Proposal, including a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with this Section 6.9); provided that none of (1) the determination in itself by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal or (2) the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 6.9(e) will constitute a Change in Recommendation or violate this Section 6.9. 


77 


(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may: (i) effect a Change in Recommendation in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning an Acquisition Proposal if: (1) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.9; (2) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, (A) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) that in light of such Acquisition Proposal, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation and/or to cause the Company to enter into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws; (3) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least five (5) Business Days in advance of the Company Board’s determination to effect a Change in Recommendation and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this Section 6.9(e)(i), which notice shall state that the Company Board intends to take such action and shall include the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (including the consideration offered therein, the identity of the








________________

78 


(4) during such five (5) Business Day notice period described above (or in the case of a Proposal Amendment Notice, during such period beginning on the day of delivery of such Proposal Amendment Notice and ending on the later to occur of the third (3rd) Business Day following the day of such delivery and the end of the original five (5) Business Day period described above) (the “Decision Period”), prior to its effecting a Change in Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent; and (5) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any such revisions to this Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the last day of the Decision Period in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have determined (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation in connection therewith would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws. (ii) effect a Change in Recommendation not related to an Acquisition Proposal if: (1) any Change in Circumstances arises or occurs which is continuing; (2) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws; 


79 


(3) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least five (5) Business Days in advance, of its determination to effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this Section 6.9(e)(ii), which notice shall expressly state that a Change in Circumstance has occurred and is continuing, and include a summary and reasonable description of the Change in Circumstances; (4) during such notice period, prior to its effecting a Change in Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent; and (5) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any such revisions that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the last day of such five (5) Business Day notice period described above in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have made the determination (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company Board may not effect a Change in Recommendation under Section 8.1(e) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) until the expiration of the applicable notice period set forth in clauses (e)(i) or (e)(ii) above, and unless and until the Company Board concludes in good faith, after considering any proposed offer to modify the terms of the Agreement from Parent (if any) that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws. The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.9 by any of its Representatives acting on behalf and at the direction of the Company shall be deemed to constitute a breach by the Company of this Section 6.9.

(d) In the event this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (at a time when the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i)) or by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h) or Section 8.1(i), then Parent shall, within two (2) Business Days following such termination of this Agreement (but subject to the receipt of valid wiring instructions pursuant to Section 8.3(h)) pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its designee an amount equal to $11,824,000 (the

“Parent Termination Fee”). (e) In no event shall any party hereto or any Person on any party’s behalf be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable at different times or upon the occurrence of different events. The Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required to be paid will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger; provided that payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, shall not constitute liquidated damages in the case of Fraud or a willful and material breach of this Agreement. (f) Subject in all respects to Section 9.12 and Section 8.3(h), in circumstances where the Company Termination Fee and/or Expense Amount is payable in accordance with Section 8.3(a), (b) or (c), Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee and/or Expense Amount from or on behalf of the Company plus the Enforcement Expenses, if any, shall be Parent’s and the Purchaser’s sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise) against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, general or limited partners, controlling Persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, general or limited partner, controlling Person, stockholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) and any Person who pays the Company Termination Fee on the Company’s behalf for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties and any Person who pays the Company Termination Fee on the Company’s behalf for all breaches, losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, and upon payment of such amount, plus the Enforcement Expenses, if any, none of the Company Related Parties or any Person who pays the Company Termination Fee on the Company’s behalf shall have any further liability or obligation relating to, or arising out of, this Agreement or the Transactions. While Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief under Section 9.12 and the payment of monetary damages under Section 8.2, or the Company Termination Fee and/or Expense Amount under Section 8.3(a), (b), or (c), respectively, under no circumstances shall Parent (or its designee) be entitled to receive both (i) a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief that results in the Closing occurring and (ii) monetary damages or the payment of the Company Termination Fee and/or Expense Amount in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason at a time when Parent would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, Parent or its designee shall be entitled to receipt of any Company Termination Fee and/or Expense Amount that would have been (or would have subsequently become) payable had Parent terminated this Agreement at such time and (ii) in the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Purchaser for any reason at a time when the Company would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, the Company or its designee shall be entitled to receipt of any Parent Termination Fee that would have been (or would have subsequently become) payable had the Company terminated this Agreement at such time. For clarity, nothing in this Section 8.3(f) will affect the rights and obligations of any party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement. 


88 


(g) Subject in all respects to Section 9.12 and Section 8.3(h), in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.3(d), the Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee from or on behalf of Parent, plus the Reimbursement and Indemnification Obligations and the Enforcement Expenses, if any, (including, without duplication, the Company’s right to enforce the Limited Guaranties with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee, Reimbursement and Indemnification Obligations and the Enforcement Expenses, if any, from the Guarantors) shall be the Company and its Subsidiaries’ sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise) against Parent, the Purchaser, the Guarantors, the Debt Financing Sources or any of their respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, general or limited partners, controlling Persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, general or limited partner, controlling Person, stockholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Parent Related Parties” and, together with the Company Related Parties, the “Related Parties”) and any Person who pays the Parent Termination Fee on Parent’s behalf for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, and upon payment of such amount, plus the Reimbursement and Indemnification Obligation and the Enforcement Expenses, if any, (including, without duplication, the Company’s right to enforce the Limited Guaranties with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee, Reimbursement and Indemnification Obligations and the Enforcement Expenses, if any, from the Guarantors), none of the Parent Related Parties or any Person who pays the Parent Termination Fee on Parent’s behalf shall have any further liability or obligation relating to, or arising out of, this Agreement or the Transactions. While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief under Section 9.12 and, following termination of this Agreement, the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section 8.3(d) or the Reimbursement and Indemnification Obligation, respectively, under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to receive both (i) a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief that results in the Equity Financing being funded or the Closing occurring and (ii) monetary damages for the (a) the Parent Termination Fee to the extent it is payable in accordance with Section 8.3(d), (b) the Reimbursement and Indemnification Obligation and (c) the Enforcement Expenses in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement. For clarity, nothing in this Section 8.3(g) will affect the rights and obligations of any party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement.

(h) Payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent or the Company, respectively, to the other party in writing. The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. In the event that the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee when due, the Company shall (i) reimburse Parent for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable

and documented fees and expenses of counsel) actually incurred or accrued by Parent in connection with the collection and enforcement of this Section 8.3 and (ii) pay Parent interest on the amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 calculated as commencing when such amount was payable pursuant to this Agreement and continuing until the date such amount is actually paid, at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal or similar national publication and compounded quarterly. In the event that Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, Parent shall (x) reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) actually incurred or accrued by the Company in connection with the collection and enforcement of this Section 8.3 and (y) pay the Company interest on the amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.3 calculated as commencing when such amount was payable pursuant to this Agreement and continuing until the date such amount is actually paid, at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal or similar national publication and compounded quarterly. The fees, costs and expenses payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(h) shall be referred to collectively as the “Enforcement Expenses.”

Section 9.6 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be considered in interpreting or construing any of the provisions contained in this Agreement. Section 9.7 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including investment advisory and legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions; provided, however, that Parent and the Purchaser shall be responsible for (i) all Transfer Taxes (as well as the filing of all Tax Returns with respect thereto) and (ii) all filing fees and expenses pursuant to the HSR Act and other Competition Laws. Section 9.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Annexes and Exhibits) and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to in this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Limited Guaranties and the Commitment Letters, together with the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter; provided, however, this Agreement shall not supersede the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in accordance with its terms and this Agreement. Section 9.9 Waiver and Amendment. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a mutual written agreement executed and delivered by the Company and Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that no such amendment, modification or supplement shall result in the Merger consideration not being the same amount and kind of cash, property, rights or securities as the consideration being offered to holders of Company Shares in the Offer; provided, further, that, after the Acceptance Time, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall adversely affect the rights of the Company Stockholders (other than Parent or its Affiliates) hereunder without the approval of such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendments, modifications or waivers with respect to the provisions of which any Financing Source is expressly made a third-party beneficiary pursuant to Section 9.11 (or related defined terms) shall be permitted in a manner adverse to any Financing Source without the prior written consent of the Financing Source. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, any failure of any party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Section 9.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, including by means of facsimile or email in Portable Document Format, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 9.11 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except (i) for the rights of the holders of Company Shares, from and after the Acceptance Time, to receive the Offer Price or, from and after the Effective Time, to receive the Per Share Amount, as applicable, and, from and after the Acceptance Time, the holders of Company Restricted Stock Units to receive the applicable consideration described in Section 3.9, in each case, from and after the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, as applicable, and in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) as provided in Section 6.7 (which is intended for the benefit of the Indemnified Individuals), Section 8.3(f) (which is intended for the benefit of the Company Related Parties), Section 8.3(g) (which is intended for the benefit of the Parent Related Parties) and Section 9.2, Section 9.3(c), Section 9.9 and Section 9.13 (each of which is intended for the benefit of the Financing Sources), this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and no third parties shall be beneficiaries hereto. Section 9.12 Remedies. (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity and shall waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the party seeking the injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief has an adequate remedy of Law. The remedies available to the parties pursuant to this Section 9.12 shall be in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the parties from seeking to obtain such other remedies; provided, that in no event shall the Company be entitled to both the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee and specific performance or other equitable remedy. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that until this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief enforcing Parent’s and Purchaser’s obligations to cause (x) the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger or (y) fund the Per Share Amount payable in the Offer and Parent’s and Purchaser’s obligations to cause the Acceptance Time to occur and to effect the consummation of the Offer and the Closing (but not the right of the Company to obtain such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the following conditions being satisfied: (A)(1) with respect to the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the consummation of the Offer, but each of which conditions shall be capable of being satisfied upon the consummation of the Offer) have been satisfied by the date the consummation of the Offer is required to have occurred, or (2) with respect to the Merger, all of the conditions in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but each of which conditions shall be capable of being satisfied upon the Closing) have been satisfied by the date the Closing is required to have occurred, (B) Parent and Purchaser are required to, but fail to, complete the Offer or consummate the Merger by the date the Offer is required to have occurred or the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to this Agreement, (C) the Debt Financing Sources have confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded, and (D) the Company has confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing are funded, then it would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur; provided, however, that if the Company receives a grant of specific performance pursuant to this Section 9.12 and the Closing occurs, then the Company will be deemed to have waived any and all rights to pursue and recover all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(d) and any other remedy as a matter of applicable Law, Contract, tort, equity or otherwise (for money damages or otherwise) upon such receipt of specific performance, other than any expenses and costs incurred in enforcing its rights under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent’s or Purchaser’s obligation to consummate the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing were to be funded at the Closing). 


95 


Section 9.13 Non-Recourse. All Actions (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any Action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) may, except to the extent set forth in the Commitment Letters or the Limited Guaranties, be made only against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and thereto. Section 9.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof. Rather, the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be modified so that it is valid, legal, and enforceable and to the fullest extent possible, reflects the intention of the parties.

(4) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material respects its obligations, agreements and covenants required to be complied with or performed by it prior to the Expiration Time under the Agreement; (5) since the date of the Agreement, no Company Material Adverse Effect shall have arisen or occurred and be continuing; (6) Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a duly authorized executive officer of the Company, dated the Expiration Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in Clauses (3),(4) and (5) of this Annex I have been satisfied; (7) this Agreement shall have not been validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 of this Agreement; and (8) there shall be validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer that number of Company Shares that, when added to the Company Shares then owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, constitute at least a majority of the total number of then issued and outstanding Company Shares (excluding shares of Company Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been “received” as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer pursuant to such procedures) (the condition in this clause (8) being referred to as the “Minimum Condition”); provided, that with respect to any Company Shares that are deemed beneficially owned as a result of Parent’s, the Purchaser’s or any of their respective Subsidiaries’ ownership of the Convertible Notes, such Company Shares shall only be counted toward the Minimum Condition if such Convertible Notes have been validly and effectively converted into Company Shares. The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and the Purchaser and may be waived (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law) by Parent or the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Condition, which may not be waived), in each case, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and other applicable Law.

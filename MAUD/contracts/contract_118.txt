The Form of Election may be used by each eligible Minority Limited Partner to designate such Minority Limited Partner’s Retention Election(s). Any such Minority Limited Partner’s Retention Election shall be deemed to have been properly made only if Parent shall have received at its principal executive office, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days before the scheduled date of the Company Shareholders’ Meeting (the “Election Date”), a Form of Election specifying that such Minority Limited Partner exercises the Retention Election with respect to the Class A Partnership Units specified by such Minority Limited Partner in the Minority Limited Partner’s Form of Election and otherwise properly completed and signed. The Form of Election shall state therein the date that constitutes the Election Date.   (ii)           A Form of Election may be revoked by any Minority Limited Partner only by written notice received by Parent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date. In addition, all Forms of Election shall be automatically revoked if the Partnership Merger has been abandoned.   (iii)          The reasonable determination of Parent shall be binding as to whether or not any Retention Election has been properly made or revoked. If Parent determines that any Retention Election was not properly made, Parent shall notify the applicable Minority Limited Partner of

the improper Retention Election and provide a reasonable opportunity to such Minority Limited Partner to cure the improper Retention Election. If, following such reasonable period, the improperly made Retention Election remains uncured, the Class A Partnership Units with respect to which such Retention Election was not properly made shall be automatically converted into Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(a). Parent may, with the agreement of the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 2.2(b) for the implementation of Retention Elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or desirable to fully effect such Retention Elections.   (iv)          Each eligible Minority Limited Partner, as a condition to making a Retention Election with respect to such Minority Limited Partner’s Class A Partnership Units subject to such Retention Election, shall, in the Form of Election, agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Amended Partnership Agreement.

  (v)           The Company and the Company Subsidiaries agree to reasonably cooperate with Parent in preparing any disclosure statement or other disclosure information to accompany the Form of Election, including information applicable to an offering of securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 506 thereunder, each of which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company.   (vi)          Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Partnership shall deliver to each Roll-Over Limited Partner that retained Class A Partnership Units, pursuant to the terms of Section 2.2(a) and (b), a notice confirming such Roll-Over Limited Partner’s record ownership of the Retained Class A Partnership Units.

(c)            Partnership Units Held by the Company and Roll-Over Limited Partners. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any partnership interest in the Partnership, (i) each Partnership Unit held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing Units”) shall be unaffected by the Partnership Merger and shall remain outstanding as a Partnership Unit of the Surviving Partnership held by the Company or relevant wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) the Roll-Over Limited Partners shall own the number of Retained Class A Partnership Units retained by them in the Partnership Merger.   (d)            Cancellation of Parent and Merger Sub II-Owned Partnership Units. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any partnership interest in the Partnership, each Partnership Unit held by Parent, Merger Sub II or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (collectively, the “Cancelled Units” and, together with the Continuing Units, the “Excluded Units”) shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, with no consideration to be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.   (e)            Cancellation of Merger Sub II Interests. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each partnership interest in Merger Sub II shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, the holders thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  Section 2.3            Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.   (a)            Company Options.  Effective immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Shares (each, a “Company Option”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of Company Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of the Per Company Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price applicable to the Company Option (less any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes). In the event that the exercise price of a Company Option exceeds the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled for no consideration.   (b)            Company Restricted Share Awards. Effective immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each award of restricted Company Shares (each, a “Company Restricted Share Award”) granted under a Company Share Incentive Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled, with the holder of each such Company Restricted Share Award becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of Company Shares subject to the Company Restricted Share Award immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Company Share Merger Consideration (less any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes).   (c)            Company Performance Units. Effective immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each outstanding award of performance units (“Company Performance Units”) shall automatically become earned and vested with respect to that number of Company Shares subject to such Company Performance Units determined (except as set forth in Section 2.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) in accordance with the terms of the Company Performance Units based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals set forth in the award agreement governing such Company Performance Units, as measured from the beginning of the applicable performance period through the date immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that for each award of Company Performance Units that vests based upon the attainment of operating funds from operations goals (except as set forth in Section 2.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter), such award of Company Performance Units shall be deemed earned at target level of performance in accordance with the terms of the award agreement governing such award (each such earned and vested Company Performance Unit, an “Earned Unit”). Each outstanding Company Performance Unit for which the level of performance has previously been determined and certified prior to the date of this Agreement and that remains subject to service-based vesting conditions shall, effective immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, automatically vest and shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as an Earned Unit. For the avoidance of doubt, Company Performance Units subject to this Section 2.3(c) shall include accrued dividend equivalents awarded with respect to Company Performance Units that were deemed reinvested in additional Company Shares in accordance with the applicable award agreement governing such Company Performance Units. At the Company Merger Effective Time, each Earned Unit shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to pay to each former holder of any such canceled Earned Unit an amount in cash (without interest, and less any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes) equal to the Per Company Share Merger Consideration for each Earned Unit. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Performance Unit that does not become an Earned Unit in accordance with this Section 2.3(c) shall terminate without consideration immediately prior to the

  (d)            Deferred Share Units. All equity-based awards deferred under, and all accounts that represent amounts notionally invested in Company Shares under, the Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Share Units”), and any accrued dividend equivalents in participant accounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan, shall, as of immediately before the Company Merger Effective Time, become vested and no longer subject to restrictions (including any holding period restrictions). All Deferred Share Units shall, at the Company Merger Effective Time, be adjusted and converted into a right of the holder to have allocated to the holder’s account under the Deferred Compensation Plan an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares deemed invested under or otherwise referenced by such account immediately before the Company Merger Effective Time and (ii) the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, and shall cease to represent a right to receive a number of Company Shares or cash equal to or based on the value of a number of Company Shares. The Deferred Compensation Plan shall otherwise be administered in accordance with its terms, subject to Section 5.9(d), and the payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan shall be made in accordance with the timing set forth in Section 5.1 of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the applicable payment elections for participants in such plan.   (e)            Company LTIP Units. With respect to each Company LTIP Unit that has vested in accordance with the terms of the relevant Award Agreement (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (each, a “Vested LTIP Unit”), prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company, as the general partner of the Partnership, shall exercise its right to cause a Class O LTIP Unit Mandatory Conversion (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) with respect to each Vested LTIP Unit, such that as of immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, each Vested LTIP Unit shall be converted into a number of Class A Partnership Units in accordance with Sections 4.9.C and 4.9F of the Partnership Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, that such conversion shall be determined taking into account any allocations that would be deemed to occur pursuant to Sections 4.9.F and 6.1.F of the Partnership Agreement if a Class A Unit Transaction (as defined therein) were considered to occur immediately prior to and in conjunction with such conversion, with the result that the Class O Unit Economic Capital Account Balance (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) of a holder of Vested LTIP Units is adjusted to give effect to any allocations that would occur in connection therewith.  For the avoidance of doubt, such Class A Partnership Units issued in respect of such Vested LTIP Units shall be treated as Class A Partnership Units for purposes of this Agreement and the holders of such Class A Partnership Units shall be treated as holders of Class A Partnership Units as described in Section 2.2.   


 12     


  (f)            Company ESPP. The Company shall take all actions as soon as practicable following the date hereof (or the Company shall have taken all actions prior to the date hereof, as applicable) with respect to the Company ESPP to provide that (i) with respect to any offering period in effect as of the date hereof (the “Current ESPP Offering Period”), such Current ESPP Offering Period shall be cancelled effective as of the date hereof, and on or promptly following the date hereof, all amounts credited to the accounts of participants will be refunded to participants in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP; (ii) following such cancellation of the Current ESPP Offering Period, the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement; and (iii) subject to the consummation of the Company Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.   (g)            Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required notices (which notices shall have been approved by Parent, in its reasonable discretion) to each holder of Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards, Company Performance Units, Deferred Share Units or Company LTIP Units setting forth each holder’s rights pursuant to the Company Share Incentive Plan and, as applicable, the Partnership Agreement, and stating that such Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards, Company Performance Units, Deferred Share Units and Company LTIP Units shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 2.2 or this Section 2.3, as applicable.   (h)            Cash amounts payable to (i) employees pursuant to Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c) shall be paid through the Company’s payroll, less any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes, and (ii) non-employee directors pursuant to Section 2.3(d) shall be paid by check, less any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes, in each case within ten (10) Business Days following the Company Merger Effective Time (or, (x) in the case of Section 2.3(c), at such time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code and (y) in the case of Section 2.3(d), at such time as applicable pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the applicable payment elections for participants in such plan).   (i)             Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary for the treatment of the Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards, Company Performance Units, Deferred Share Units and Company LTIP Units contemplated by this Section 2.3 and to ensure that, following the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards, Company Performance Units, Deferred Share Units or Company LTIP Units shall exist (and no holder of any rights in respect thereof shall have any further rights other than as expressly contemplated by this Section 2.3).

At or prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Company Shares, the Company Series A Preferred Shares, the Company Series B Preferred Shares and the Class A Partnership Units not subject to a valid and unrevoked Retention Election, the Merger Consideration, less the Per Company Share Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards and Earned Units, which amounts in respect of Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards and Earned Units shall be paid or delivered directly to the Surviving Company (the Merger Consideration so deposited being referred to herein as the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for in this Agreement. Any and all interest earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving Company.

    Section 2.5             Exchange Procedures.   (a)            Procedure. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), the Surviving Company shall (i) cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, represented outstanding Company Shares, Company Series A Preferred Shares or the Company Series B Preferred Shares or that, immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, represented Partnership Units, which (other than Company LTIP Units) were converted into the right to receive or be exchanged for the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series B Preferred Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2: (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.5(f) to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree and specify) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series B Preferred Share Merger Consideration or Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, to which the holder thereof is entitled, and (ii) pay (or deliver, as applicable) the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration to be paid or issued to holders of Class A Partnership Units that are not Retained Class A Partnership Units, less any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.5(f) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series B Preferred Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect of the Company Shares, Company Series A Preferred Shares, Company Series B Preferred Shares or Partnership Units, as applicable, previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares, Company Series A Preferred Shares, Company Series B Preferred Shares or Partnership Units to a Person that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company or Partnership, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units shall be required to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal or surrender such Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units to the Paying Agent. In lieu thereof, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units shall automatically upon the Company Merger Effective Time or the Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series B Preferred Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect of the Company Shares, Company Series A Preferred Shares, Company Series B Preferred Shares or Partnership Units, as applicable, previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Unit, in each case, as contemplated by this Section 2.5, each Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Closing Date to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series B Preferred Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrue for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Book-Entry Units on any cash payable hereunder.

  (b)            No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Shares, Company Series A Preferred Shares, Company Series B Preferred Shares or Partnership Units.

(c)           Termination of Exchange Fund.

(e)            Investment of Exchange Fund. After the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Company. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company. Until the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.5(c), to the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the cash portion of the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Company Share Merger Consideration, the Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration or the cash portion of the Partnership Unit Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Company shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make all such payments.   (f)            Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent and the taking of such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to, and subject to Section 2.5(c), the Surviving Company) will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Company Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series A Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the Per Company Series B Preferred Share Merger Consideration or the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect thereof, in accordance with this Agreement.   Section 2.6            Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, the Surviving Company, the Partnership, the Surviving Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment (and, with respect to the Company Options, the Company Restricted Share Awards, the Company Performance Units or the Company LTIP Units, the vesting and cancellation of such Company Options, the vesting of such Company Restricted Share Awards, the vesting and cancellation of such Company Performance Units or the treatment of such Company LTIP Units as set forth in Section 2.3) under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Company, the Surviving Company, the Partnership, the Surviving Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the Paying Agent, as applicable, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 Section 4.7             Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II.   (a)           All of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Merger Sub I are, and immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or one or more of its affiliates. Merger Sub I was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)           All of the issued and outstanding limited partnership interests in Merger Sub II are, and immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time will be, owned by Merger Sub I or its direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary to be designated by Parent prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time. Merger Sub II GP, is, and immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time will be, the sole general partner of Merger Sub II. Merger Sub II was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c)           None of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or any of their respective Subsidiaries owns any Excluded Shares or beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Company Shares or Partnership Units or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company Shares or Partnership Units, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Company Shares or Partnership Units, other than pursuant to this Agreement.   Section 4.8            Sufficient Funds.   (a)           Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the fully executed commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof (the “Equity Commitment Letter”), between Parent and the other parties thereto (each, an “Equity Investor”), pursuant to which each Equity Investor has committed, subject only to the terms and conditions of the applicable Equity Commitment Letter, to invest the amounts set forth therein on the Closing Date (the “Equity Financing”).   


 48     


  (b)           Assuming the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters, the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and the performance in all material respects by the Company and the Partnership of their obligations under this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent will have sufficient cash on hand to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and satisfy all of its obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the Surviving Company, any payments in respect of equity compensation obligations required to be made in connection with, or as a result of, the Mergers and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries required in connection therewith.   (c)           Each Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been (and will not be prior to the Closing or valid termination of this Agreement) withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified (or is contemplated to be amended, supplemented or modified) in any respect. Each Equity Commitment Letter, in the form delivered to the Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of all the parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and the applicable Equity Investor in accordance with and subject to its terms and conditions, except as enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There are no side letters, understandings or other Contracts or arrangements relating to the Equity Commitment Letters that could affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Equity Financing. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default or breach by Parent under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Equity Commitment Letters or otherwise result in any portion of the Equity Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to Section 1.5. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, the performance in all material respects by the Company and the Partnership of their obligations under this Agreement and the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it or the Equity Investors would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letters required to be satisfied by Parent or the Equity Investors, as applicable. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Equity Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the investing of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Equity Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s, Merger Sub I’s or Merger Sub II’s obligations under this Agreement.   (d)            In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing) by Parent or any of its affiliates or any other financing be a condition to any of Parent’s obligations under this Agreement.   


 49

Each Guaranty is in full force and effect, has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the applicable Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with and subject to its terms and conditions, except as enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default, breach or a failure to satisfy a condition under the terms and conditions on the part of a Guarantor under the applicable Guaranty. Each Guarantor has, and at all times will have, for so long as the applicable Guaranty shall remain in effect in accordance with the applicable Guaranty, access to sufficient capital to satisfy in full the full amount of the guaranteed obligations under such Guaranty. The provisions of this Section 4.9 do not limit the express representations of each Guarantor contained in the applicable Guaranty.   Section 4.10           Solvency. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II to consummate the Mergers set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied or waived, (b) the representations and warranties set forth in Article III are true and correct, and (c) the most recent financial projections or forecasts provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were reasonable at such time, then at and immediately following the Company Merger Effective Time and after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the funding of the Equity Financing, Parent, the Surviving Company and each Subsidiary of the Surviving

In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted in writing to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

  (b)            Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers as promptly as practicable and to cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement, including, consistent with the foregoing, (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with the objective of being in a position to consummate the Mergers as promptly as practicable following the date of the Company Shareholders’ Meeting, all documentation to effect all necessary or advisable applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Entity or third party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any that are required to be obtained under any federal, state or local Law or Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, (ii) contesting, litigating and defending all lawsuits or other legal proceedings against it or any of its affiliates relating to or challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers (“Transaction Litigation”), and (iii) effecting all necessary or advisable registrations and other filings required under the Exchange Act or any other federal, state or local Law relating to the Mergers.

In the event that any party hereto fails to obtain any such consent, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent and their respective affiliates

The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of the initiation of and any material developments regarding, and shall reasonably consult with and permit Parent and its Representatives to participate in the defense, negotiations or settlement of, any Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall give consideration to Parent’s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Company Subsidiaries nor any of its or their Representatives to, compromise or settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).   (f)            Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary so that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Promptly after the No-Shop Period Start Date (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), the Company shall (i) request each Person (other than Parent, its affiliates and their respective Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with any Inquiry, Company Acquisition Proposal or its consideration of any Company Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy all non-public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and (ii) terminate any data room or other diligence access to each such Person (and its Representatives); provided, that the Company shall not be required to take any such action in respect of any Excluded Party unless and until such Person or group ceases to be an Excluded Party (in which case all references in this sentence to the No-Shop Period Start Date shall be read as the date on which such Person or group ceases to be an Excluded Party).

  (b)            Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party) or as expressly permitted by this Section 5.6, from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors to, and shall direct its and their other Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations, discussions, negotiations or communications with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party) or as expressly permitted by this Section 5.6, from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII and the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors not to, and shall not authorize and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their other Representatives, not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer, request or proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal (an “Inquiry”), (B) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any third party any non-public information in connection with, or knowingly facilitate in any way any effort by, any third party in furtherance of any Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, (C) approve or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, (D) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, expense reimbursement agreement, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar definitive agreement providing for or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company or the Partnership to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any of the foregoing referred in this clause (D), other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”), or (E) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the commencement of the Company’s obligations under Section 5.6(b) and Section 5.6(c) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the parties hereto agree that the Company and its Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 5.6(a) with respect to each Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party) following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, including with respect to any amended or revised Company Acquisition Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date and the restrictions in Section 5.6(b) or Section 5.6(c) shall not apply with respect to an Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party).   (c)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly, through any Representative, in response to an unsolicited written bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal by a third party (including any Person or group of Persons who has ceased to be an Excluded Party, after such Person or group of Persons has ceased to be an Excluded Party, and such Company Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to be solicited by reason of the fact that such Person or group of Persons was solicited while an Excluded Party) made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.6, it being agreed that the Company may correspond in writing with any Person making such a written Company Acquisition Proposal to request clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal) (i) furnish non-public information to such third party (and such third party’s Representatives, including potential financing sources) making such Company Acquisition Proposal (provided, however, that (A) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms no more favorable in any material respect to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions that would prohibit the making or amendment of any non- public Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board (such confidentiality agreement, an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”), and (B) any non- public information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to such third party (or its Representatives) shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, be provided to Parent as promptly as practicable after providing it to such third party (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours thereafter)), and (ii) engage in, enter into or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with such third party (and such third party’s Representatives) with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.   


 66     


  (d)            From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any third party that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any other Inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company regarding a possible Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made in writing and shall identify the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and indicate the material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposals or Inquiries, to the extent known (including, if applicable, providing copies of any written Company Acquisition Proposals or Inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto, which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the business or operations of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry). The Company shall also promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent, in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Company Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information to any Person in each case in accordance with Section 5.6(c), notify Parent of any change to the financial and other material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal and otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry on a reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all written proposals, offers, drafts of proposed agreements or correspondence relating thereto (which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the business or operations of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidential or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may (A) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if an Intervening Event has occurred and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (B) if the Company has not breached this Section 5.6(e) or Section 5.6(f) (other than, in the case of Section 5.6(f) any breach that has a de minimis effect) and has not breached the other subsections of this Section 5.6 in any material respect, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) if the Company Board has received (x) after the date hereof and prior to the Cut-Off Time from an Excluded Party a Company Acquisition Proposal or (y) after the No-Shop Period Start Date, an unsolicited written bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal that, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), did not result from a breach of this Section 5.6 and in the good faith determination of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied (other than any non-compliance that has a de minimis effect) with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to Section 5.6(f), and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn.   (f)            The Company Board shall only be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) as permitted under Section 5.6(e) if (i) the Company has provided a prior written notice (a “Notice of Change of Recommendation”) to Parent that the Company intends to take such action, identifying the Person making the Superior Proposal and describing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, that is the basis of such action, including, if applicable, copies of any written proposals or offers and any proposed written agreements related to a Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parent’s receipt of the Notice of Change of Recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such 3rd Business Day (a “Notice of Change Period”), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, or, in the case of an Intervening Event, in order to obviate the need to make such Adverse Recommendation Change; and (iii) following the end of the Notice of Change Period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Change of Recommendation or otherwise, that (A) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Change of Recommendation continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such a Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation, and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.6(f); provided, however, that the Notice of Change Period shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of Change of Recommendation and ending at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on such 2nd Business Day.

(h)            The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Company Subsidiary to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, except solely to allow the applicable party to make a non- public Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board or to allow the disclosure of information to financing sources and/or teaming arrangements. Other than in connection with the consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall not take any actions to exempt any person from the “Common Stock Ownership Limit” or “Preferred Stock Ownership Limit” or establish or increase an “Excepted Holder Limit,” as such terms are defined in the Company Charter unless such actions are taken concurrently with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(i).

(a)            From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an “Indemnified Party” and collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, actions, suits, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next sentence, amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time), including in connection with the consideration, negotiation and approval of this Agreement, to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or fiduciary under benefit plans, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement (the “Indemnified Liabilities”), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Company Merger Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such person’s rights under this Section 5.8; provided, that (x) none of the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership shall be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (y) except for legal counsel engaged for one or more Indemnified Parties on the date hereof, none of the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership shall be obligated under this Section 5.8(a) to pay the fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single legal action except to the extent that, on the advice of any such Indemnified Party’s counsel, two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the Company Merger Effective Time), the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership, as applicable, shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly, and in any event within ten (10) days, after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred (provided that, if legally required, the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non- appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under applicable Law).

  (b)            Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain the Company’s officers’ and directors’ liability insurance policies in effect on the date hereof (accurate and complete copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) (the “D&O Insurance”) for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date; provided that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts with reputable and financially sound carriers containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers so long as such substitution does not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time; provided further that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to pay annual premiums in the aggregate of more than an amount equal to 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the “Maximum Amount”) to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; provided further that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Company shall procure and maintain for such six-year period the most advantageous policies as can be reasonably obtained for the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall have the option to cause coverage to be extended under the Company’s D&O Insurance by obtaining a six-year “tail” policy or policies on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the Company’s existing D&O Insurance, subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos above in this Section 5.8(b), and such “tail” policy or policies shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 5.8(b).   (c)            The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.8 shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the Mergers and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.8 applies (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8, each of whom (including his or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her Representatives, successors and assigns) may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.8) without the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and heirs of such Indemnified Party) affected thereby. In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Company, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.   


 71     


  (d)            For a period of not less than six (6) years from the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership shall provide to the Indemnified Parties the same rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided to the Indemnified Parties under the provisions of the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ charter, bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect as of the date hereof and the Surviving Company’s and the Surviving Partnership’s charter, bylaws or similar organizational documents shall not contain any provisions inconsistent with such rights. The contractual indemnification rights set forth in Section 5.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Company Merger Effective Time.   (e)            The provisions of this Section 5.8 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 5.8, is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.8 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.   Section 5.9             Employee Matters.   (a)            From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, for the period ending on the first anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time (or, if shorter, during any applicable period of employment), Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, to provide to each individual who is an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and who continues employment with the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company following the Company Merger Effective Time (each, a “Company Employee”), (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate in effect with respect to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation and benefits (including severance benefits, paid-time off, health insurance, and equity-based compensation but excluding other long-term incentive compensation;








________________


provided, that such equity-based compensation may be subject to performance-vesting terms with respect to a percentage thereof that is the same as (or lower than) the percentage of equity-based compensation provided to such Company Employee in the immediately preceding year that was subject to performance- vesting terms) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee, immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.   


 72     


  (b)            With respect to each benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, following the Closing and in which any of the Company Employees participate (each, a “Parent Plan”), and except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary and the predecessor of any of them shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable) and entitlement to benefits including any paid time off and severance plans (but not for accrual of or entitlement to pension benefits, post-employment welfare benefits, special or early retirement programs, window separation programs, or similar plans which may be in effect from time to time), to the extent such service was recognized by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the date hereof. Parent shall take all necessary actions so that each Company Employee shall after the Company Merger Effective Time continue to be credited with the unused paid time off credited to such employee through the Company Merger Effective Time under the applicable paid time off policies of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (subject to the same forfeiture conditions and accrual limits as applicable prior to the Company Merger Effective Time).   (c)            Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, as the case may be, to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting periods or any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the health and welfare plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to such Company Employee with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to all Company Employees and their dependents under any Parent Plan that is a welfare plan that such Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date, other than limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting periods or other restrictions that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any Company Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such Company Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Company Employees under the comparable Company Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) provide each such Company Employee and his or her dependents with full credit for any co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing Date for the plan year within which the Company Merger Effective Time occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, and for any lifetime maximums, under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.

  (d)            On and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership to honor all Company Employee Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time (subject to any rights to terminate, amend or modify such Company Employee Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms).   (e)            If the Company Merger Effective Time occurs prior to the date on which the Company pays annual bonuses for the 2021 performance year, then Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay a bonus to each Company Employee who is otherwise eligible to receive an annual bonus for 2021 (the “2021 Bonus”); provided, that 2021 Bonus payments shall be (i) based on the 2021 bonus plan and targets in effect as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (ii) determined reasonably and in good faith by the Company (or, following the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Company) in the ordinary course of business; provided, that the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to determine the appropriate treatment of the operating funds from operations performance metrics and (iii) paid by the Company (or, following the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Company) at the same time that such annual bonuses are typically paid in the ordinary course of business.   (f)            Without limiting the generality of Section 8.6, no provision of this Section 5.9, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person (including any Company Employee and any dependent or beneficiary thereof) other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, (ii) shall constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Company Employee Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) is intended to prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or terminating the employment of any Company Employee.

(b)            (i) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, if (x) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the applicable closing conditions would reasonably be expected to be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (y) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement and (ii) the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent if the Company becomes aware that any material Company IT Assets have suffered a material security breach that results in unauthorized access or restriction imposed by a third party to customer or Company data; provided, however, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), no such notification (nor any good faith failure to provide such notification) shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement and shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

The Company shall not be deemed to have made an Adverse Recommendation Change or entered into or agreed to enter an Alternative Acquisition Agreement as a result of providing any cooperation or taking any actions to the extent requested by Parent in connection with a Parent-Approved Transaction.

termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), such Company Acquisition Proposal or publicly proposed or announced intention shall have been made prior to the Company Shareholders’ Meeting) and (y) within twelve (12) months after a termination referred to in this Section 7.3(b)(iii) the Company enters into a definitive agreement relating to, or consummates, any Company Acquisition Proposal (with, for purposes of this clause (y), the references to “15%” in the definition of “Company Acquisition Proposal” being deemed to be references to “50%”),   then the Company shall pay as directed by Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent. The payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made (1) in the case of a payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(i), within two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination by Parent, (2) in the case of a payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(ii), prior to or concurrently with such termination by the Company and (3) in the case of a payment pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(iii), within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of entry into a definitive agreement relating to the Company Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (y) of Section 7.3(b)(iii) and consummation of such Company Acquisition Proposal. “Company Termination Fee” means Two Hundred Twenty Million Dollars ($220,000,000), except that the Company Termination Fee shall be One Hundred Twenty-Eight Million dollars ($128,000,000) in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) prior to the Cut-Off Time in order to enter into a definitive agreement with an Excluded Party providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal.   (c)           In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or Section 7.1(c)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) and the Company was then entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or Section 7.1(c)(iii), then Parent shall, within three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by the Company, an amount equal to Eight Hundred Five Million Dollars ($805,000,000) (the “Parent Termination Amount”).   


 86     


  (d)           The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that (x) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (y) the Parent Termination Amount is not a penalty, but rather is the amount that Parent has agreed to pay the Company, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Parent’s breach or other failure to consummate the Mergers pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or Section 7.1(c)(iii), for release from its agreement and settlement of its obligation to consummate the Mergers (and acquire, for U.S. federal, and applicable state and local, income tax purposes, all of the Company’s assets) in accordance herewith and compensates the Company for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers. If Parent receives the full payment of the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(b) under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee was payable, the receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their respective affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. In the event that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, is required to commence litigation to seek all or a portion of the amounts payable under this Section 7.3, and it prevails in such litigation, it shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all amounts that it is otherwise entitled to receive under this Section 7.3, all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) which it has incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder, together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Amount, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be made. The parties agree that in no event shall (i) Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Amount on more than one occasion or (ii) the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.   


 87     


  Section 7.4            Payment of Amount or Expense.   (a)            In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Amount pursuant to Section 7.3(c) (the “Section 7.3 Amount”), Parent shall pay to the Company from the applicable Section 7.3 Amount deposited into escrow, if any, in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the Section 7.3 Amount and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (“Qualifying Income”), as determined by the Company’s independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the Company receives either (X) a letter from the Company’s counsel indicating that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 7.4(b)(ii) or (Y) an opinion from the Company’s outside counsel as described in Section 7.4(b)(ii), an amount equal to the Section 7.3 Amount less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure Parent’s obligation to pay these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Section 7.3 Amount with an escrow agent selected by the Company and on such terms (subject to Section 7.4(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent as reflected in an escrow agreement among such parties, provided that the payment or deposit into escrow shall be at the Company’s option. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Section 7.3 Amount pursuant to this Section 7.4(a) shall be made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Company such amount pursuant to Section 7.3(c) by wire transfer of same day funds.   (b)           The escrow agreement shall provide that the Section 7.3 Amount in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Company’s independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code in such year determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Company’s accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Company’s counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company of the Section 7.3 Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Company’s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Section 7.3 Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Section 7.3 Amount to the Company. Parent agrees to amend this Section 7.4 at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Section 7.3 Amount that may be distributed to the Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Company’s chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 7.4(b) or (z) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 7.4(b). Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.4 so long as it deposits into escrow the Section 7.3 Amount, notwithstanding any delay or reduction in payment to the Company, and shall have no further liability with respect to payment of the Section 7.3 Amount. The portion of Section 7.3 Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section 7.3. The Company shall fully indemnify Parent and hold Parent harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by it

  Section 8.5            Interpretation; Certain Definitions. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, exhibit or schedule, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an exhibit or schedule to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word “extent” in the phrase, “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. Any references to any Contract are to such Contract as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time. References to a Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All references to “dollars” or “$” refer to currency of the United States of America. All references to wholly owned Company Subsidiaries shall mean the Partnership and any Company Subsidiary directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Partnership. All references to the “ordinary course of business” shall mean the “ordinary course of business consistent with past practice”.   Section 8.6            Parties In Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in Section 5.8, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 5.8 shall not arise unless and until the Company Merger Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.10 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.   Section 8.7            Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.   


 93     


    Section 8.8      Specific Performance.   (a)       The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Company or the Partnership do not perform any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with the Agreement’s specified terms or otherwise breaches such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by the Company and the Partnership and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief on the basis that any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent a breach or breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with the request for or grant of any such order or injunction. Each of the Company and the Partnership agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. The parties hereto agree that neither the Company nor the Partnership shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and that the Company’s and the Partnership’s sole and exclusive remedy relating to a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in Section 7.3(c), as set forth in the penultimate sentence of Section 7.3(d) and indemnification, payment and reimbursement pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5.12 and the last sentence of Section 5.15(a); provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent of Section 5.2(b).   


 94     


  (b)       The parties further agree (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to Section 8.8(a) shall not in any respect constitute a waiver by any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking such remedies of its respective right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under Section 7.3, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in Section 8.8(a) are not available or otherwise not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to institute any proceeding for (or limit any of Parent’s, Merger Sub I’s or Merger Sub II’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.8 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding by any of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II seeking remedies pursuant to Section 8.8(a) or anything set forth in this Section 8.8 restrict or limit Parent’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.   (c)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger

Sub II together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company or the Partnership or their affiliates relating to the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, or a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the Parent Termination Amount, plus (ii) amounts payable or reimbursable pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Section 7.3(d), plus (iii) Parent’s indemnification, payment and reimbursement obligations pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5.12 and the last sentence of Section 5.15(a) (collectively, the “Liability Limitation”), and in no event shall the Company or the Partnership or any of their affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Parties (other than Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to the extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Infrastructure Advisors L.L.C. and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement), through Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II against any Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Guarantors (but not any other Parent Party) under and to the extent provided in the Guaranties and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein. Recourse against the Guarantors under the Guaranties shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Partnership and their respective affiliates against the Guarantors and any other Parent Party (other than Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to the extent provided in this Agreement and Blackstone Infrastructure Advisors L.L.C. and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II hereunder and Blackstone Infrastructure Advisors L.L.C. and Blackstone Real Estate Services L.L.C. under the Confidentiality Agreement, in no event shall the Company or its affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from, any Parent Party (other than the Guarantors to the extent provided in the Guaranties and subject to the Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein).   


 95     


  Section 8.9         Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II at any time before or after approval of the Mergers by the Company Requisite Vote but, after such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of any such shareholders under applicable Law without obtaining such further approvals. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties hereto.   Section 8.10       Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing Date, each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any breaches or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) subject to Section 8.9, waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, the Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.   Section 8.11       Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including as provided in Exhibits B and C, Net Income and Net Loss, and to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner such that the Capital Account of each Partner, immediately after making such allocation and after taking into account actual distributions made during such Fiscal Year is, as nearly as possible, equal (proportionately) to (i) the distributions that would be made to such Partner pursuant to Section 5.1 if the Partnership were dissolved, its affairs wound up and its assets sold for cash equal to their Carrying Value (determined, for the avoidance of doubt, without adjustment for the hypothetical liquidation described in this Section 6.1.A), all Partnership liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Carrying Value of the assets securing such liability) and the net assets of the Partnership were distributed in accordance with Section 5.1 (and not Section 13.2) to the Partners immediately after making such allocation, minus (ii) such Partner’s share of Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner Minimum Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may make such allocations as it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary for this purpose.   (e)           Section 6.1 of the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the existing Section 6.1.E and Section 6.1.F.

To exercise the Exchange Right, the Class A Unitholder that is exercising the Exchange Right (the “Exchange Partner”) shall deliver an Exchange Notice to BREIT OP (with a copy to the General Partner). Following receipt of an Exchange Notice, BREIT OP shall notify the relevant Exchange Partner of the Per Class A Unit Exchange Factor (the “Valuation Notice”) at least seven (7) days prior to the Exchange Date.

A Class A Unitholder may exercise the Exchange Right from time to time, without limitation as to frequency, from and after the Lock-up Expiry Date with respect to part or all of its Class A Units, as specified by such Class A Unitholder in the Exchange Notice (such number of Class A Units, the “Exchanged Class A Units”); provided, however, that an Exchange Partner may not exercise the Exchange Right for fewer than one thousand (1,000) Class A Units unless the Exchange Partner then holds fewer than one thousand (1,000) Class A Units, in which event the Exchange Partner must exercise the Exchange Right for all of the Class A Units held by the Exchange Partner; provided, further, that, with respect to a Class A Unitholder which is an entity, such Class A Unitholder may exercise the Exchange Right for fewer than one thousand (1,000) Class A Units without regard to whether or not such Class A Unitholder is exercising the Exchange Right for all of the Class A Units held by such Class A Unitholder as long as such Class A Unitholder is exercising the Exchange Right on behalf of one or more of its equity owners in respect of one hundred percent (100%) of such equity owners’ interests in such Class A Unitholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) a Class A Unitholder shall not deliver an Exchange Notice with respect to more than forty percent (40%) of such Class A Unitholder’s Initial Ownership Stake in the first twelve (12)-month period commencing on the Lock-up Expiry Date (together with any other Exchange Notices delivered in such twelve (12)-month period), seventy percent (70% of such Class A Unitholder’s Initial Ownership Stake in the first twenty four (24)-month period commencing on the Lock-up Expiry Date (together with any other Exchange Notices delivered in such twenty four (24)-month period), and any remainder thereafter and (ii) no Class A Unitholder shall be entitled to deliver an Exchange Notice or otherwise exercise its Exchange Right following delivery of a Drag Along Notice until such time as the related Drag Along Sale has been consummated, terminated or abandoned (as determined by the General Partner acting in good faith).

  (ii) In respect of each valid Exchange Notice delivered pursuant to Section 8.6.A(i), the contribution and exchange contemplated by Section 8.6.A(i) shall occur on the next Exchange Date, on which date BREIT OP shall issue to the Exchange Partner a number of BREIT OP Units as is equal to the Exchanged Class A Units specified in the applicable Exchange Notice multiplied by the Per Class A Unit Exchange Factor (such number of BREIT OP Units, the “Exchanged BREIT OP Units”), which Exchanged BREIT OP Units shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free and clear of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or restriction, other than those provided in the organizational documents of BREIT OP (including the BREIT OP LPA), the Securities Act and relevant state securities or blue sky laws.   (iii) The Assignee of any Class A Unitholder may exercise the rights of such Class A Unitholder pursuant to this Section 8.6, and such Class A Unitholder shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Class A Unitholder’s Assignee. In connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of such Class A Unitholder, the Exchanged BREIT OP Units shall be issued directly to such Assignee and not to such Class A Unitholder.   (iv) Upon the consummation of the contribution and exchange contemplated by an Exchange Notice, (x) BREIT OP shall acquire the Exchanged Class A Units specified in such Exchange Notice and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of, and shall be admitted to the Partnership as a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to, such Exchanged Class A Units and (y) the Exchange Partner shall have no right to receive any distributions paid in respect of a Partnership Record Date after the Exchange Date with respect to such Exchanged Class A Units. The General Partner hereby consents to the admission of BREIT OP as a Substituted Limited Partner in respect of the Exchanged Class A Units in accordance with Section 11.4, and the General Partner shall update the Partner Registry in the books and records of the Partnership as it deems necessary to reflect such admission in the Partner Registry.   (v) Each Class A Unitholder acknowledges and agrees that (x) any exchange of BREIT OP Units pursuant to this Section 8.6 may require the execution and delivery by such holder of (A) a Private Placement Purchase Agreement with BREIT OP, as well as certain legal, tax and regulatory considerations as further described therein, (B) a joinder to the BREIT OP LPA and (C) other reasonable, customary or otherwise legally-required documentation requested by BREIT or BREIT OP in connection with the exchange and acquisition of BREIT OP Units (including ultimate beneficial owner identification, as reasonably necessary), (y) any holder of BREIT OP Units is subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions and other provisions of the BREIT OP LPA (including, without limitation, the terms set forth in the BREIT OP LPA relating to redemption rights) and (z) neither the Partnership nor the General Partner shall have any obligation to any Exchange Partner with respect to the Exchange Partner’s exercise of the Exchange Right.

In addition, the General Partner may, with the prior written consent of BREIT OP, with respect to any Class A Unitholder, at any time and from time to time, as it shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) reduce or waive the length of the period prior to which such Class A Unitholder may not exercise the Exchange Right or (ii) reduce or waive the length of the period between the exercise of the Exchange Right and the Exchange Date.

(i) If either (x) any member or group of members of the Sponsor Group proposes to transfer its equity securities or other interests in Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries that holds equity securities or other interests in the General Partner or (y) the General Partner proposes to transfer its Class A Units (such proposed transferor, the “Selling Party”) (a “Tag Along Sale ”), the General Partner shall, prior to the consummation of such transfer, give written notice to each other Class A Unitholder (the “ Prospective Tagging Limited Partners”) and the Partnership, which notice (the “Tag Along Notice”) shall (A) identify the Class A Units to be transferred in the Tag Along Sale (the “ Offered Securities”) and (B) describe the material terms and conditions of such Tag Along Sale, including the per unit price of Class A Units desired to be transferred and the identity of the transferee, if known, and furnish copies of all existing or proposed agreements with the transferee in respect of the Tag Along Sale. If equity securities or other interests in Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries that holds equity securities or other interests in the General Partner are the subject of the Tag Along Sale, the provisions of this Section 11.8 shall apply to the Class A Units beneficially owned by the Selling Party.   


12   


  (ii) Any one or more of the Prospective Tagging Limited Partners may, within 10 Business Days of the delivery of the Tag-Along Notice, give written notice (each, a “Tag Along Acceptance Notice ”) to the Selling Party that such Prospective Tagging Limited Partner wishes to participate in such Tag Along Sale on the same terms and conditions as the Selling Party (such Prospective Tagging Limited Partner, a “ Tagging Limited Partner”). A Tag Along Acceptance Notice shall specify the number of Class A Units such Prospective Tagging Limited Partner desires to include in such Tag Along Sale.   (iii) To exercise its tag-along rights hereunder, each Tagging Limited Partner must agree to make the same representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements, as applicable, as the Selling Party makes in connection with the Tag Along Sale (except that, in the case of representations and warranties pertaining specifically to, or covenants, indemnities or other agreements made specifically by, the Selling Party or any particular Tagging Limited Partner, each other Tagging Limited Partner shall make comparable representations and warranties pertaining specifically to (and covenants, indemnities or other agreements specifically by) such Tagging Limited Partner). Any escrow of sale or other disposition proceeds of any Tag Along Sale shall be withheld on a pro rata basis among the Selling Party and the Tagging Limited Partners (based on the relative proceeds payable in connection with such Tag Along Sale) on such terms as shall be reasonably determined by the Selling Party.   (iv) The offer of each Tagging Limited Partner contained in such Tagging Limited Partner’s Tag Along Acceptance Notice shall be irrevocable and, to the extent such offer is accepted by the transferee, such Tagging Limited Partner shall be obligated to sell its Class A Units in the proposed Tag Along Sale at the same price per Class A Unit and, subject t o clause (iii) above, on the same terms and conditions as the Selling Party sells the Offered Securities, as applicable, up to such number of Class A Units as such Tagging Limited Partner shall have specified in its Tag Along Acceptance Notice (such number of Class A Units, “Tagged Units”); provided, however, that if the terms of the proposed Tag Along Sale change such that the per Class A Unit price shall be less than the per Class A Unit price set forth in the Tag Along Notice, the form of consideration shall be different or the other terms and conditions shall be materially less favorable to any Tagging Limited Partner than those set forth in the Tag Along Notice, each Tagging Limited Partner that has previously delivered a Tag Along Acceptance Notice shall be permitted to withdraw the acceptance contained in such Tagging Limited Partner’s Tag Along Acceptance Notice by written notice to the Selling Party and upon such withdrawal shall be released from such Tagging Limited Partner’s obligations under this Section 11.8.   (v) Each Tagging Limited Partner will bear (x) its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Tag Along Sale and (y) its pro rata share (based on the relative proceeds payable in connection with such Tag Along Sale) of the costs and expenses incurred by the Selling Party in connection with the Tag Along Sale to the extent such costs are incurred for the benefit of both the Selling Party and the Tagging Limited Partners and are not otherwise paid by the transferee.   


13   


  (vi) If none of the Prospective Tagging Limited Partners give the Selling Party a timely Tag Along Acceptance Notice with respect to a Tag Along Sale, then the Selling Party may transfer the Offered Securities set forth in the Tag Along Notice for such Tag Along Sale at a per Class A Unit price, as applicable, no greater than the price set forth in the Tag Along Notice and on other terms and conditions not materially more favorable to the Selling Party than those set forth in the Tag Along Notice at any time within one hundred eighty (180) days (subject to extension to the extent necessary to obtain required governmental or other approvals) after the expiration of the 10 Business day period for giving Tag Along Acceptance Notices with respect to such Tag Along Sale. Any such Offered Securities not sold by the Selling Party during such period will again be subject to the provisions of this Section 11.8 upon a proposed subsequent transfer.   (vii) If one or more Prospective Tagging Limited Partners give the Selling Party a timely Tag Along Acceptance Notice, then the General Partner shall (and, if applicable, shall cause the Selling Party to) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of the prospective transferee(s) in the Tag Along Sale to the participation of the Tagging Limited Partners in the Tag Along Sale, on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to the Offered Securities. If the prospective transferee(s) is unwilling or unable to acquire all of the Offered Securities and all of the Tagged Units upon such terms, then the General Partner shall (and, if applicable, shall cause the Selling Party to) elect either to cancel such proposed Tag Along Sale or to allocate the maximum number of Class A Units that the prospective transferee(s) is willing to directly or indirectly acquire among the Selling Party and the Tagging Limited Partners giving timely Tag Along Acceptance Notices pro rata based on the number of Class A Units beneficially owned by the Selling Party and each Tagging Limited Partner relative to the aggregate number of Class A Units beneficially owned by the Selling Party, all Tagging Limited Partners and any other Persons participating in the proposed Tag Along Sale as tagging Limited Partners under other agreements, if any (it being acknowledged and agreed for purposes of this calculation that the Selling Party shall be deemed to hold all Class A Units beneficially owned by the Sponsor Group (including the General Partner). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, in no event shall the Selling Party or any Tagging Limited Partner be entitled, or required, to transfer a number of Class A Units in excess of the number of Offered Securities (in the case of the Selling Party) or the number of such Tagging Limited Party’s Tagged Units (in the case of a Tagging Limited Partner).   (viii) The Selling Party shall, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to pursue, consummate, postpone or abandon any Tag Along Sale and the terms and conditions thereof. No Partner (nor any member of the Sponsor Group) nor any Affiliate of any such Partner shall have any duty or

liability to any other Partner or the Partnership arising from, relating to or in connection with the pursuit, consummation, postponement, abandonment or terms and conditions of any Tag Along Sale, except to the extent such Partner shall have failed to comply with the provisions of this Section 11.8.

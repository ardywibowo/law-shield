On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue its corporate existence under the Laws of the State of Delaware as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”).

  Section 1.2     Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place remotely at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the sixth (6th) business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing.

The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”).   Section 1.4     Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Subject to Section 5.9, at the Effective Time, (a) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Company shall be amended to read in its entirety as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub read immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be “Varian Medical Systems, Inc.” and the provision in the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub naming its incorporator shall be omitted, and (b) the Amended and Restated By- laws of the Company shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as the By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law, except that the references to Merger Sub’s name shall be replaced by references to “Varian Medical Systems, Inc.”   Section 1.6     Directors.

  ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 2.1     Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:   (a)          Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, “Company Common Stock” or “Shares” and each, a “Share”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled or recapitalized pursuant to Section 2.1(b), (ii) Dissenting Shares, and (iii) Shares underlying or comprising unexercised, unvested or unsettled Company Equity Awards) shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $177.50 in cash without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any required Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.2(b)(iii). All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.   (b)          Parent, Merger Sub and Subsidiary-Owned Shares. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties (other than Shares held by any “rabbi trust” or similar arrangement in respect of any compensation plan or arrangement, which will be treated the same as shares held directly by a party hereto)) (the “Cancelled Shares”) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement. Each Share that is owned by a Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) shall be converted into that number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time as the value such Share bore to the aggregate value of all outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (c)          Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted, which, together with the shares of common stock referred to above in the second sentence of Section 2.1(b), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  (d)          Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead, at the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws, waives or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (it being understood that at the Effective Time such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding). If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws, waives or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a), without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares (and of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to such demand) and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, and shall not agree to, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or compromise rights with respect to any such demands.   (e)          Adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or similar event, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. Nothing in this Section 2.1(e) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.   Section 2.2     Exchange of Certificates.   (a)          Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent to act as a paying agent hereunder and that shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (and appointed pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares (other than the Cancelled Shares), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (“Certificates”) (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Equity Award Consideration will not be deposited with the Paying Agent and will be paid in accordance with Section 5.5.

  (b)          Payment Procedures.   (i)            As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and otherwise shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) (provided that if the Paying Agent does not customarily require a letter of transmittal with respect to book-entry shares, no letter of transmittal shall be required to be mailed to such holders), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.   (ii)           Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or delivery of an “agent’s message” in respect of Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal (if required), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares formerly represented by such holder’s properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, subject to all required Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.2(b)(iii). No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares. In the event that any transfer or other similar Taxes become payable by reason of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, or otherwise because of the payment of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder, cash in U.S. dollars to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to the holder or transferee with respect to such Shares if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.   (iii)          Each of the Paying Agent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any provision of U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  (c)          Closing of Transfer Books. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are validly presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.   (d)          Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.   (e)           No Liability. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. If any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) shall not have been surrendered prior to five (5) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, pursuant to this Article II, would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (f)           Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that (i) any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government and (ii) any loss of any of the funds included in the Exchange Fund shall be for the account of Parent and shall not alter Parent’s obligations to pay the Merger Consideration. Any amounts in the Exchange Fund in excess of the amount required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement shall promptly be paid to Parent (or such other person as Parent may designate).   (g)          Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an amount in cash in U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any Tax withholding as provided in Section 2.2(b)(iii)) equal to the number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II.

As used in this Agreement, any reference to any developments, occurrences, events, changes, effects, circumstances, conditions, facts or state of facts having a “Company Material Adverse Effect” means such developments, occurrences, events, changes, effects, circumstances, conditions, facts or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate, are materially adverse to the business, financial condition or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, provided, that any of the following will not be taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur: (i) any changes in general United States or global economic or political conditions, (ii) changes in the securities, credit or financial markets, (iii) general changes or developments in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or the industries to which the Company and its Subsidiaries sell their products, solutions and services, (iv) (I) changes or proposed changes of Laws or regulations or (II) any quarantine, “shelter in place,” “stay at home,” workforce reduction, social distancing, shut down, closure, sequester, safety or similar Law, directive, guidelines or recommendations promulgated by any Governmental Entity, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, in each case, in connection with or in response to COVID-19 (“COVID-19 Measures”), (v) the announcement of this Agreement or the pendency or consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including any loss or change in relationship with any employee, officer, director, customer, supplier, vendor, reseller, distributor, or other business partner of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (vi) the identity of Parent or any of its affiliates as the acquiror of the Company, (vii) compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required by, this Agreement or consented to in writing by Parent, Siemens Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or requested in writing by Siemens Parent, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (viii) geopolitical conditions, political unrest, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, acts of war (whether or not declared), acts of armed hostility, sabotage, terrorism or national or international calamity (or escalation or worsening of any such conditions or occurrences), (ix) hurricanes, tornados, floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, nuclear incidents, pandemics (including SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, and any evolutions or mutations thereof or related or associated epidemics, pandemics or disease outbreaks (“COVID-19”)), epidemics or other outbreaks of diseases, quarantine restrictions, weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters or other force majeure events or occurrences (or escalation or worsening of any such events or occurrences), (x) changes in generally accepted accounting principles or interpretations thereof, (xi) any stockholder litigation relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (xii) any decline in the stock price of the Company Common Stock or any failure to meet internal, published or other projections, forecasts or revenue or earning predictions for any period (provided that the underlying causes of such decline or failure may be considered, in and of themselves, in determining whether there is or has been a Company Material Adverse Effect), except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (viii) or (ix) (other than, in the case of clauses (iv) or (ix), any developments, occurrences, events, changes, effects, circumstances, conditions, facts or state of facts with respect to COVID-19 or the COVID-19 Measures or any escalation or worsening thereof (including any second or subsequent wave(s)) to the extent (and, for the avoidance of doubt, only to the extent) such developments, occurrences, events, changes, effects, circumstances, conditions, facts or state of facts referred to therein (I) are not otherwise excluded from the definition hereof and (II) have a disproportionate adverse impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other similarly situated companies in the industries and in the geographic markets in which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct their businesses.

  Section 5.2           Access.   (a)          Subject to applicable Law (including COVID-19 Measures), the Company shall afford to Parent and to its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice, during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to its and its Subsidiaries’ properties, officers, employees, Contracts, commitments, books and records and any report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly all other information in its possession concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to afford such access or provide such information if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, would, in light of COVID-19 or COVID-19 Measures, jeopardize the health and safety of any officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would reasonably be expected to cause a loss of privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a manner that would not violate applicable Law or any Contract or waive such privilege or work-product doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Representatives shall not be permitted to perform any onsite procedure (including any onsite environmental study) with respect to any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b)           Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2020, between the Company and Siemens Parent (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).

  Section 5.3            No Solicitation.   (a)          Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.3 set forth below, the Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall direct and cause its and its Subsidiaries’ officers, employees, and Representatives acting at the Company’s direction or on its behalf not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or participate in any negotiations with any person (other than Parent and its Representatives) regarding, or furnish any nonpublic information or access to any person (other than Parent and its Representatives) with respect to, any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal with any person (other than Parent and its Representatives) that has made or, to the Company’s knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Proposal, except to notify any person that has submitted an Alternative Proposal as to the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.3, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend or propose to approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal or any person becoming an “interested stockholder” under Section 203 of the DGCL (other than Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (v) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.3(b)), or (vi) agree to do or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing other than in compliance with this Agreement. The Company shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any person (other than Parent and its Representatives) with respect to an Alternative Proposal or potential Alternative Proposal and promptly terminate access granted to any third party or its Representatives to any electronic data room maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and in any event within thirty-six (36) hours following the date hereof). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not voluntarily release any third party that entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a possible Alternative Proposal from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, (x) any standstill provision in any such agreement or (y) any confidentiality provision in any such agreement other than, with respect to clause (x), to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.   (b)          Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.3(a) and subject to Section 5.3(c), if the Company receives an Alternative Proposal prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval that did not result from a material breach of Section 5.3 with respect to which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party (including such third party’s Representatives) making such Alternative Proposal, if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party an executed agreement having provisions requiring such party to keep such information confidential that are substantially similar to the comparable confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such agreement need not have comparable standstill provisions) (provided that the Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives), and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including such third party’s Representatives) with respect to the Alternative Proposal.

The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with or otherwise complying with this Section 5.3.   (d)           Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(d), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or resolve to or publicly propose to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Recommendation, (ii) approve or publicly propose to approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 5.3(b)) relating to any Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or resolve to or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal or a definitive agreement providing for an Alternative Proposal (a “Company Acquisition Agreement”), (iv) fail to include in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation, (v) fail to recommend against any Alternative Proposal (including by taking no position or a neutral position with respect to such Alternative Proposal) that is a tender or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) business days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender or exchange offer or (vi) fail to publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within ten (10) business days of Parent’s written request to do so following the public disclosure of an Alternative Proposal (other than an Alternative Proposal involving a tender or exchange offer addressed in clause (v)) (provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company shall only be required to make such reaffirmation on one occasion with respect to any one Alternative Proposal (with each material amendment to the price or terms of such Alternative Proposal triggering one additional Parent right to request reaffirmation)) (any of the foregoing actions in clauses (i) through (vi), a “Change of Recommendation”). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to an Alternative Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section 5.3, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (1) such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then (x) the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Change of Recommendation and/or authorize or cause the Company to take the actions in the following clause (y), and/or (y) the Company may, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, terminate this Agreement and concurrently with such termination enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, provided that prior to taking any such action: (A) the Company provides Parent four (4) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include the information with respect to such Superior Proposal that is specified in Section 5.3(b) (it being understood that each time any material revision or amendment to the terms of the Alternative Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal is made, the four (4) business day period shall be extended for an additional three (3) business days after notification of such change in accordance with Section 5.3(b) and this Section 5.3(d) to Parent); (B) during the applicable period described in clause (A) (the “Takeover Notice Period”), the Company considers and discusses with Parent in good faith any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent; and (C) at the end of the Takeover Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the Company again makes the determination in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and after taking into account any adjustments or modifications proposed by Parent during the Takeover Notice Period), that the Alternative Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, effect a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if: (i) the Company provides Parent four (4) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include all material information with respect to any such Intervening Event and a description of the Board of Directors of the Company’s rationale for such action; (ii) during such four (4) business day period described in clause (x), the Company considers and discusses in good faith with Parent and its Representatives any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement; and (z) at the end of the four (4) business day period described in clause (x), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel (after taking into account any adjustments or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during the period described in clause (x)) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f)           As used in this Agreement, “Alternative Proposal” shall mean any bona fide proposal or offer made by any person or group of related persons (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) for (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group of related persons would beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, twenty percent (20%) or more (on a non-diluted basis) of Company Common Stock, (ii) the acquisition by any person of a business or assets (including any capital stock or other securities) that constitutes or includes twenty (20%) or more of the consolidated assets, net revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) the issuance to or acquisition by any person of twenty percent (20%) (on a non-diluted basis) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (iv) a tender offer, exchange offer or any other transaction or series of transactions that, if consummated, would result in any person or group of related persons, directly or indirectly, beneficially owning or having the right to acquire beneficial ownership of capital stock or other equity interests representing twenty percent (20%) or more (on a non-diluted basis) of Company Common Stock.

(i)            Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a “Company Stock Option”) and each stock appreciation right granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a “Company SAR”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any such Company Stock Option or Company SAR, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or Company SAR and (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or Company SAR, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash hereinafter referred to as the “Option and SAR Consideration”) less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock underlying a Company Stock Option or Company SAR equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option or Company SAR shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof shall have no further rights with respect thereto.

(iv)          At the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent sufficient funds are not available at the Company, deposit the Equity Award Consideration (or funds sufficient to make up any shortfall) with the Company for the benefit of the holders of Company Stock Plans and Company Stock-Based Awards and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay the Equity Award Consideration through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation to such holders as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than three (3) business days) following the Effective Time.   (b)          Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company may continue to operate the ESPP in accordance with its terms, in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, following the date of this Agreement; provided, that the Company shall not, in any event, after the date of this Agreement: (i) initiate any new offering or offering period under the ESPP other than any to replace an expiring offering or offering period (as applicable) on substantially the same terms and conditions as such expiring offering or offering period (as applicable), and/or (ii) increase the aggregate number of shares available for purchase under the ESPP following the date of this Agreement (it being understood that this proviso shall not be construed to limit an increase in shares that are purchased as a result of variations in employee participation rates or elections or stock price fluctuations). With respect to each option then-outstanding under the ESPP, the fifth (5th) business day immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically deemed to be a “Purchase Date” (as defined within the ESPP) and all then-outstanding options granted under the ESPP will be exercised on such date in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP. Following the exercise of all outstanding options, the Company will cause the ESPP (x) not to commence an offering period following the fifth (5th) business day immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) to terminate as of the Effective Time.

For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues in employment with Parent or one of its affiliates following the Effective Time (each, a “Company Employee”), (A) an annual base salary or wage rate, as applicable, at least equal to the annual base salary or wage rate, as applicable, provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) cash incentive opportunities (excluding any equity or equity-linked incentive opportunities) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the cash incentive opportunities provided to such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (C) health, welfare and retirement benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension benefits (whether or not tax-qualified) in the United States and any excess benefit or supplemental executive retirement benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the health, welfare and retirement benefits provided to such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Company Employee (excluding each Continuing Employee who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is party to an individual agreement or arrangement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that entitles such Continuing Employee to superior severance payments or benefits, including any Change in Control Agreement (as defined in the Company Disclosure Schedule)) whose employment is terminated by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (including the Company) in a severance-qualifying termination as set forth on Section 5.5(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule during such one (1)-year period, severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than the applicable severance payments and benefits set forth on Section 5.5(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (subject to timely execution of an effective release in a form prescribed by Parent (provided that such form shall not impose non-competition or customer non-solicitation covenants on the applicable Company Employee, or any other material restrictions, that would not have applied under the Company’s standard form of release of claims in effect as of the date hereof for the applicable Company Employee), and taking into account the service crediting provisions of Section 5.5(c)(ii)).   (ii)            For all purposes (including purposes of vesting under any tax-qualified retirement plan, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any final average pay defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted under the terms of the New Plans, (A) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall ensure that each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any New Plans applicable to such Company Employee to the extent that no waiting period would have applied under the corresponding Old Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time, and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, to the extent that such expenses were recognized for such purposes under the corresponding Old Plan(s).

  (iii)          If directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) business days prior to the Effective Time, effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to terminate, as of the Effective Time, any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code (each a “Company 401(k) Plan”), subject to the consummation of the Merger. No later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company has taken action to terminate each Company 401(k) Plan (effective as of immediately prior to the Closing) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to advance review and approval of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(vi)          The provisions of this Section 5.5(c) are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 5.5(c), express or implied, shall, or shall be construed so as to, confer upon any employee, consultant, manager or other service provider (or any dependent, successor, legal representative or beneficiary thereof), any rights or remedies, including any right to continuance of employment or any other service relationship with Parent or any of its affiliates, or any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.5(c), express or implied, shall, or shall be construed so as to: (A) constitute an amendment or modification or deemed amendment or modification of any Old Plan, New Plan or any other plan providing benefits to any employee or other service provider, (B) interfere with the right of Parent or its affiliates to terminate the employment or other service relationship of any of the Company Employees or other service providers at any time, with or without cause, or restrict any such entity in the exercise of their independent business judgment in modifying any of the terms and conditions of the employment or other service arrangement of the Company Employees or other service providers, or (C) obligate Parent or its affiliates to adopt, enter into or maintain any employee benefit plan or other compensatory plan, program or arrangement at any time.

  (b)          Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director or officer of the Company and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of the Company (each, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before, at or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request of or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such actual or threatened Proceeding, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such actual or threatened Proceeding.   (c)          The Company shall purchase prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If such “tail” prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder. In the event that such a “tail” policy is not obtained, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.   (d)          The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  Section 5.15      Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to provide, upon reasonable request by Parent, such cooperation as is necessary and customary to assist Parent and its affiliates in the preparation and consummation of a potential issuance of equity, unsecured debt securities or unsecured syndicated bank debt, in each case, for the purpose of financing the Merger (the “Financing,” and any banks mandated by Parent or its affiliates for purposes of such Financing, the “Lenders”) including by using reasonable best efforts to: (a) provide to Parent or any of its designated Affiliates and the Lenders as promptly as practicable after their written request therefor all customary historical financial and other information of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be made available for purposes of the arrangement or consummation of the Financing; (b) if requested by Parent in writing, assist Parent or any of its designated Affiliates in the preparation of customary prospectuses and/or offering documents, private placement memoranda and similar marketing documents and ratings agency presentation materials (together the “Marketing Documents”) required in connection with the consummation of the Financing; and (c) if requested by Parent in writing, cooperate with the advisors retained by Parent or its Affiliates for the purpose of producing customary pro forma financial information on the Company and its Subsidiaries under applicable accounting standards and procedures for purposes of inclusion in the Marketing Documents, if required in connection with the consummation of the Financing; provided, in each case, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary provided herein, nothing in this Section 5.15 shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) execute prior to the Closing any definitive financing documents, including any credit or other agreements, pledge or security documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents in connection with the Financing, (ii) take any action that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to Closing set forth in this Agreement to fail to be satisfied, (iii) take any action that would reasonably be expected to cause any violation, breach or default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) of this Agreement or any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (iv) take any action that would conflict with the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws, (v) take any action that would cause any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (vi) provide access to or disclose information in a way that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (vii) take any corporate actions prior to the Closing to permit the consummation of, or otherwise in connection with, the Financing, (viii) prepare any financial statements or information that are not available to the Company and prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice, (ix) pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time, or (x) take any action to the extent it would unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ respective businesses.

Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all out-of- pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and ratings agencies’ fees) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation described in this Section 5.15. The Company hereby releases Parent from any restrictions under the Confidentiality Agreement regarding contact with potential Lenders and hereby agrees that potential Lenders are “Representatives” of Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates be permitted to disclose to any potential Lender or any other person any information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such disclosure would, if disclosed by the Company (i) violate any Law or the rules of any stock exchange absent a public disclosure by the Company or (ii) violate any Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b), as it applies to the Company’s obligations under this Section 5.15, shall be deemed satisfied unless the Company has willfully breached its obligations under this Section 5.15, and such willful breach has been the principal cause of the Financing not being obtained by the End Date.

  Section 5.16     Pre-Closing Reorganization. The Company agrees that upon written request by Parent, the Company shall consider in good faith (a) cooperating with Parent to determine the nature of, and (b) implementing or having its wholly-owned Subsidiaries implement, in each case, such corporate reorganizations of the Company’s Subsidiaries’ corporate structure as Parent may reasonably request in writing at least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing to provide for the optimal structure of the Company’s Subsidiaries at the Closing; provided that, if the Company provides such cooperation or implementation, it shall be at Parent’s sole cost and expense and subject to applicable Laws (the “Pre-Closing Reorganization”). For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to cooperate with or participate in or to effect (and will not be required to cause any of its Subsidiaries to cooperate, participate in or to effect) any Pre-Closing Reorganization or take any other action pursuant to this Section 5.16 if the Company determines in good faith that such Pre-Closing Reorganization (i) could not be unwound in the event the Merger is not consummated without adversely affecting or being prejudicial to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) would result in any contravention or breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of their respective organizational documents, any Contract or any Law or Permit, (iii) would be effected earlier than the day before the Closing Date, (iv) would change the form or reduce the amount of the Merger Consideration or change the Tax consequences to the Company’s stockholders, (v) would require the Company to obtain the prior approval of the Company’s stockholders, (vi) would prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the parties set forth in Article VI, including any approval required from a Governmental Entity or any other person, or (vii) would otherwise have a more than de minimis adverse effect on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the event the Closing does not occur (taking into account the indemnity provided by Parent pursuant to the final sentence of this Section 5.16). Parent must provide written notice to the Company of any proposed Pre-Closing Reorganization as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, at least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub each hereby waives any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company where such breach is a result of an action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Pre-Closing Reorganization. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 5.16 unless Parent and Merger Sub have confirmed in writing that all of the conditions to Closing have been satisfied or waived and that they will consummate the Closing on the date of the consummation of the Pre-Closing Restructuring. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries, on an after-Tax basis (determined without taking into account any Tax attributes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), from and against any and all liabilities, losses (including any out-of-pocket costs, fees, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees), Taxes, damages, claims, penalties, interest, awards, and judgments suffered or incurred in connection with or as a result of any completed or proposed Pre-Closing Reorganization and any reversal, unwind, modification or termination thereof.

  Section 8.15     Guarantee.   (a)            Without limiting any obligation or liability of Siemens Parent under the Letter of Support, the Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not as surety, the due and punctual payment and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of all of their obligations, liabilities, covenants and agreements to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The foregoing sentence is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual discharge and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. This is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of collectibility. The obligations of the Guarantor under this Section 8.15 are absolute and unconditional in respect of satisfying the Guaranteed Obligations and shall be enforceable against the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor were the primary obligor (and not merely a surety) under this Agreement. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Company that (a) it is a Delaware corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and it has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into, deliver and perform its obligations under this Section 8.15; (b) the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate actions or proceedings on the part of it are necessary therefor; and (c) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by it and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the other parties hereto, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of it, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except that such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors’ rights generally and to general equitable principles. Until the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantor waives (i) any of the following rights it may have against Parent: subrogation, set-off, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification, and (ii) any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Company against Parent, in the case whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law. For the avoidance of the doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated, the Company shall in no event have the right to receive from the Guarantor any amount that would exceed the amounts that the Company and/or its stockholders are or may be entitled to receive or claim under or in connection with this Agreement.   (b)            The Guarantor hereby waives as to itself promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Guaranteed Obligations incurred, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, and all suretyship defenses (it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall be deemed a waiver by the Guarantor of the obligation of any other party to this Agreement to deliver notice pursuant to the terms of this Agreement). The Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be discharged except by complete performance or payment of the amounts payable under this Agreement, as applicable, and that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in accordance with the terms thereof or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent, Merger Sub or any other person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iv) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to any of the Guaranteed Obligations. If at any time payment under the Agreement is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned by the Company or any of its shareholders or affiliates upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or otherwise, the Guarantor’s obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated upon such restoration or return being made by the Company or its shareholders or affiliates, all as though such payment had not been made. The Guarantor shall be entitled to any and all defenses that Parent and Merger Sub have under this Agreement. The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

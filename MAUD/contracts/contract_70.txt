Each share of Company Common Stock, if any, that is owned by Parent or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Cancelled Shares”) will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. (b) Conversion of Company Common Stock.

(c) Cancellation of Shares. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and all shares of Company Common Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and, subject to Section 3.03, each holder of: (i) a certificate formerly representing any shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”); or (ii) any book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Book-Entry Share”) will, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.02 hereof. (d) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and, after the Effective Time, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub common stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 


Section 3.02 Surrender and Payment. 


(a) Paying Agent; Payment Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) pursuant to an agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as the agent for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration for: (i) the Certificates; and (ii) the Book-Entry Shares. At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificates and the Book- Entry Shares (other than: (A) Cancelled Shares; and (B) Dissenting Shares) (the “Payment Fund”) in amounts and at the times necessary for such payments. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 3.01(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, whose Company Common Stock was converted pursuant to Section 3.01(b) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and which letter of transmittal will be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify and which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) for use in such exchange.   9

(b) Procedures for Surrender; No Interest. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon: (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent; or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and subject to the terms set forth in Section 3.03, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE III, each Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, shall immediately be cancelled. (c) Investment of Payment Fund. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the cash in the Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings, Inc., respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available), or a combination of the foregoing. No losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 3.01(b), Parent and Surviving Corporation shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. (d) Payments to Non-Registered Holders. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that: (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. (e) Full Satisfaction. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock   10

formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ARTICLE III. (f) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation (or, at the option of Parent, Parent), upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration without any interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock on the date the amounts would escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation (or, at the option of Parent, Parent) free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (g) Dissenting Shares Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 


Section 3.03 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 3.01, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled in accordance with Section 3.01(a)) and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws, or loses such holder’s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws, or loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(b), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-Entry Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any waiver or withdrawal of any such demand, and any other demand, notice, or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands prior to the Effective Time.   11

Section 3.04 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this Agreement, including pursuant to Equity Awards disclosed on Section 4.02(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter or as permitted pursuant to this Agreement to be issued subsequent to the date hereof), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration (as applicable) and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that this sentence shall not be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 


Section 3.05 Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration, as the case may be, otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. All compensatory amounts subject to payroll reporting and withholding payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be payable through the applicable employer entity’s payroll system as promptly as reasonably practicable after such amount has become due and payable hereunder. 


Section 3.06 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this ARTICLE III.

All fees and expenses in respect of the Financing that are required to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the date of this Agreement have been paid in full. (c) The execution and delivery of the Debt Commitment Letter have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action of the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub, and to the Knowledge of the Parent, the Financing Sources.   42

(e) Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Guarantor’s or its Affiliates ability to obtain the Financing or any other financing is not a condition to any of its obligations under this Agreement or a condition precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(B) in response to a Company Intervening Event, may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event if the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to conflict with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided, that prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) the Company shall have given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action, including specifying the Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (ii) during such four (4) Business Day period following the date on which such notice is received, the Company shall and shall cause its Representatives to, if requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as Parent may propose, (iii) upon the end of such notice period the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and capable of being accepted by the Company, and shall have determined, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Company Intervening Event still would reasonably be expected to conflict with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (iv) in the event of any material   53

(c) Parent Specific Performance Remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to specific performance of (or other injunctive relief to enforce) the Company’s obligation to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and effect the Offer Closing if, and only if (i) the Company fails to consummate the Offer, the Merger and/or the other transactions contemplated hereby at the time such consummation is obligated hereunder, (ii) Parent has delivered to the Company a certificate irrevocably certifying that as of the date on which the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby should have occurred all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or have been irrevocably waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), (iii) Parent has confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted, then it would take such actions that are required of it (and cause the Merger Sub to take such actions) by this Agreement to cause the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and the Offer Closing to occur, and (iv) Company fails to consummate the Offer Closing by the earlier of (y) 9:00 am on the Outside Date, or (z) the date that is three (3) Business Days after the date of delivery of the confirmation described in clause (iii) (the “Parent Specific Performance Conditions”).   89

Section 9.14 Recourse Only to Parties. (a) Parent Affiliates.

No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement, including any director, officer, stockholder, member, partner, attorney, accountant, agent, employee, representative or Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement (“Non-Party Affiliates”), will have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, at law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any liabilities or obligations arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation or execution; and each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, obligations and claims against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third party beneficiaries of this Section 9.14. (b) Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders shall (A) have any rights (including any right of specific performance or any right to enforce any right of Parent or Merger Sub under the Debt Commitment Letter) or claims against any Financing Source in any way relating to the Financing, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, whether in law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, or (B) commence, continue or assist any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,   90

petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any Financing Source in any way relating to the Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, whether in law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (ii) no Financing Source shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Nothing in this Section will limit the rights of Parent in respect of the Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter or any other agreements related thereto and nothing in this Section will limit the Company from seeking specific performance of the Parent’s obligation to enforce the Debt Commitment Letter and/or Definitive Financing Agreements for the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, no Financing Source shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders. 


Section 9.15 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which will be one and the same agreement. This Agreement will become effective when each party to this Agreement will have received counterparts signed by all of the other parties. 


Section 9.16 Disclosure Schedules; Materiality. The disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter, whether or not an explicit cross reference appears therein, shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The mere inclusion of an item (including dollar amounts) in the Company Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item is required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item is material or outside the ordinary course of business or constitutes a Company Material Adverse Effect, would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or that the inclusion of such item in the Company Disclosure Letter is required). Without limiting the foregoing, the term “material” as used in the representations and warranties of the Company herein and the disclosure of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter is not a representation or admission by the Company that a particular representation or matter disclosed is, was or may be material for purposes of the Exchange Act. 


Section 9.17 Guarantee.

The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligations in the event that Parent becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of any such party to so file shall not affect Guarantor’s obligations hereunder. So long as this guarantee is in effect, Guarantor shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of its performance of its guarantee, whether by subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, contribution or otherwise, against Parent or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor, provided, however, that Guarantor may file a claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligations in the event that Parent becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, whether such claim arises by right of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, contribution or otherwise. 


(b) Guarantor hereby represents to the Company as follows: (i) as to the matters in Section 5.04. (ii) that the Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. (iii) that Guarantor has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions to which it is a party contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Guarantor and the fulfillment by Guarantor of its obligations under this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Guarantor and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Guarantor are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to fulfill such obligations. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Guarantor and, assuming due execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. (iv) that the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by Guarantor and the fulfillment by Guarantor of its obligations contemplated by this Agreement do not and will not: (i) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Guarantor; (ii) conflict with or violate any Law applicable Guarantor or any of its properties or assets; (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, result in Guarantor’s loss of any benefit or the imposition of any additional payment or other liability under, or alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to any third party any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, or cancellation, or require any Consent under, any Contract to which Guarantor is a party or otherwise bound as of the date hereof; or (iv) result in the creation of a Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the   92

ARTICLE I 


MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS Section 1. Place of Meetings. All meetings of the stockholders may be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, or if not so designated, at the registered office of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “General Corporation Law”). If so authorized, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder, (ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation. 


Section 2. Annual Meeting. Unless Directors are elected by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting as permitted by law and these Amended and Restated By-Laws (these “By-Laws”), an annual meeting of stockholders may be held at such date and time, and by such means of remote communication, if any, as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, at which meeting the stockholders shall elect a board of directors and shall transact such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting. If no annual meeting is held in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Board of Directors shall cause the meeting to be held as soon thereafter as convenient, which meeting shall be designated a special meeting in lieu of annual meeting. The Corporation may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of stockholders.








________________


Section 3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, be called by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer and shall be called by the Chief Executive Officer or Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders holding a majority of voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in an election of directors. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting. The Corporation may postpone, reschedule or cancel any special meeting of stockholders. 


Section 4. Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, annual or special, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. 


Section 5. Voting List. The Corporation shall prepare at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) at the Corporation’s principal place of business. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 


Section 6. Quorum. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by remote communication, or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, one-third of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or by remote communication, or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. If no quorum shall be present or represented at any meeting of stockholders, such meeting may be adjourned in accordance with Section 7 hereof, until a quorum shall be present or represented.   - 2 -








________________


Section 7. Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned from time to time to any other time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may be held under these By-Laws, which time and place shall be announced at the meeting, by a majority of the stockholders present in person or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote (whether or not a quorum is present), or by any officer entitled to preside at or to act as Secretary of such meeting, without notice other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting, provided that a quorum either was present at the original meeting or is present at the adjourned meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 


Section 8. Action at Meetings. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock present in person or by remote communication, or represented by proxy, entitled to vote and voting on the matter (or where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, the affirmative vote of the majority of voting power of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting) shall decide any matter (other than the election of Directors) brought before such meeting, unless the matter is one upon which by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter. The shares of stock of holders who abstain from voting on any matter shall be deemed not to have been voted on such matter. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or by remote communication, or represented by proxy at the meeting, entitled to vote and voting on the election of Directors. 


Section 9. Voting and Proxies. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock having voting power upon the matter in question held of record by such stockholder. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders, or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. 


Section 10. Action Without Meeting. Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. An electronic   - 3 -

transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written and signed for the purposes herein, provided that any such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (A) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (B) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all such purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. 


ARTICLE II 


DIRECTORS 


Section 1. Number, Election, Tenure and Qualification. The number of Directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be not less than one. Within such limit, the number of Directors shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the stockholders at the annual meeting or at any special meeting of stockholders. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting or at any special meeting of stockholders, or by written consent in lieu of an annual or special meeting of the stockholders (provided, however, that if such consent is less than unanimous, such action by written consent may be in lieu of holding an annual meeting only if all of the directorships to which directors could be elected at an annual meeting held at the effective time of such action are vacant and are filled by such action), except as provided in section 3 of this Article II, and each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified, unless sooner displaced. Directors need not be stockholders. 


Section 2. Vacancies. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created Directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of Directors may be filled by a majority of the Directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the Directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, subject to such Director’s earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. If there are no Directors in office, then an election of Directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors, except as otherwise provided by law or these By-Laws, may exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled. 


Section 3. Resignation and Removal. Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the Corporation at its principal place of business or to the Chief Executive Officer or Secretary. Such resignation shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some other time or upon the happening of some other event. Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of Directors, unless otherwise specified by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.   - 4 -

INDEMNIFICATION

The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 1, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify any person described in this Section 1 of Article V in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by such person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.   - 10 -

Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 2, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify any person described in this Section 2 in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by such person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding (even though less than a quorum), or (2) if there are no disinterested Directors or if a majority of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

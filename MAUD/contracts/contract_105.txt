(a)              Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock.  Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, US Holdco or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cancelled Shares”) will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 


(b)              Conversion of Company Common Stock.  Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares and Subsidiary-Held Shares) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive:  (i) from Parent, 0.4125 of one Parent Ordinary Share (the “Share Consideration” and such ratio, the “Exchange Ratio”); (ii) from US Holdco and the Surviving Corporation $80.00 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration” and together with the Share Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”); (iii) from Parent, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares payable pursuant to Section 3.01(e); and (iv) from Parent, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder thereof becomes entitled to upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.02(g).

(e)              Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock.  Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock with the same rights, powers, and privileges as the shares so cancelled and converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub common stock, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 


(f)              Fractional Shares.  No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Ordinary Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.01(b) and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Ordinary Shares.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive from Parent a fraction of a Parent Ordinary Share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall in lieu thereof, upon surrender of such holder’s Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, receive in cash from Parent (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of Parent Ordinary Shares on the Nasdaq (as reported by The Wall Street Journal or an authoritative source mutually agreed in good faith by Parent and the Company) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the Effective Time.

Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01(b) in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(e), and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 3.02(g) upon:  (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate; or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares; in each case, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent.  No interest shall be paid or accrued upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or Book- Entry Share.  Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, each Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, shall immediately be cancelled. 


(c)              Investment of Exchange Fund.

To the extent such fund increases for any reason above the level required to make prompt payment of any outstanding Merger Consideration to be paid in exchange for Company Common Stock converted in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.01(b), Parent, US Holdco and the Surviving Corporation shall, following such prompt payment, be the sole owners of any amounts left over in such Exchange Fund.  Parent shall be treated for Tax purposes as the owner of any Parent Ordinary Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares held in the Exchange Fund, and Parent shall be subject to Tax on all interest and other income resulting from the investment of such cash.  US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be treated for Tax purposes as the owner of any cash held in the Exchange Fund prior to its disbursement, and shall be subject to Tax on all interest and other income resulting from investments of such cash. 


(d)              Payments to Non-Registered Holders.  If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that:  (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred; and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration without any interest.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws.

No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Ordinary Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Company Common Stock until the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 3.06) or Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.02.  Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the whole Parent Ordinary Shares issued in exchange for Company Common Stock in accordance with this Section 3.02, without interest:  (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole Parent Ordinary Shares and not paid; and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole Parent Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 3.01, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws, or loses such holder’s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, waives, withdraws, or loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(b), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-Entry Share, as the case may be.  The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any waiver or withdrawal of any such demand, and any other demand, notice, or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time that relates to such demand, and Parent and US Holdco shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.  Except with the prior written consent of Parent and US Holdco, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands. 


Section 3.04          Adjustments.  Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or the Parent Ordinary Shares shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent as permitted by this Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Exchange Ratio and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that this sentence shall not be construed to permit Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 


Section 3.05          Withholding Rights.  Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any Tax Laws.  Amounts so deducted and withheld (and, in the case of the Exchange Agent, Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate, paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 


Section 3.06          Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Parent or US Holdco, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or US Holdco may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this Article III.

Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall, as of the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and be converted into a Parent Share Option, subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting conditions, applicable to such Company Stock Option, to purchase the number of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Equity Conversion Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares, at an exercise price per Parent Ordinary Share equal to (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, divided by (y) the Parent Equity Conversion Ratio, rounding up to the nearest whole cent; provided that the exercise price, the number of Parent Ordinary Shares and the terms and conditions of such Parent Share Option shall be determined consistent with the applicable requirements for exempt, nonstatutory stock options under Section 409A of the Code. 


(b)              Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units. 


(i)      Each award of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Restricted Stock, to be provided to such holder promptly but no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time. 


(ii)      Each award of Company Restricted Stock Units that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and be converted into a number of Parent Restricted Share Units, subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting conditions, applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Units, equal to (i) the number of such Company Restricted Stock Units, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Equity Conversion Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole number of Parent Restricted Share Units. 


(c)              Company Stock Purchase Plan.  As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company, the Company Board or, as appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the Company Stock Purchase Plan:  (i) the final exercise date shall be the Closing Date, (ii) each participant’s accumulated contributions under the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan as of such date (provided that participants shall not be permitted to increase their payroll deductions in effect as of the date hereof), and (iii) unless otherwise requested by Parent and US Holdco the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate on such date and no further rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company Stock Purchase Plan.  All shares of Company Common Stock purchased in accordance with this Section 3.07(c) shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 


(d)              Assumption of Company Stock Plans. At the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of applicable Law, Parent shall assume all rights and obligations in respect of each Company Stock Plan, including each outstanding Company Equity Award to be converted in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.07 except that:  (i) stock covered by such awards shall be Parent Ordinary Shares; (ii) all references in such Company Stock Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be amended or deemed amended to refer instead to a number of Parent Ordinary Shares determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Parent Equity Conversion Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole number of Parent Ordinary Shares; and (iii) the Parent Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Stock Plan.  Parent shall take all actions that are necessary for the assumption of the Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Section 3.07, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Ordinary Shares as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.07.  If registration of the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable thereunder is required under the Securities Act, Parent shall file with the SEC on the Closing Date a registration statement with respect to such Parent Ordinary Shares, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the relevant Company Stock Plans remain in effect and such registration of Parent Ordinary Shares continues to be required.

None of the Company SEC Documents, including any financial statements, schedules, or exhibits included or incorporated by reference therein at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

The Company maintains a system of “internal controls over financial reporting” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including policies and procedures that:  (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of the Company’s management and the Company Board; and (iii) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the assets of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries.  The Company’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and that assessment concluded that those controls were effective and disclosed to the Company’s independent public accounting firm and audit committee of the Company Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Since January 1, 2019, neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has identified or been made aware of:  (i) any “significant deficiency” or “material weakness” (each as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) in the system of internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries that has not been subsequently remediated; or (ii) any fraud that involves the Company’s management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.04          SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance; Undisclosed Liabilities; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. 


(a)              SEC Filings.  Parent has timely filed with or furnished to, as applicable, the SEC all registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements, and other documents (including exhibits and schedules thereto and all other information incorporated by reference) required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since January 1, 2019, (the “Parent SEC Documents”).  True, correct, and complete copies of all Parent SEC Documents are publicly available on EDGAR.  To the extent that any Parent SEC Document available on EDGAR contains redactions pursuant to a request for confidential treatment or otherwise, Parent has made available to the Company the full text of all such Parent SEC Documents that it has so filed or furnished with the SEC.  As of their respective filing dates or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), each of the Parent SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents.  None of the Parent SEC Documents, including any financial statements, schedules, or exhibits included or incorporated by reference therein at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  To the Knowledge of the Parent, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC investigation and there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents.  None of Parent’s Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish any forms, reports, or other documents with the SEC. 


(b)              Financial Statements.  Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any notes and schedules thereto) contained in or incorporated by reference into the Parent SEC Documents:  (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective dates; (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC for Current Reports on Form 6- K); and (iii) fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position and the results of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial statements, subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal and year-end audit adjustments as permitted by GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (but only if the effect of such adjustments would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material).

(c)              Internal Controls.  Parent maintains a system of “internal controls over financial reporting” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including policies and procedures that:  (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of Parent’s management and the Parent Board; and (iii) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the assets of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries.  Parent’s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent’s internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and that assessment concluded that those controls were effective and disclosed to Parent’s independent public accounting firm and audit committee of the Parent Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal control over financial reporting. 


(d)              Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  Parent’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parent’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.  Since January 1, 2019, neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, Parent’s independent registered public accounting firm has identified or been made aware of:  (i) any “significant deficiency” or “material weakness” (each as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) in the system of internal control over financial reporting utilized by Parent and its Subsidiaries that has not been subsequently remediated; or (ii) any fraud that involves Parent’s management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal control over financial reporting utilized by Parent and its Subsidiaries. 


(e)              Undisclosed Liabilities.  The audited balance sheet of Parent dated as of December 31, 2019, contained in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof is hereinafter referred to as the “Parent Balance Sheet.”  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities that are required by GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent other than Liabilities that:  (i) are reflected or reserved against in the Parent Balance Sheet (including in the notes thereto); (ii) were incurred since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business, including any Parent COVID Actions; (iii) are incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iv) would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 


(f)              Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to any “off- balance sheet arrangements” (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act). 


(g)              Sarbanes-Oxley and Nasdaq Compliance.  Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive officer and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all material respects.  For purposes of this Agreement, “principal executive officer” and “principal financial officer” shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Parent is also in compliance with all of the other applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules of Nasdaq, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b)              Company Superior Proposal.  Notwithstanding Section 6.02(a), prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Company directly or indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to Section 6.02(c):  (i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal that did not arise from a breach of the obligations set forth in Section 6.02(a) in writing that the Company Board believes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal; (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (in all events within twenty-four (24) hours) provided for informational purposes to Parent); provided that such non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries was previously made available to, or is concurrently made available to, Parent; (iii) following receipt of and on account of a Company Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and/or (iv) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take (which order remains unstayed), but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (ii) through (iv), only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law.  Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Company Takeover Proposal, if the Company determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the disclosure of such position is required by applicable Law.

Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.02, the Company Board shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement only if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation that a given Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such actual or potential Company Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (ii) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days (the “Company Superior Proposal Notice Period”) before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Company Superior Proposal or entering into (or causing one of its Subsidiaries to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to declare a Company Superior Proposal and that it intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement in connection with such Company Superior Proposal (it being understood that the delivery and receipt of any such notice shall not, in and of itself, be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), (iii) the Company specifies the identity of the party making the Company Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof in such notice and includes an unredacted copy of the Company Takeover Proposal and attaches to such notice the most current version of any proposed agreement (which version shall be updated on a prompt basis) and any related documents, including financing documents, to the extent provided by the relevant party in connection with, and containing material terms of, the Company Superior Proposal, (iv) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Company Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being understood and agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Company Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price or financing, the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remains in the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)), and (v) at the conclusion of the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Company Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this Agreement or otherwise and that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 


(e)              Company Intervening Event.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, upon the occurrence of a Company Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 


(i)      the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation that a Company Intervening Event has occurred and that failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Company Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

(ii)      the Company (A) promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days (the “Company Intervening Event Notice Period”) before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Company Intervening Event of its intention to take such action, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the Company Intervening Event (it being understood that the delivery and receipt of any such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) and (B) prior to making such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, to the extent requested in writing by Parent, engages in good faith negotiations with Parent during such three (3) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the failure of the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Company Intervening Event would no longer be, in the good faith determination of the Company Board in consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation, inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood that, if after commencement of the Company Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material change to the circumstances giving rise to the Company Intervening Event that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder, a new notice to Parent shall be required as provided above; provided, that with respect to each such material change, each reference in this clause (ii) to a “three (3) Business Day” period shall be changed to refer to a “two (2) Business day” period); and 


(iii)      at the conclusion of the Company Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation, that in light of such Company Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 


Section 6.03          Company Stockholders Meeting.  The Company shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 is declared effective, and, in connection therewith, the Company shall mail the Company Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock in advance of such meeting.  Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 6.02 hereof, the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation.  Subject to Section 6.02 hereof, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to:  (a) solicit from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger; and (b) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to obtain such approval.  The Company shall keep Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as requested by Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub.  Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent and US Holdco (other than: (i) in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders; or (ii) as reasonably determined by the Company to comply with applicable Law).  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on the same day and at the same time as the Parent Shareholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting.  Without the prior written consent of Parent and US Holdco or as required by applicable Law, (i) the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than a non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger and matters of procedure) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company shall not submit any other proposal to such stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise (including any proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii) the Company shall not call any meeting of the stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.  If the Company Board makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it will not alter the obligation of the Company to submit the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger to the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting to consider and vote upon, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

The foregoing notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 6.04 that:  (1) would require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any Persons who are officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to:  (A) pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing or any Take-Out Financing, (B) enter into, execute, or deliver any certificate, document, instrument, or agreement, or (C) agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument, or agreement; in each case, that would be effective prior to the Closing Date (it being agreed that no officers or directors shall be required to take any of the foregoing actions in clauses (A), (B) and (C) to the extent they are not continuing, or expected to continue, as an officer or director following the Closing); provided that none of the foregoing shall apply to any (x) letters and authorizations required in order to obtain comfort letters and auditor consents as described in Section 6.04(a)(ii) and (y) the authorization letters described in Section 6.04(a)(v); (2) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (3) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability, or obligation with respect to the Debt Financing or any Take-Out Financing prior to the Closing or have any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any agreement, certificate, document, or instrument with respect to the Debt Financing or any Take-Out Financing be effective prior to the Closing that would not be reimbursed or indemnified under Section 6.04(b), (4) cause any director, officer, employee, or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (5) conflict with the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws, (6) reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (7) provide access to or disclose information that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (8) would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 7.02          Parent No Solicitation. 


(a)              Solely prior to receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, during the Interim Period Parent shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, employees and directors not to, and shall and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the other Representatives of Parent not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, propose, induce or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Parent Takeover Proposal or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Parent Takeover Proposal; (ii) enter into, continue, conduct, engage or otherwise participate in in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information relating to Parent or its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of Parent or its Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist, knowingly facilitate, or knowingly encourage the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Parent Takeover Proposal; (iii) amend or grant any waiver or release under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of Parent or its Subsidiaries; (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other Contract relating to any Parent Takeover Proposal (each, a “Parent Acquisition Agreement”); (v) submit any Parent Takeover Proposal to the vote of the stockholders of Parent; or (vi) approve, authorize, agree or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing; provided, that notwithstanding that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent or any of its Representatives may, in response to an inquiry or proposal from a Third Party, inform such Third Party of the restrictions imposed by the provisions of this Section 7.02.  Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, employees and directors not to, and shall and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the other Representatives of Parent not to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions, or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Parent Takeover Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of Parent and its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information and immediately terminate access by any Third Party to any physical or electronic data room relating to any potential Parent Takeover Proposal.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any breach of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.02(a) by any Representative of Parent (solely for this purpose as if the restrictions on Parent set forth in this Section 7.02(a) applied directly to such Representatives) shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 7.02(a) by Parent. 


(b)              Notification to the Company.  Without limiting Section 7.02(a): (i) from and after the date hereof, Parent shall notify the Company promptly (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days) after the receipt by Parent (or any of its Representatives) of any Parent Takeover Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Takeover Proposal, any request for non-public information relating to Parent or its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of Parent or its Subsidiaries by any Third Party.  In such notice, Parent shall identify the Third Party making, and details of the material terms and conditions of, any such Parent Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any proposed financing and (ii) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and material terms of any such Parent Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price, proposed financing, and other material terms thereof. 


(c)              Compliance with Irish Takeover Code.  Section 7.02(a) and Section 7.02(b) shall not prevent Parent from making any disclosure to the Irish Takeover Panel or to its shareholders consistent with the provisions of Section 7.02(a) and Section 7.02(b) if the Parent Board has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with Parent’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the Parent Board under applicable Law; provided that if any such disclosure to Parent’s shareholders is anything other than a rejection of the applicable Parent Takeover Proposal or a reaffirmation of the Parent Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. 


(d)              Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.  Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.02, the Parent Board shall not effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change prior to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote.

(e)              Parent Intervening Event.  At any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, upon the occurrence of a Parent Intervening Event, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 


(i)      the Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation that a Parent Intervening Event has occurred and that failure to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Parent Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the shareholders of Parent under applicable Law; 


(ii)      Parent (A) promptly notifies the Company, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days (the “Parent Intervening Event Notice Period”) before making a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Parent Intervening Event of its intention to take such action, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the Parent Intervening Event (it being understood that the delivery and receipt of any such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) and (B) prior to making such a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, to the extent requested in writing by the Company, engages in good faith negotiations with the Company during such three (3) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the failure of the Parent Board to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Parent Intervening Event would no longer be, in the good faith determination of the Parent Board in consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation, inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood that, if after commencement of the Parent Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material change to the circumstances giving rise to the Parent Intervening Event that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder, a new notice to Parent shall be required as provided above; provided, that with respect to each such material change, each reference in this clause (ii) to a “three (3) Business Day” period shall be changed to refer to a “two (2) Business Day” period); and 


(iii)      at the conclusion of the Parent Intervening Event Notice Period, the Parent Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of national reputation, that in light of such Parent Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by the Company, the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Parent directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

Section 7.03          Parent Shareholders Meeting; Approval by Sole Stockholders of Merger Sub. 


(a)              Parent Shareholders Meeting.  Parent shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 is declared effective, and, in connection therewith, Parent shall mail the ​EGM Notice to the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares in advance of the Parent Shareholders Meeting.  Except to the extent that the Parent Board shall have effected a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 7.02 hereof, the EGM Notice shall include the Parent Board Recommendation.  Subject to Section 7.02 hereof, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to:  (i) solicit from the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares proxies in favor of the approval of granting the Parent Board authority to effect the Parent Share Issuance; and (ii) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares required by applicable Law to obtain such approval.  Parent shall keep the Company updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as requested by the Company.  Once the Parent Shareholders Meeting has been called and noticed, Parent shall not postpone or adjourn the Parent Shareholders Meeting without the consent of Company (other than:  (A) in order to obtain a quorum of its shareholders; or (B) as reasonably determined by Parent to comply with applicable Law).  Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Company to hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting on the same day and at the same time as the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting.  Without the prior written consent of the Company or as required by applicable Law, (i) the approval of the grant of authority to the Parent Board to effect the Parent Share Issuance shall be the only matter that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholders Meeting and, prior to receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, Parent shall not submit any other proposal to such shareholders in connection with the Parent Shareholders Meeting (including any proposal inconsistent with the approval of the grant of authority to the Parent Board to effect the Parent Share Issuance or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except for, following the approval of the grant of authority, any Parent AGM Resolutions proposed to be voted on at a Parent AGM to be called and held on a date subsequent to the Parent Shareholder Meeting (provided that it is acknowledged and agreed that the Parent AGM must be held no later than September 30, 2021, and Parent shall be permitted to take action to call and hold the Parent AGM on such date even if the Requisite Parent Vote has not been obtained) and (ii) prior to receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, Parent shall not call any meeting of the shareholders of Parent other than the Parent Shareholders Meeting.  If the Parent Board makes a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, it will not alter the obligation of Parent to submit the approval of the grant of authority to the Parent Board to effect the Parent Share Issuance to the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares at the Parent Shareholders Meeting to consider and vote upon, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Parent Shareholders Meeting. 


(b)              Approval by Sole Stockholders.  Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and US Holdco, as sole stockholders of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL. 


Section 7.04          Benefit Plans. 


(a)              Termination of Benefit Plans.  Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, solely to the extent permitted by Law and the terms of the applicable Company Employee Plan and to the extent that such termination will not trigger a material penalty or result in imposition of additional Tax, other than as a result of the acceleration of recognition of income or deferral of deduction from income, to the Company and its Subsidiaries or any Company Employee, the Company shall terminate any Company Employee Plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries that Parent has requested to be terminated by providing a written notice to the Company at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and, no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plans have been terminated. 


(b)              Prior Written Consent.  With respect to matters described in this Section 7.04, the Company will not send any written notices or other written communication materials to Company Employees without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Section 7.05          Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance. 


(a)              Indemnification.  From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Company Stock Plan, in each case, when acting in such capacity (each an “Indemnified Party”) against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director or manager of another Person, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to or at, but not after the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (“Indemnified Liabilities”), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted to do so by law.  Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation within 90 days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are to be advanced provides prior to any receipt of such advances an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL or other applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is determined by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law.  Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Indemnified Party as provided in the Charter Documents of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms; provided that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.  For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of expenses no less favorable than the provisions of the Charter Documents of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions by any Indemnified Party occurring prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal, or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party; provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim made for indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. 


(b)              Insurance.  The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to:  (i) obtain and fully prepay as of the Effective Time “tail” insurance policies from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current insurance carrier with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend, with respect to the entire six (6)-year period following the Effective Time, premiums for such coverage under this Section 7.05 which in the aggregate exceed 300% percent of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the period in its most recent fiscal year for such purpose prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Maximum Premium”).  If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 


(c)              Survival.  The obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.05 shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 7.05 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 7.05 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.05, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 7.05).

(d)              Assumptions by Successors and Assigns; No Release or Waiver.  In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns:  (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.  The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to the Charter Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Law, Contract, or otherwise.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to, or shall release, waive, or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors, and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.05 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. 


(e)              Beneficiaries; Fees.  The provisions of this Section 7.05 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this Section 7.05, and his or her heirs and Representatives.  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 7.05. 


Section 7.06          Financing. 


(a)              No Amendments to Commitment Letter.  Parent will not (without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) consent or agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement, or modification of, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to the Commitment Letter if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, or waiver would:  (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the net proceeds of the Debt Financing to an amount that, together with Parent’s and Merger Sub’s cash on hand and cash equivalents on hand and any Escrowed Take-Out Financing Proceeds, would be less than the Required Amount; (ii) (x) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend, or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or (y) expand, amend or modify any other terms to the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to:  (A) delay or prevent the Closing Date, or (B) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing, materially less likely to occur; or (iii) materially adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing definitive agreements (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the “Restricted Amendments”); provided, that Parent may (without the consent of the Company) amend, replace, supplement, modify, or waive the Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers, or other Debt Financing Sources that have not executed the Commitment Letter and amend titles, allocations, and the fee arrangements with respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers, or Debt Financing Sources, if any such amendment would not reasonably be expected to result in a Restricted Amendment.  Parent or Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any case, within five (5) Business Days) furnish to the Company a copy of any amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, or waiver relating to the Commitment Letter.  For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction of the commitments for the Debt Financing that is automatic pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter shall not constitute a Restricted Amendment.  Any reference in this Agreement to:  (x) the “Debt Financing” will include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as amended or modified, and (y) the “Commitment Letter” will include such document as so amended or modified.  Parent acknowledges and agrees that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of the other obligations under this Agreement that Parent obtain the Debt Financing, the Take-Out Financing or any other financing for or relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)              Taking of Necessary Actions.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the right of Parent to amend, replace, supplement, modify, or waive the Commitment Letter subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.06(a)), Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, and advisable to arrange, maintain the effectiveness of, and consummate the Debt Financing in an amount necessary (after giving effect to Parent’s, US Holdco’s and Merger Sub’s cash on hand, any cash proceeds of any Take-Out Financing received by Parent or its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and any Escrowed Take-Out Financing Proceeds) to fund the Required Amount on or prior to the Closing Date, on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including, but not limited to, using its commercially reasonable efforts to:  (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof and hereof; (ii) negotiate, execute, and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on a timely basis on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date that are within its control and to comply with all of its obligations pursuant to the Commitment Letter; (iv) upon the satisfaction (or waiver) of all of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing; and (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter.  Parent will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Commitment Letter as and when they become due. 


(c)              Information.  To the extent reasonably requested by the Company from time to time, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (including providing the Company, upon request, with copies of all definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing), and such other information and documentation available to Parent as shall be reasonably requested by the Company (including any information requested in connection with any of the circumstances contemplated by the immediately following sentence).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice as soon as reasonably practicable in writing (and in any case, within two (2) Business Days of the occurrence of any of the following):  (i) of any material breach, material default, termination, or cancellation by any party to the Commitment Letter or Debt Financing definitive agreements that Parent becomes aware of, and (ii) of the receipt by Parent of any written notice from any Debt Financing Source with respect to:  (A) any breach, default, termination, or cancellation by any party to the Commitment Letter or Debt Financing definitive agreements; or (B) any material dispute or material disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter or Debt Financing definitive agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing. 


(d)              Alternative Financing.  In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent will promptly notify the Company in writing and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, arrange and obtain financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to replace any unavailable portion of the Debt Financing that is required to fund the Required Amount on terms, conditions, and cost not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent; provided, that such commercially reasonable efforts shall not include requiring Parent to pay any additional fees applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of the amount set forth in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (or any related side fee letter) or obtain financing on terms and conditions that are materially less favorable to Parent than those in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter; provided, further, that any such alternative debt financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company have terms or conditions that would result in a Restricted Amendment if such terms or conditions were an amendment to the Commitment Letter or the terms and conditions to the Debt Financing (the “Alternative Financing”).  The provisions of this Section 7.06 shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Debt Financing shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing.

Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.04(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be required to take or agree to (nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be permitted to take or agree unless Parent so directs them (and they shall, if Parent so directs, take or agree to, so long as such agreements are conditioned upon the Closing)) any action, concession or undertaking (i) unless such action, concession or undertaking is conditioned on the Closing or (ii) to the extent it would constitute or result in, or would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Burdensome Condition.  If the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub, on the other hand, receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law and by any applicable Governmental Entity, provide the other party’s counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend and participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing made thereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The parties shall use their best efforts to preserve any applicable privilege to the extent they share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this Section 8.04.

(c)              The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the provisions of this Section 10.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such provisions, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement.  If the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 10.06, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party makes a claim against the non-paying party that results in a judgment, the non-paying party shall pay to the other party the reasonable costs and expenses (including its reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 10.06 at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.  For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made (or caused to be made by a Subsidiary) by the Company, Parent or US Holdco under this Section 10.06 shall be payable only once with respect to this Section 10.06 and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more provision hereof.  Each of the parties to this Agreement further acknowledges that the payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent and US Holdco Expenses by the Company or the Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee or Company Expenses by Parent and/or US Holdco, as applicable, is not a penalty, but, in each case, is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.  The parties to this Agreement agree that the monetary remedies set forth in this Section 10.06 and the specific performance remedies set forth in Section 11.12 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub shall be liable for damages for such fraud or Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for the liability of Parent in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation; and (ii) Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only the Company shall be liable for damages for such fraud or Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company and its  Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, shareholders, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for the liability of the Company in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation. 


(d)              Except as expressly set forth in this Section 10.06, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring such expenses.  If Parent and US Holdco receive the Company Termination Fee, then Parent and US Holdco will not be entitled to also receive a payment of the Parent and US Holdco Expenses; upon payment of any Company Termination Fee, any previously paid Parent and US Holdco Expenses shall be credited against the amount of the Company Termination Fee.  In no event shall the Company be entitled to receive more than one payment of the Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee or more than one payment of the Company Expenses.  If the Company receives the Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee, then the Company will not be entitled to also receive a payment of the Company Expenses; upon payment of any Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee, any previously paid Company Expenses shall be credited against the amount of the Parent and US Holdco Termination Fee.

Section 10.07          Amendment.  Subject to Section 11.13, at any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote, by written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto; provided, however, that:  (a) following the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, there shall be no amendment or supplement to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law would require further approval by the holders of Company Common Stock without such approval; and (b) following the receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, there shall be no amendment or supplement to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law would require further approval by the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares without such approval. 


Section 10.08          Extension; Waiver.  At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may:  (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party(ies); (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party(ies) contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under this Agreement; or (c) unless prohibited by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements, or conditions contained in this Agreement.  Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party.  The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 11.09          Severability.  If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.  Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 11.12          Specific Performance. 


(a)              The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached by the parties.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. 


(b)              Each party further agrees that:  (i) no such party will oppose or raise any objection to the granting of an injunction or specific performance as provided herein on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity; (ii) no such party will oppose the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and (iii) no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish, or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 11.12, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

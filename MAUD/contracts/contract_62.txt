Agreement 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I. 


THE OFFER 


1.1 The Offer. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at a price per share equal to the Offer Price. (b) The obligation of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction, or waiver by Purchaser or Parent, of the conditions set forth in Annex A (the “Offer Conditions”). Subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Purchaser or Parent, of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and thereafter pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Expiration Date and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (the time of such acceptance for payment, the “Acceptance Time”). The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller of such Share in cash, without interest, subject to the deduction or withholding of any Taxes as contemplated in Section 2.9, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The time scheduled for payment for shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the “Offer Closing”, and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Offer Closing Date.” (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement. Purchaser and Parent expressly reserve the right to waive (in whole or in part) any Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be   2








________________


granted or withheld in the Company’s sole discretion), Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price (other than in connection with Section 1.1(g) hereof), (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer (other than in connection with Section 1.1(g) hereof), (iv) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares or impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (vi) extend or otherwise change any time period for the performance of any obligation of Purchaser or Parent (including the Expiration Date) in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares other than pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, or (vii) take any action (or fail to take any action) that would result in the Merger not being permitted to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL. (d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (such later date being the “Initial Expiration Date”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at midnight, New York City time, on the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied or, to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms hereof, has not been waived by Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser shall (subject to the rights or remedies of the parties hereto hereunder, including under Article VII), extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the Initial Expiration Date (the Initial Expiration Date as it may be extended herein is referred to as the “Expiration Date”) for one or more periods, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion (or such longer period as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Offer shall not be extended pursuant to this sentence if all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived); provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser (i) be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date or (ii) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date without the prior written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall, without the written consent of the Company, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff, any rule or regulation of the NASDAQ, or any other applicable Law, in each case, applicable to the Offer. (e) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except for a termination of this Agreement permitted in accordance with the terms of Section 7.1. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto, and cause any depositary acting on its behalf to promptly return in accordance with applicable Law all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. (f) On the commencement date of the Offer, Purchaser and Parent shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the “Schedule TO”) that will contain or incorporate by reference   3








________________


the related offer to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the form of the related letter of transmittal, the summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, and together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the “Offer Documents”); and (ii) cause the Schedule TO and related Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares in accordance with applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Purchaser and Parent in writing all information concerning the Company and its stockholders that may be required by applicable Law to be set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(f). The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Purchaser and Parent shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Each of Purchaser, Parent and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser and Parent further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected (if applicable) to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Upon receipt of any written or oral comments by Purchaser, Parent or their counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, Purchaser and Parent agree to (i) promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any such written comments or requests (or a description of any such oral comments or requests); (ii) provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment on any proposed response thereto, and to give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by the Company and its counsel; (iii) provide the Company and its counsel an opportunity to participate with Purchaser, Parent or their counsel in any material discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff; and (iv) provide the Company with copies of any written comments or responses submitted by Purchaser and Parent in response thereto. (g) If, during the period commencing on the Agreement Date and ending at the Offer Closing Date, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 1.1(g) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to the Company Common Stock that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. (h) Subject in all respects to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer Conditions, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. (i) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Merger to be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer.   4

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the “Schedule 14D-9”) that, subject to Section 5.4(d)(i) and Section 5.4(d)(ii), shall contain and reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9 the opinion of the Company Financial Advisor. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents and to the inclusion of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to holders of Shares. Each of Purchaser and Parent shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Purchaser and Parent that may be required by applicable Law to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or reasonably requested in connection with any actions contemplated by this Section 1.2(a). The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC pursuant to this Section 1.2(a) to be disseminated to the Company’s stockholders as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act concurrently with the dissemination of the Schedule TO to the holders of Company Common Stock by Purchaser. Except with respect to any amendments filed in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or after a Change in Company Board Recommendation, the Company agrees to provide Purchaser, Parent and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Purchaser, Parent and their counsel. Each of the Company, Purchaser and Parent agrees, as and to the extent required by applicable Law, to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company’s stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Upon receipt of any written or oral comments or requests for amendments or supplements by the Company or its counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company agrees to (i) promptly provide Purchaser, Parent and their counsel with a copy of any such written comments or requests for amendments or supplements (or a description of any such oral comments); (ii) provide Purchaser, Parent and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment on any proposed response thereto, and to give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by Purchaser, Parent and their counsel prior to responding to any such comments or requests; (iii) provide Purchaser, Parent and their counsel an opportunity to participate with the Company or its counsel in any material discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff; and (iv) provide Purchaser or Parent with copies of any written comments or responses submitted by the Company in response thereto. (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to promptly furnish Purchaser and Parent with (i) mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares; and (ii) security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, and of those persons who become record or beneficial owners subsequent to such date, together with other readily available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Purchaser and Parent with such additional information, including updated listings and computer files of record holders and beneficial holders   5

of Shares, mailing labels, addresses, and security position listings, and such other assistance as Purchaser, Parent or their agents may reasonably require in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.

At the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock, and all holders of book-entry Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock, that were   9








________________


outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in each case, cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Stock Certificate”) is presented to the Payment Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 2.8 or, in the case of Dissenting Shares, treated as set forth in Section 2.10. 2.8 Surrender of Certificates. (a) On or prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the “Payment Agent”). At the Effective Time or as promptly as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Effective Time), Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5. The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as the “Payment Fund.” The Payment Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest or other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the property of Parent. (b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Payment Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than to holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent such holders do not also hold Shares that are not Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Payment Agent for exchange, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer to the Payment Agent as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of such book-entry shares, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal or, in each case, such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or book-entry share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8(b), each Company Stock Certificate or book entry share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.5. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Company   10

Stock Certificate or book-entry share. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. Upon the making of such affidavit and delivering such bond, the Payment Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate as contemplated under this Article II. (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company Stock Certificate or book-entry share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such book-entry share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate or book-entry share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is not applicable. (d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates or book- entry shares as of the date that is one (1) year after the Merger Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates (other than with respect to any Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares in accordance with this Section 2.8 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.8. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of any Company Stock Certificate or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law. 2.9 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, each of the Payment Agent, Purchaser, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price, Merger Consideration or any other payments made in connection with this Agreement, as applicable, payable to any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, any holder of any Company Equity Award or any other recipient pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   11

2.10 Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly made a demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such holder effectively withdraws or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.5, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.5, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares or transfer of such book-entry share, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 2.8. (c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such demand; and (C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment or settlement offer or settle any such demands prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262 of the DGCL to receive payment of the “fair value” for such holder’s shares shall receive such payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation after giving effect to any withholdings or deductions required by applicable Law (but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally determined pursuant to the DGCL). 2.11 Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. The Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable following the consummation of the Offer, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. 2.12 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.   12

2.13 Loan Payoff. Prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall satisfy all notification and consent requirements, as applicable, under the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. No less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall obtain a customary payoff letter from the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement (the “Payoff Letter”) for the Existing Credit Agreement, which Payoff Letter shall provide (a) the amount of unpaid principal, all accrued but unpaid interest and all fees, expenses and other amounts required to be paid under the Existing Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) (collectively with the Existing Credit Agreement, the “Existing Loan Documents”), including any prepayment fees and penalties, in order to repay all amounts due and owing under the Existing Loan Documents as of the Merger Closing (the “Payoff Amount”), (b) that all financial accommodations under the Existing Loan Documents shall be terminated, (c) that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount, all indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under the Existing Loan Documents shall be paid and discharged in full, (d) that guarantees, if any, securing such borrowings or obligations under the Existing Loan Documents shall be, upon the payment of the Payoff Amount on the Merger Closing Date, automatically and irrevocably released and terminated and (e) upon the payment of the Payoff Amount on the Merger Closing Date, that all security interests, pledges and Liens granted pursuant to the Existing Loan Documents shall be irrevocably and automatically released and the Company (or its designee) shall be authorized to prepare and file all appropriate termination filings and other documents to evidence the release of the security interests and termination of the obligations set forth in the Existing Loan Documents.

As of their respective filing dates, and giving effect to any amendments or supplements thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company SEC Reports complied in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the respective rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and none of the Company SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(d) The Company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is reasonably sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are executed in accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that would materially affect the Company’s financial statements.

with the Transactions and (iv) such other consents, approvals, orders, waivers, authorizations, actions, nonactions, registrations, declarations, filings, permits and notices the failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent’s ability to consummate the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 4.4 No Legal Proceedings Challenging the Merger. As of the Agreement Date, (a) there is no Legal Proceeding pending against Purchaser or Parent challenging the Merger; and (b) to the Knowledge of Parent, no Legal Proceeding has been threatened against Purchaser or Parent challenging the Merger. 4.5 Activities of Purchaser.

(b) Without limiting Section 8.8, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by or to Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Purchaser hereunder 4.10 Solvency.

perform all of their obligations under this Agreement, and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Purchaser’s and Parent’s obligations to consummate the Offer, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of and after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Solvent” shall mean that, as of any date of determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the fair value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not engaged in business or a transaction, and are not about to engage in business or a transaction, for which such Person’s and its Subsidiaries’ assets, on a consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably small capital, and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature; provided, however, for the purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5). 4.11 Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of Purchaser or Parent or any of their “affiliates” or “associates” is, or at any time during the last three (3) years has been, an “interested stockholder” of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Prior to the Agreement Date, neither Parent nor Purchaser has taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives of Parent or Purchaser to take, any action that would reasonably be expected to cause, Parent, Purchaser or any of their “affiliates” or “associates” to be deemed an “interested stockholder” as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

foregoing.

The Company shall be responsible for any action taken by its Representatives acting in their authorized capacities on behalf of the Company that would violate this Section 5.4 if taken by the Company. (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in response to (i) an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that is first made after the date of this Agreement and that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; or (ii) an unsolicited inquiry relating to an Acquisition Proposal by a Person that the Company Board determines in good faith is credible and reasonably capable of making a Superior Proposal (an “Inquiry”), the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal: (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry (and such Person’s Representatives); provided, however, that the Company and such Person enter into a customary confidentiality agreement that is on terms no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (but that need not contain “standstill” or similar restrictions); and provided further, that any material non-public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided or made available to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall, to the extent not previously provided to Purchaser or Parent, be provided or made available to Purchaser or Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable after it is provided to such Person making such Acquisition Proposal; and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that prohibits or purports to prohibit an Acquisition Proposal being made to the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, provided that the Company has complied with Section 5.4(a), the Company and its Representatives may (x) following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, contact the Person making such Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal made by such Person or (y) direct any such Person to this Agreement, including the specific provisions of Section 5.4(a). (c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and shall indicate the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry (unless prohibited by the terms of a confidentiality or other similar agreement in effect as of the date hereof) and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer or the nature of any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of all material developments affecting the status of and any material changes to the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry.   39

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, take any of the actions set forth in Sections 5.4(d)(i)-(iii) below (provided, however, that prior to taking any such action, the Company complies with Section 5.4(e) of this Agreement): (i) if there is an Intervening Event, effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of the Company’s obligations under this Section 5.4 if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) (and, if applicable, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement), if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to enter into such definitive agreement would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.4(d), the Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.4(d)(i) or Section 5.4(d)(ii); or (ii) terminate this Agreement (and, if applicable, enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement) pursuant to Section 5.4(d)(iii), unless: (A) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to (I) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a “Recommendation Change Notice”), or (II) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) in response to a Superior Proposal (a “Superior Proposal Notice”), which notice shall, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is not related to a Superior Proposal, contain a description of the Intervening Event giving rise to such proposed action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal unless prohibited by the terms of a confidentiality or other similar agreement in effect as of the date   40

hereof) and a copy of the Company Acquisition Agreement in the form to be entered into (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation); (B) during the three (3) Business Day period commencing on the date of Parent’s receipt of such notice, the Company shall have made its Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or the Offer or a possible alternative transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal, and (C) (1) in the case of a Recommendation Change Notice, Parent does not make, within three (3) Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel), cause the Intervening Event to no longer form the basis for the Company Board to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation and (2) in the case of a Superior Proposal Notice, after the expiration of the negotiation period described in clause (B) above, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer that Parent and Purchaser have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (B) above, that (X) after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (Y) after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation and/or enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any material changes with respect to the Intervening Event mentioned above, or material changes to the financial terms of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior to the Company’s effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and a new three (3) Business Day period. (f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders of factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal if, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that this Section 5.4(f) shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the Company Board and the rights of Purchaser and Parent under Section 5.4(d) and Section 5.4(e) of this Agreement, to the extent applicable to such disclosure (it being understood that neither any “stop, look and listen” letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, nor any accurate disclosure of such factual information (other than the Company or the Company Board taking any action set forth in Section 5.4(d) and Section 5.4(e) of this Agreement) to the Company’s stockholders that is required to be made to such stockholders under applicable Law or in satisfaction of the Company Board’s fiduciary duties or applicable Law, shall in and of itself be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation).   41

For the avoidance of doubt, service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to, any (i) accruals under any Parent defined benefit pension plan in which any Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time; or (ii) Parent retiree medical program in which any Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this Section 5.11(d) result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

Prior to the Acceptance Time, the compensation committee of the Company Board (the “Compensation Committee”) will cause each Company Employee Benefit Plan and Company employment agreement pursuant to which consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is a holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation Committee (comprised solely of “independent directors”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto as an “employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement” within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.   47

In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect; provided, however, that (i) the last sentence of Section 1.2(b), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII (and the Confidentiality Agreement) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from any liabilities or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by such party or such party’s equity holders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including the aggregate amount of the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration, consideration in respect of Company Equity Awards, other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed to be damages of such party) arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith or any Fraud, subject only, with respect to any such liabilities of the Company, to Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that any failure of Parent or Purchaser to satisfy its obligation to accept for payment or pay for Company Common Stock or the Company Equity Awards following satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, and any failure of Parent to cause the Merger to be effected following satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 6, will be deemed to constitute a willful and material breach of a covenant of this Agreement. The parties’ rights and remedies under the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “willful and material   50

breach” shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken, or a failure to act, which the breaching party knew, or reasonably should have known, would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material breach of this Agreement. Nothing shall limit or prevent any party from exercising any rights or remedies it may have under Section 8.7 in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1. 7.3 Termination Fees. (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee. The Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall be paid no later than the second (2nd) Business Day following termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and concurrently with any termination pursuant to Section 7.1(h). (b) If (i) after the date of this Agreement but prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, an Acquisition Proposal shall have become publicly known or delivered to the Company Board and not publicly withdrawn (if it became publicly known), (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) where the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur prior to the Outside Date is attributable to the failure of the Minimum Condition to have been satisfied, or (B) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(e) for willful and material breach which willful and material breach is the principal factor in the failure of the Offer to be consummated (unless the Company Termination Fee provided in Section 7.3(a) has already been paid pursuant to the terms thereof), and (iii) within nine (9) months after such termination the Company consummates an Acquisition Transaction or enters into an agreement for an Acquisition Transaction which Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date such transaction is consummated; provided that solely for purposes of this Section 7.3(b), all references to 20% in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” shall be deemed to be references to 50%. (c) All payments under this Section 7.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party to whom payment is owed. (d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Termination Fee shall be payable only once and not in duplication even though the Company Termination Fee may be payable under one or more provisions hereof. In the event Parent shall receive the Company Termination Fee, the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination thereof or any matter forming the basis for such termination), and none of Parent, Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination; provided, however that   51

payment of the Company Termination Fee will not be liquidated damages in the case of Fraud or a willful and material breach of this Agreement. If the Company fails promptly to pay the Company Termination Fee when due and payable pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences an action or other proceeding that results in an award against the Company for such Company Termination Fee, the Company shall pay Parent’s costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such action or proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

8.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement and all actions (whether at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. All actions and proceedings (whether at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such court (and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court therefrom), in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties agree that service of any court paper may be made in any manner as may be provided under the applicable Laws or court rules governing service of process in such court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. 8.6 Intentionally Omitted. 8.7 Specific Enforcement. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described herein. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Purchaser, on the other hand, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement. If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and Purchaser to consummate the Offer or the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent and Purchaser, and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach on behalf of its stockholders.   53

8.8 Obligation of Parent. Parent shall cause Purchaser to comply in all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, and the other Transactions. As a material inducement to the Company’s willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by Purchaser of each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by Purchaser under this Agreement and the Transactions, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Purchaser shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Purchaser in the first instance. References in this Section 8.8 to “Purchaser” shall also include the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time. 8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Purchaser may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of the Company; provided no assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 8.10 Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly delivered: (a) four (4) Business Days after being sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; (b) one (1) Business Day after being sent for next Business Day delivery, fees prepaid, via a reputable nationwide overnight courier service; (c) on the date of confirmation of receipt (or the first (1st) Business Day following such receipt if the date of such receipt is not a Business Day) of transmission by facsimile, in each case to the intended recipient as set forth below (or to such other address or facsimile telephone number as such party shall have specified in a written notice given to the other parties hereto); (d) if sent by email transmission prior to 6:00 p.m. recipient’s local time, upon transmission when receipt is confirmed, or (e) if sent by email transmission after 6:00 p.m. recipient’s local time and receipt is confirmed, the business day following the date of transmission:   54

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Purchaser to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer)), to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Date in connection with the Offer if, immediately prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Date: 


(a) (i) any waiting period under the HSR Act (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger shall not have expired or been terminated, (ii) any applicable waiting periods under any other applicable Antitrust Laws shall not have expired or been terminated and any applicable consents or approvals required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws shall not have been obtained; 


(b) there shall not have been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer (and “received” as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL), and not validly withdrawn, that number of Shares that, when added to any Shares owned by Parent and its Affiliates (excluding any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been “received”), represent at least one more than 50% of the total number of Shares outstanding at the Acceptance Time (such condition in this clause (b) being, the “Minimum Condition”). 


(c) any of the following conditions shall exist: (i) (I) there shall be any Restraint in effect enjoining or otherwise preventing or prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or the Offer or any Governmental Body has instituted (or has notified, Parent, Purchaser or the Company that it may institute) any Legal Proceeding that would be (or could reasonably be expected to impose) a Restraint on any party’s ability to consummate the Offer or the Merger or that would be (or could reasonably be expected to impose) a Burdensome Condition or (II) if the parties have entered into any arrangement with any Governmental Body regarding the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, such Governmental Body shall have imposed a Burdensome Condition; (ii) The representations and warranties of the Company (I) set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.2(a) (Capitalization) and Section 3.2(b) (Capitalization) shall not be true and correct in all respects (except for only de minimis inaccuracies) or Section 3.1 (Organization), Section 3.3(a) (Authorization), Section 3.3(b) (Authorization), Section 3.3(c)(i) (Authorization), Section 3.20 (Broker’s or Finder’s Fees), Section 3.21 (Opinion

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights and obligations of Purchaser and Parent to extend, terminate or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. 


Except for the Minimum Condition and the condition in clauses “(a)” and “(b)” above, the foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and applicable Law, may be waived by Purchaser or Parent, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to the Expiration Date in the sole discretion of Purchaser or Parent (other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Purchaser and Parent only with the prior written consent of the Company which may be granted or withheld in the Company’s sole discretion); provided, however, that any such waiver by Parent, Purchaser and/or the Company shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Purchaser or Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time, subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.

SEVENTH. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable either to the Corporation or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment or modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal. 


EIGHTH. (a) Right to Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person (a “Covered Person”) who was or is a party or is








________________


threatened to be made a party to, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature (a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such Covered Person, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was, at any time during which this Section (a) of Article Eighth is in effect (whether or not such Covered Person continues to serve in such capacity at the time any indemnification or payment of expenses pursuant hereto is sought or at the time any proceeding relating thereto exists or is brought), a director or officer of the Corporation, or has or had agreed to become a director of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust, nonprofit entity or other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered (including, without limitation, any judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including attorneys’ fees), actually and reasonably incurred by such Covered Person in connection with such proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by law, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided however, that, except as provided in Section (b) of this Article Eighth, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section (a) of Article Eighth and such rights as may be conferred in the Bylaws of the Corporation shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation. The rights conferred upon Covered Persons in this Section (a) of Article Eighth shall be contract rights that vest at the time of such person’s service to or at the request of the Corporation and such rights shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same (or lesser) scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. (b) Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. In accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, if a claim for indemnification under Section (a) of this Article Eighth is not paid in full within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person making such claim may at any time thereafter file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. (c) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. In accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, the right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred any Covered Person by Section (a) of this Article Eighth (i) shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise and (ii) cannot be terminated by the Corporation, the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation with respect to a Covered Person’s service occurring prior to the date of such termination.

To the extent that the Corporation maintains any policy or policies providing such insurance, each such person shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage thereunder for any such person.

Section 2.1. Annual Meetings. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws at such date, time and place, if any, as may be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation from time to time.

Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time only by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the whole Board of Directors or by a committee of the Board of Directors authorized to call such meetings and by no other person. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the special meeting shall not be held at any place, but shall be held solely by means of remote communication, subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, as permitted by applicable law.

If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder’s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. 


Section 2.4. Adjournments. Any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be adjourned from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, if any, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 2.3. 


Section 2.5. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum at each meeting of stockholders. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders so present may, by the affirmative vote of the holders of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by all such holders, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of these Bylaws until a quorum is present. If a quorum is present when a meeting is convened, the subsequent withdrawal of stockholders, even though less than a quorum remains, shall not affect the ability of the remaining stockholders lawfully to transact business. 


Section 2.6. Conduct; Remote Communication. (a) Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or if there is none or in his or her absence, by the President, or in his or her absence, by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. (b) If authorized by the Board of Directors in accordance with these Bylaws and applicable law, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication, (1) participate in a meeting of stockholders and (2) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of   2








________________


remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder, (ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation. 


Section 2.7. Voting. (a) Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power on the matter in question. (b) Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined by the holders of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding stock entitled to vote which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election of directors. Each other question shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, be decided by the vote of the holders of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all stock entitled to vote on such question which are present in person or by proxy at the meeting. (c) Stock of the Corporation standing in the name of another corporation and entitled to vote may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the Bylaws or other internal regulations of such other corporation may prescribe or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors or comparable body of such other corporation may determine. (d) Stock of the Corporation standing in the name of a deceased person, a minor, an incompetent or a debtor in a case under Title 11, United States Code, and entitled to vote may be voted by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator, debtor-in-possession or trustee, as the case may be, either in person or by proxy, without transfer of such shares into the name of the official or other person so voting. (e) A stockholder whose voting stock of the Corporation is pledged shall be entitled to vote such stock unless on the transfer records of the Corporation the pledgor has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote such shares, in which case only the pledgee, or such pledgee’s proxy, may represent such shares and vote thereon.   3








________________


(f) If voting stock is held of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (i) if only one votes, such act binds all; (ii) if more than one vote, the act of the majority so voting binds all; and (iii) if more than one votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter each faction may vote such stock proportionally, or any person voting the shares, or a beneficiary, if any, may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court as may have jurisdiction to appoint an additional person to act with the persons so voting the stock, which shall then be voted as determined by a majority of such persons and the person appointed by such court. If the instrument so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even split for the purpose of this subsection shall be a majority or even split in interest. (g) Stock of the Corporation belonging to the Corporation, or to another corporation a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of which are held by the Corporation, shall not be voted at any meeting of stockholders and shall not be counted in the total number of outstanding shares for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Nothing in this Section 2.7 shall limit the right of the Corporation to vote shares of stock of the Corporation held by it in a fiduciary capacity. 


Section 2.8. Proxies. (a) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy filed with the Secretary before or at the time of the meeting. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date. (b) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy (i) by executing a writing authorizing such person or persons to act as such, which execution may be accomplished by such stockholder or such stockholder’s authorized officer, director, partner, employee or agent (or, if the stock is held in a trust or estate, by a trustee, executor or administrator thereof) signing such writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, facsimile signature, or (ii) by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission (a “Transmission”) to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such Transmission; provided that any such Transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that such Transmission was authorized by such stockholder.   4








________________


(c) Any inspector or inspectors appointed shall examine Transmissions to determine if they are valid. If no inspector or inspectors are so appointed, the Secretary or such other person or persons as shall be appointed from time to time by the Board of Directors shall examine Transmissions to determine if they are valid. If it is determined that a Transmission is valid, the person or persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which such person or persons relied. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of such a writing or Transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or Transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or Transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or Transmission. 


Section 2.9. Fixing Date of Determination of Stockholders of Record. (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled (i) to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof; (ii) to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights; (iii) to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock; (iv) to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting; or (v) to take, receive or participate in any other action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which shall not be earlier than the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which (1) in the case of a determination of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be not more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of a determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall be not more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall be not more than 60 days before such action. (b) If no record date is fixed, (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (ii) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (iii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. (c) A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, but the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.   5

Section 2.10. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The Secretary shall prepare, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time thereof on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. 


Section 2.11. Action by Consent of Stockholders. (a) Unless the power of stockholders to act by consent without a meeting is restricted or eliminated by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on such action were present and voted. (b) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder (or his, her or its proxy) signing such consent. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting of stockholders by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of persons to authorize or take the action were delivered to the Corporation in the manner required by this Section 2.11. All such written consents shall be delivered to the Corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware, at its principal place of business or to the Secretary. Delivery made to the Corporation’s registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. (c) A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of these Bylaws, provided that any such telegram,   6








________________


cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (A) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (B) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. Any consent by means of telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been signed on the date on which it was transmitted. No consent given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, at its principal place of business or to the Secretary. Delivery made to the Corporation’s registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the Corporation or to the Secretary if, to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. (d) No written consent shall be effective to authorize or take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated written consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner required by this Section 2.11, written consents signed by a sufficient number of persons to authorize or take such action are delivered to the Corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware, at its principal place of business or to the Secretary. All such written consents shall be filed with the minutes of proceedings of the stockholders, and actions authorized or taken under such written consents shall have the same force and effect as those authorized or taken pursuant to a vote of the stockholders at an annual or special meeting.

If the Board of Directors is divided into classes, at each annual meeting at which the term of office of a class of directors expires, the stockholders shall elect directors of such class each to hold office until the annual meeting at which the terms of office of such class of directors expire and the election and qualification of his or her successor, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.   7

Each director elected to replace a former director shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he or she has replaced and the election and qualification of his or her successor, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 3.3. Regular Meetings. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, a regular annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held, without call or notice, immediately after and, if the annual meeting of stockholders is held at a place, at the same place as the annual meeting of stockholders, for the purpose of organizing the Board of Directors, electing officers and transacting any other business that may properly come before such meeting. If the stockholders shall elect the directors by written consent of stockholders as permitted by Section 2.11 of these Bylaws, a special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be called as soon as practicable after such election for the purposes described in the preceding sentence. Additional regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without call or notice at such times as shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.

In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law and provided in these Bylaws or in the resolution of the Board of Directors designating such committee, or an amendment to such resolution, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.

Section 3.9. Informal Action by Directors. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing (which may be in counterparts) or by electronic transmission, and the written consent or consents or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee. Such filing shall be made in paper form if the minutes of the Corporation are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. 


Section 3.10. Committee Rules. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, each committee designated by the Board of Directors may make, alter and repeal rules for the conduct of its business.

The Corporation may issue a new certificate for stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such stockholder’s legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate. 


Section 5.3. Transfers of Stock. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for stock of the Corporation (if such stock is certificated) duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer or, if the relevant stock certificate is claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon compliance with the provisions of Section 5.2 of these Bylaws, or, if such stock is not certificated, upon delivery of a duly executed and endorsed stock transfer power, and upon payment of applicable taxes with respect to such transfer, and in compliance with any restrictions on transfer applicable to such stock certificate or the shares represented thereby of which the Corporation shall have notice and subject to such rules and regulations as the Board of Directors may from time to time deem advisable concerning the transfer and registration of stock certificates, the Corporation may issue a new certificate or certificates for such stock to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and, in each case, record the transaction upon its books.

ARTICLE VI Notices 


Section 6.1. Manner of Notice. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, whenever notice is required to be given to any stockholder, director or member of any committee of the Board of Directors, such notice may be given by (i) personal delivery; (ii) depositing it, in a sealed envelope, in the United States mails, first class, postage prepaid, addressed; (iii) delivering to a company for overnight or second day mail or delivery; (iv) delivering it to a telegraph company, charges prepaid, for   12

transmission, or by transmitting it via telecopier; or (v) any other reliable means permitted by applicable law (including, subject to Section 6.1(b), electronic transmission) to such stockholder, director or member, either at the address of such stockholder, director or member as it appears on the records of the Corporation or, in the case of such a director or member, at his or her business address; and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when it is thus personally delivered, deposited, delivered or transmitted, as the case may be. Such requirement for notice shall also be deemed satisfied, except in the case of stockholder meetings, if actual notice is received orally or by other writing by the person entitled thereto as far in advance of the event with respect to which notice is being given as the minimum notice period required by law or these Bylaws. (b) Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation pursuant to these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation and shall also be deemed revoked if (1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by a form of electronic transmission in accordance with these Bylaws shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of such posting and the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by another form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. 


Section 6.2. Dispensation with Notice. (a) Whenever notice is required to be given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws to any stockholder to whom (i) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of stockholders, and all notices of meetings of stockholders or of the taking of action by stockholders by written consent without a meeting to such stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings; or (ii) all, and at least two, payments (if sent by first class mail) of dividends or interest on securities of the Corporation during a 12-month period, have been mailed addressed to such stockholder at the address of such stockholder as shown on the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting forth the then current address of such stockholder, the requirement that notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated.   13

(b) Whenever notice is required to be given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required, and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. 


Section 6.3. Waiver of Notice. Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee or directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice. 


ARTICLE VII Indemnification 


Section 7.1. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person (a “Covered Person”) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature (a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that such Covered Person, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was, at any time during which these By-laws are in effect (whether or not such Covered Person continues to serve in such capacity at the time any indemnification or payment of expenses pursuant hereto is sought or at the time any proceeding relating thereto exists or is brought), a director or officer of the Corporation, or has or had agreed to become a director of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust, nonprofit entity or other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered (including, without limitation, any judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including attorneys’ fees), actually and reasonably incurred by such Covered Person in connection with such proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by law, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators, and the Corporation may enter into agreements with any such person for the purpose of providing for such indemnification. Except as provided in Section 7.3, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in   14








________________


this Article VII shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time (and subject to filing a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2); provided, however, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation for such expenses under this Article VII or otherwise. The rights conferred upon Covered Persons in this Article VII shall be contract rights that vest at the time of such person’s service to or at the request of the Corporation and such rights shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee’s heirs, executors and administrators. 


Section 7.2. To obtain indemnification under this Article VII, a claimant shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.2, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant’s entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (b) if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), or (2) if a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (3) if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors unless there shall have occurred within two (2) years prior to the date of the commencement of the action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a “Change of Control” as defined in the GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within sixty (60) days after such determination. 


Section 7.3. If a claim for indemnification under Section 7.1 is not paid in full within sixty (60) days after a written claim pursuant to Section 7.2 has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final   15

disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.. 


Section 7.4. The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred on any Covered Person by this Article VII (a) shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of these By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise and (b) cannot be terminated by the Corporation, the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation with respect to a Covered Person’s service occurring prior to the date of such termination. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation’s obligation to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person has collected as indemnification from such other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, nonprofit entity, or other enterprise; and, in the event the Corporation has fully paid such expenses, the Covered Person shall return to the Corporation any amounts subsequently received from such other source of indemnification. 


Section 7.5. Any repeal, amendment, alteration or modification of the provisions of this Article VII that in any way diminishes, limits, restricts, adversely affects or eliminates any right of an indemnitee or his or her successors to indemnification, advancement of expenses or otherwise shall be prospective only and shall not in any way diminish, limit, restrict, adversely affect or eliminate any such right with respect to any actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission then or previously existing, or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission. 


Section 7.6. This Article VII shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by the Board of Directors. 


Section 7.7. If any provision or provisions of this Article VII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article VII (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Article VII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way   16








________________


be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VII (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article VII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 


Section 7.8. For purposes of this Article VII: (a) “Disinterested Director” means a director of the Corporation who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the claimant. (b) “Independent Counsel” means a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and shall include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the claimant in an action to determine the claimant’s rights under this Article VII. 


Section 7.9. Any notice, request or other communication required or permitted to be given to the Corporation under this Article VII shall be in writing and either delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram, overnight mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Corporation and shall be effective only upon receipt by the Secretary.

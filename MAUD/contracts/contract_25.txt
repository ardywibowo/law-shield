NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I 


The Merger 


SECTION 1.01.          The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the “OGCL”), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger.  The Company, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter referred to as the “Surviving Corporation”.

The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date”. 


SECTION 1.03.          Effective Time.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the OGCL (the “Certificate of Merger”), and shall make all other filings, recordings or publications required under the OGCL in connection with the Merger.  The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (the “Secretary of State”) or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto prior to the filing of such Certificate of Merger and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the “Effective Time”). 


SECTION 1.04.          Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable provisions, including Section 1701.82, of the OGCL. 


SECTION 1.05.          Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation.  At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to Section 6.05 hereof).  The code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation in effect from and after the Effective Time and until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law shall be in the form of the code of regulations of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Corporation.

The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation or until their respective successors have been duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.  The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation.  The parties acknowledge and agree that following the Effective Time Parent shall cause the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation to include at least two (2) individuals who are “domiciled” (such persons must have resided in Hawaii no less than five (5) years and otherwise be domiciled within the meaning of Section 18-235-1.03 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules) in Hawaii.

ARTICLE II 


Effect on the Stock of the Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates 


SECTION 2.01.          Effect on Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Shares”) or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 


(a)          Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 


(b)          Cancelation of Certain Shares.  All Company Common Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  All Company Common Shares held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  Each Company Common Share that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other than Merger Sub) shall not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be, at the election of Parent, either (i) converted into shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation or (ii) canceled. Each Excluded Share shall be canceled at the Effective Time and, subject to Section 2.03, no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 


(c)          Conversion of Company Common Shares.  Subject to Section 2.01(b), each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Common Appraisal Shares to be treated in accordance with Section 2.03 (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”)) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $15.50 per share, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).  As of the Effective Time, all such Company Common Shares, when so converted pursuant to this Section 2.01(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Company Common Shares (each, a “Certificate”) (other than any Excluded Shares) and each holder of Company Common Shares held in book-entry form (other than any Excluded Shares) shall, in each case, cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor.  The right of any holder of Company Common Shares to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of Section 2.02. 


(d)          6 3/4% Preferred Shares.  Each 6 3/4% Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding immediately following the Effective Time as one 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Share, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation, and shall not be affected by the Merger (except for the effects specifically set forth in Article Fourth of the Company Articles). 


SECTION 2.02.          Exchange of Certificates; Book-Entry Shares.  (a) Paying Agent.  Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, prior to the Closing Date shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares, for exchange in accordance with 


3








________________


this Article II through the Paying Agent, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). 


(b)          Letter of Transmittal.  As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the third Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) a form of letter of transmittal (the “Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an “agent’s message” with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify subject to the Company’s reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto. 


(c)          Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange.  Upon (i) in the case of Company Common Shares represented by a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, or (ii) in the case of Company Common Shares held in book-entry form, the receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent, in each case together with the associated Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate or held in book-entry form, as applicable, and the shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or share held in book-entry form is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) such Certificate or share held in book-entry form so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or share held in book-entry form surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has either been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each Company Common Share, and any Certificate with respect thereto shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holders of Company Common Shares were entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01.  No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or any Company Common Shares held in book-entry form). 


(d)          No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares.  The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or Company Common Shares held in book-entry form) in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificates (or Company Common Shares held in book-entry form).  From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Company Common Shares (or Company Common Shares held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 


(e)          Termination of Exchange Fund .  Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II.

________________


(f)          No Liability.  None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares immediately prior to such date on which the Exchange Fund otherwise would be required to escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 


(g)          Investment of Exchange Fund.  Pending its disbursement in accordance with this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.  Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith.  No investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. 


(h)          Withholding Rights.  Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 


(i)          Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II. 


SECTION 2.03.          Dissenters’ Rights.  (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to this Section 2.03), any Company Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal for such Company Common Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (such shares, “Common Appraisal Shares”), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such shareholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL; provided that if any such shareholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal pursuant to the OGCL, then the right of such shareholder to be paid the fair cash value of such Common Appraisal Shares shall cease, and such Common Appraisal Shares shall instead be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), without interest thereon. 


(b)          Subject to any redemption made in accordance with the Company Articles, any 6 3/4% Preferred Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal for such 6 3/4% Preferred Shares in accordance with, and who complies with, Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (such shares, “Preferred Appraisal Shares” and, together with the Common Appraisal Shares, the “Appraisal Shares”), shall not 


5








________________


remain outstanding as provided in Section 2.01(d), but instead shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such shareholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL; provided that if any such shareholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal pursuant to the OGCL, then the right of such shareholder to be paid the fair cash value of such Preferred Appraisal Shares shall cease, and such Preferred Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have remained outstanding in accordance with Section 2.01(d). 


(c)          The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Actions with respect to such demands.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.  Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 


SECTION 2.04.          Adjustments.  If between the date hereof and the Effective Time the outstanding Company Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any share split, reverse share split, share dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such share split, reverse share split, share dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change. 


ARTICLE III 


Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub 


Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company before the execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement (the “Parent Disclosure Letter”).  The Parent Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this Article III to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other sections. 


SECTION 3.01.          Organization, Standing and Power.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept).  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals (collectively, “Permits”) necessary to enable it to own, lease, operate or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted (the “Parent Permits”), except where the failure to have such power or authority or to possess Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties and assets makes such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.02.          Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub.  The Parent Board has adopted resolutions, by a vote at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of Parent was present, approving the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.  Such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn as of the date of this Agreement.  The Board of Directors of Merger Sub has adopted resolutions, by unanimous written consent, (A) approving this Agreement, (B) declaring advisable this Agreement and the Merger on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and determining that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Merger Sub and Parent, as its sole shareholder, and (C) recommending that Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, adopt this Agreement and directing that this Agreement be submitted to Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, for adoption.  Such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn as of the date of this Agreement.  Except for the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, no other corporate or similar proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions.

Letter” and, collectively, the “Debt Commitment Letters” and, together with the Equity Funding Letters, the “Financing Letters”), from the financial institutions identified therein (the “Commitment Parties”), providing, subject to the terms and conditions therein, for debt financing, in each case, in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the “Debt Financing” and, together with the Equity Financing, collectively referred to as the “Financing”).

No amounts will be payable to the Company Financial Advisors in connection with the Brookfield Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, except as are credited to any amounts payable in connection with the Merger or the Transactions.

immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives. 


(b)          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide oral or written Company Takeover Proposal, which Company Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 5.02, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person making the Company Takeover Proposal or its Representatives to request that any bona fide Company Takeover Proposal made orally be made in writing and (ii) in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take the following actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Company Proposal, the Company may (and may authorize and permit its Affiliates and its and their Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section 5.02(e), (A) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person making the Company Takeover Proposal and furnish information pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (including non-public information and data) with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) (provided that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person), and (B) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such Person’s Representatives).  Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02 by any Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.02 by the Company. 


(c)          Except as set forth below, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw or fail to make when required by this Agreement (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or propose or agree to withdraw or fail to make when required by this Agreement (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation or (B) adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or propose or agree to adopt, recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or propose or agree to adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any confidentiality agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement or arrangement (an “Acquisition Agreement”) constituting, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may (I) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (II) cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement constituting or that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal not obtained in violation of this Section 5.02 and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii), in either case if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), that (x) in the case of clause (I), where the Company Adverse Recommendation Change is made in response to an Intervening Event, or the consequences thereof, and the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) in the case of (A) clause (I) where such Company Adverse Recommendation Change is made in response to a Company Takeover Proposal, or (B) clause (II), such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not be entitled to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or take any action set forth in clause (II) unless (1) the Company has given Parent at least five Business Days’ prior written notice (a “Company Notice of 


34

Recommendation Change”) (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of any Superior Company Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of Recommendation Change and a new notice period (which shall be two Business Days instead of five Business Days)) advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action (which notice shall specify the identity of the party making such Superior Company Proposal and the material terms thereof and, in the case of an Intervening Event, specifying the details thereof), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Company Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Company Proposal or for such Intervening Event to no longer warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (3) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have considered in good faith such binding offer or Intervening Event, and shall have determined that the Superior Company Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Company Proposal if the revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect or that such Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and provided, further that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect unless the termination is in accordance with Section 8.01 and, to the extent required under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays or causes to be paid to Parent the applicable Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 6.06 prior to or concurrently with such termination so long as Parent has provided the Company with wire instructions for such payment. 


(d)          I n addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Section 5.02, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt thereof by an officer or director of the Company) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry or proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry or proposal, (ii) keep Parent informed in all material respects on a reasonably current basis of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Company Takeover Proposal, and (iii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written and electronic material exchanged between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the material terms or conditions of any Company Takeover Proposal. 


(e)          Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i) issuing a “stop-look-and-listen communication” pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its shareholders positions required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case after the commencement of a tender offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), (ii) issuing a statement in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal that does not involve the commencement of a tender offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), so long as the statement includes no more information than would be required for a “stop-look-and-listen communication” under Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act if such provision was applicable, or (iii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 5.02(c). 


(f)          For purposes of this Agreement: 


“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means (x) any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and after the date of this Agreement that contains terms and conditions, taken as

a whole, that are at least as restrictive on the Person entering into such confidentiality agreement with the Company as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill provisions or otherwise restrict the making of or amendment or modification to Company Takeover Proposals but shall not contain any exclusivity provision or other term that would restrict, in any manner, Parent’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (y) any confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. 


“Company Takeover Proposal” means any proposal or offer (whether or not in writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% or more of the total outstanding voting power of the Company, (iv) transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of the Company Common Shares or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger). 


“Superior Company Proposal” means any bona fide written offer made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or, in a merger, consolidation or statutory share-exchange involving such third party, the stockholders of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the Company Common Shares or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) (i) is on terms more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Shares than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal and the identity of the Person making the proposal) and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, and is fully financed or for which financing (if required) is fully committed or, in the good faith determination of the Company Board, is reasonably likely to be obtained.

In any such event, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate applicable Law, Judgment or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege or protection or risk such liability, including entering into a joint defense agreement, common interest agreement or other similar arrangement.

The table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement.  Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”.  The words “hereof”, “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.  The words “date hereof” when used in this Agreement shall refer to the date of this Agreement.  The terms “or”, “any” and “either” are not exclusive.  The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”.  The word “will” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word “shall”.  The words “made available to Parent” and words of similar import refer to documents (A) posted to the online dataroom by or on behalf of the Company by 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on March 1, 2020, or (B) delivered in person or electronically to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives by 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on March 1, 2020.

The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.  Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.  Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to “dollars” or “$” shall refer to the lawful money of the United States.  References to a Person are also to its permitted assigns and successors. 


SECTION 9.05.          Severability.  If any term, condition or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect.  Upon such determination that any term, condition or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. 


SECTION 9.06.          Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto. 


SECTION 9.07.          Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Equity Funding Letter, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.  This Agreement is not intended to and does not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except for:  (i) if the Effective Time occurs, the right of the Company’s shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article II; (ii) if the Effective Time occurs, the right of holders of Company Stock-Based Awards to receive such amounts as provided for in Section 6.04; (iii) if the Effective Time occurs, the rights

of the Indemnified Persons set forth in Section 6.05 of this Agreement; (iv) the rights of the Company Related Parties and Parent Related Parties set forth in Section 6.06; (v) the rights of the managers, directors, officers, employees, representatives and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in Section 6.15(c), which are intended for the benefit of the Persons and shall be enforceable by the Persons referred to respectively in clauses (i) through (v) above and (vi) the Debt Financing Sources, who shall be express intended third party beneficiaries of each of Section 6.06(e), the provisos to Section 8.03, this final sentence of Section 9.07, Section 9.08(a), Section 9.08(c), Section 9.09, Section 9.11 and Section 9.12 to the extent applicable thereto (in each case, together with any related definitions and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification or termination would serve to modify the substance or provisions or such sections). 


SECTION 9.08.          Governing Law.  (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED IN AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN THAT STATE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES (EXCEPT THAT THE PROCEDURES OF THE MERGER AND MATTERS RELATING TO THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF OHIO); PROVIDED THAT ANY MATTERS RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL SET FORTH IN SECTION 9.11 SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO ANY SUCH MATTER IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE CORRESPONDING PROVISION SET FORTH IN THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS. 


(b)          All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over any Action, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the Action is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof (such courts, the “Selected Courts”).  The parties hereto hereby irrevocably (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Selected Courts in any such Action, (ii) waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such Action brought in the Selected Courts, (iii) agree to not contest the jurisdiction of the Selected Courts in any such Action, by motion or otherwise and (iv) agree to not bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the Selected Courts, except for Actions brought to enforce the judgment of any such court.  The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.08(b) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto.  Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by Federal Express, UPS, DHL or similar courier service to the address set forth in Section 9.02 of this Agreement.  The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment. 


(c)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring, any suit, action or other proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source arising out of or relating to (x) the Debt Financing or (y) this Agreement or any

of the Transactions in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located within Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, whether a state or federal court, and each of the parties hereto agrees that the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section 9.11 shall be applicable to any such suit, action or other proceeding. 


SECTION 9.09.          Assignment.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except that Parent may assign, in its sole discretion, all of the rights, interests and obligations of Parent under this Agreement to (i) any Affiliate of Parent so long as such assignment would not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) pursuant to a collateral assignment of all of its rights hereunder to any of its Debt Financing Sources, but, in each case, no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement.  No assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder.  Subject to the immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 9.09 shall be null and void. 


SECTION 9.10.          Specific Enforcement.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary relief (including any fees payable pursuant to Section 6.06), even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement and the Transactions.  Subject to the following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.08(b) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in Section 6.06 (i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (ii) subject to the limitations contained in Section 6.06, shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to specific performance and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger Consideration and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (A) all conditions in Sections 7.01 and 7.03 were satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02, but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (B) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur.  The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid or contrary to Law, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.10 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. 


SECTION 9.11.          WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL .  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS

LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.  EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11. 


SECTION 9.12.          No Recourse to Debt Financing Sources.   (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company (i) agrees on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates that none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company and their respective Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions (including the Debt Financing), (ii) waives any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement (including any of the Transactions), any Debt Commitment Letter, any fee letters related thereto, the definitive agreements with respect thereto or the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (iii) agrees not to, and shall not, (A) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, for breach of this Agreement, or seek to recover monetary damages (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any special, consequential, punitive, indirect, speculative or exemplary damages or damages of a tortious nature) from, any Persons (other than Parent or Merger Sub) that have committed to provide or otherwise enter into Contracts in connection with the Debt Financing, including the Debt Financing Sources or (B) seek to enforce the commitment in respect of any Debt Financing against, make any claims for breach of commitments in respect of any Debt Financing against, or seek to recover monetary damages (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any special, consequential, punitive, indirect, speculative or exemplary damages or damages of a tortious nature) from, or otherwise sue, any Persons (other than Parent or Merger Sub) that have committed to provide or otherwise enter into Contracts in connection with the Debt Financing, including the Debt Financing Sources, for any reason in connection with commitments in respect of any Debt Financing or the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources thereunder, this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Debt Financing. 


(b)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any of the agreements relating to the Financing to the contrary, and without limiting Section 9.12(a), each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and Representatives, that all Actions, obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate to (i) this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein or the Transactions (including any financing obtained in connection with the Transactions), (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or such other agreement), (iii) any breach or violation of this Agreement or any other agreement referenced herein or (iv) any failure of the Transactions or any other agreement referenced herein (including any agreement in respect of financing obtained in connection with such transactions) to be consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are those solely of) the persons that are expressly identified as a party to such agreement or the Guarantors solely as and to the

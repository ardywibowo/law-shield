 ARTICLE II 


MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK   Section 2.1           Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of Merger I and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub I or the Company, or the holder of any share of Company Common Stock:   (a)               Conversion of Merger Sub I Common Stock. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)               Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held in treasury by the Company or is owned by any Parent Company or any Acquired Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist (the “Excluded Shares”), and no consideration or payment shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.   (c)               Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (A) the Excluded Shares and (B) the Dissenting Shares will, by virtue of Merger I and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (i) the Per Share Cash Consideration (as it may be adjusted), without interest, from Parent and (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Parent Common Stock”), equal to the Exchange Ratio, as it may be adjusted, (such amount of Parent Common Stock, the “Per Share Stock Consideration”) and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.3(e) (the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration the “Merger Consideration”).  


4    


    (d)         Treatment of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate” ) shall automatically be converted into and thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificates have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1.   (e)       Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who has not voted in favor of, or consented to, the Mergers and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who otherwise complies in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL (“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c), but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only those rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the “fair value” of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL); provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c) (without interest and less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.5) upon the surrender of the Certificates of Book Entry Shares previously representing such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and actions with respect to such demands at Parent’s sole expense. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, (ii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL, or (iii) agree to do any of the foregoing.   (f)          Adjustment.   (i)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or the securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be (including the treatment of Company Equity Awards in Section 2.4), shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such adjustment.   


5   


  (ii)         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary other than Section 2.1(f)(iii), to the extent that the sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Per Share Stock Consideration as of the Effective Time, plus (B) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock for which the Company Options to be assumed pursuant to Section 2.4(a) are exercisable as of the Effective Time, plus (C) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the cancellation of Company Options pursuant to Section 2.4(b) at the Effective Time, plus (D) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Parent RSAs to be issued pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and Section 2.4(e) at of the Effective Time, would exceed 19.9% of Parent’s issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (19.9% of such issued and outstanding shares rounded down to the nearest whole share, the “Maximum Share Number”), then (x) the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced (the amount of such reduction, the “Exchange Ratio Reduction Number”) to the minimum extent necessary such that the sum of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Per Share Stock Consideration as of the Effective Time, plus (2) the aggregate number of shares of Parent








________________


Common Stock for which the Company Options to be assumed pursuant to Section 2.4(a) are exercisable as of the Effective Time, plus (3) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the cancellation of Company Options pursuant to Section 2.4(b) at the Effective Time plus (4) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Parent RSAs to be issued pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and Section 2.4(e) at of the Effective Time, equals the Maximum Share Number and (y) the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be increased by the amount in cash equal to the Exchange Ratio Reduction Number multiplied by the Per Share Cash Consideration.   (iii)        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the quotient, expressed as a percentage, obtained by dividing (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration by (B) the sum of the Per Share Stock Consideration plus the Per Share Cash Consideration (for this purpose, including any other amounts treated as consideration other than stock of Parent, as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)) (the “Threshold Percentage”) (determined without regard to this sentence) is less than 45%, then the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be reduced, and the Per Share Stock Consideration shall be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis with such reduction, by an amount that would be necessary to cause the recomputed Threshold Percentage to equal 45%; provided, however, that this Section 2.1(f)(iii) shall not cause the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Per Share Stock Consideration as of the Effective Time to exceed the Maximum Share Number. To the extent the adjustment described in this Section 2.1(f)(iii) would otherwise cause the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Per Share Stock Consideration as of the Effective Time to exceed the Maximum Share Number, then, notwithstanding Section 2.1(f)(ii), the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be reduced as set forth in this Section 2.1(f)(iii) without a corresponding increase in the Per Share Stock Consideration. This Section 2.1(f)(iii) (including the defined terms used herein) is intended to cause this Agreement to satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e) (treating not less than 45% as a “substantial part” solely for such purpose) and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.   


6   


  (g)         Effects of Merger II. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of Merger II and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub II or the Surviving Corporation, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. The limited liability company interests in Merger Sub II shall not be affected and shall remain outstanding as the limited liability company interests of the Surviving Company, and Parent shall continue as the sole member of the Surviving Company.   Section 2.2        Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”), the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement relating to the Exchange Agent’s responsibilities with respect thereto, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.   Section 2.3          Exchange of Certificates.   (a)         Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, (i) shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing the full number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to pay the aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration and (ii) all of the cash necessary to pay the aggregated Per Share Cash Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3(c) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Parent Common Stock and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.   


7   


  (b)         Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time), to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form a s prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or duly executed affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or duly executed affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent (and reasonably acceptable to the Company), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash and the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.3(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Any holder of any Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal or any other deliverables to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.3(e), and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(c), and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith cancelled.   (c)         No dividends or other distributions declared or paid with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate of Book-Entry Share until the holders of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.3(b). Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or conversion of Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.3(b), there

shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or delivery, as the case may be, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender or delivery, as the case may be, and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or delivery payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  (d)         Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c). After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (e)         Fractional Shares.   (i)          No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued hereunder, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3(e), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock representing such holder’s proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(i) over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such excess, the “Excess Shares”). The Company and Parent acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE in the manner provided in the following paragraph.   (ii)        The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of Company Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (the “Common Shares Trust”). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Company Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Comment Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled.

  (f)         Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.3(c).   (g)         None of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent in accordance with Section 2.3(f)) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.3(c) in respect of a share of Parent Common Stock would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such share of Company Common Stock shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (h)        In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and the cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.   (i)          The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided, that no monetary losses on such investment thereof shall affect the Merger Consideration payable hereunder and, following any such losses, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, in the amount of such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that remains payable. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

  Section 2.4          Company Equity Awards.   (a)         At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Option granted under the Company Equity Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (“Parent Option Awards”) (A) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (rounding down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock), and (B) at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, it being understood that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock for which each assumed Company Option is exercisable is intended to be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 2.4(a), each Parent Option Award issued pursuant to this Section 2.4(a) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions, as those that applied to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each reference to the Company shall be deemed to be a reference to Parent.   (b)        At the Effective Time, each vested Company Option (including any Company Options that vest at the Effective Time) granted under the Company Equity Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled at the Effective Time, and the holder of such Company Option will be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, less applicable Tax withholdings (the “Option Cancellation Consideration”); provided, however, that if the per share exercise price payable with respect to any Company Option exceeds the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration with respect thereto. The Option Cancellation Consideration shall be paid in the same proportion of cash and Parent Common Stock as the proportion of cash and Parent Common Stock paid with respect to a share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and, if applicable, cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.   (c)         At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Restricted Stock Award that is subject to the terms of the COC Severance Plan (each, a “COC Restricted Stock Award”), shall vest as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the COC Severance Plan and (i) the shares subject to the vested portion of the COC Restricted Award shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such vested portion of the COC Restricted Stock Award entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the Merger Consideration, and (ii) any portion of the COC Restricted Stock Award that remains subject to any vesting, forfeiture or other lapse restrictions after the Effective Time (after taking into account the accelerated vesting granted under the COC Severance Plan), shall be assumed and converted at the Effective Time into an award of restricted shares of Parent Common Stock (“Parent RSAs”) in exchange for the remaining unvested portion of a COC Restricted Stock Award consisting of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of remaining unvested shares of Company Common Stock subject to such COC Restricted Stock Award multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 2.4(c), each award of Parent RSAs assumed pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions, including vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions, as those that applied to the corresponding COC Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each reference to the Company shall be deemed to be a reference to Parent.   


11   


  (d)         At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Restricted Stock Award that is not subject to the COC Severance Plan, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall vest as of the Effective Time and shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Restricted Stock Award becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award.   (e)         At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each award granted under the 2021 Executive Stock Performance Program (“ESPP Awards”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into shares of Company Common Stock with the number of shares of Company Common Stock determined based on actual performance for the portion of the performance period through the Effective Time as reasonably determined by the compensation committee of the Company. Such shares of Company Common Stock shall vest as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the COC Severance Plan and (i) the shares subject to the vested portion of the ESPP Award shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such vested portion of the ESPP Award entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the Merger Consideration, and (ii) the unvested portion of the ESPP Award shall be subject to service-based vesting terms as provided under the ESPP Award and, to the extent unvested at the Effective Time, shall be assumed and converted at the Effective Time into Parent RSAs as provided in Section 2.4(b).   (f)          Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary so as to cause the treatment of the Company Equity Awards as contemplated by this Section 2.4.   (g)        Any payments due pursuant to this Section 2.4, shall be made promptly by Parent following the Effective Time, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, in accordance with the Surviving Company’s and/or Parent’s payroll practices or the payroll practices of their respective Affiliates.

  Section 2.5         Withholding. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent (together with any of their respective paying agents) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Law with respect to Taxes. If an aforementioned party determines that any such deduction or withholding is required with respects payable to any holder of Company Common Stock (other than deduction or withholding required (i) with respect to compensatory payments, (ii) as a result of the

To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be filed with the SEC and distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and made available on the internet as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the other’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other the opportunity to review and comment thereon.

The Company will conduct a broker search in anticipation of the Company Stockholder Meeting in compliance with SEC Rule 14a-3, assuming the earliest record date practicable and, from time to time, conduct additional broker searches as reasonable requested by Parent.

The Company shall have the right to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) by not more than thirty (30) days in the aggregate (1) for the absence of a quorum, (2) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent that at such time the Company has not received a number of proxies that it reasonably believes sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (3) to allow reasonable additional time to distribute any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the Company Board has determined in good faith to be necessary under applicable Law or to give the stockholders of the Company sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosures that have been sent to the stockholders of Company or (4) to the extent required by applicable Law, or (B) with the written consent of Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company’s obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or public or private communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting for which proxies have been received by the Company and the number of such proxies authorizing the holder therefor to vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Transactions.

  (b)               Solely for the purposes of furthering the Mergers or for integration planning related thereto, and subject to contractual and legal restrictions applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the Company and its Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all of Parent’s properties, books, Contracts, personnel and records; provided, however, that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Parent or its Subsidiaries. This Section 5.5(b) shall not require Parent or allow any Acquired Company to perform invasive testing or evaluation (including any Phase II environmental testing) or permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of Parent would reasonably be expected to result in (i) the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or a violation of any of Parent’s obligations with respect to confidentiality if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) the loss of attorney-client or other legal privilege with respect to such information or (iii) the disclosure of competitively sensitive information in the case of documents or portions of documents relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive (including any Government Contract or Government Contract Bid).

All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.5(b) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.   Section 5.6           Further Action; Efforts.   (a)               Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Regulatory Law to consummate the Transactions, and no party hereto shall fail to take or cause to be taken any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within ten (10) Business Days from the date hereof (unless a later date is mutually agreed between the parties) and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other commercially reasonable actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as reasonably practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act, (ii) appropriate filings under any other Regulatory Law with respect to the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable and (iii) any other necessary, proper or advisable registrations, filings and notices with respect to the Transactions. Subject to applicable Law, and except as required by any Governmental Entity, the Company shall not agree to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law applicable to the Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent.

66   


    (b)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to (and the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not, without Parent’s prior written consent) (i) propose, negotiate, commit to, and/or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, transfer, license, disposition, or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets, properties, or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) terminate, modify, or assign existing relationships, Contracts, or obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or those relating to any assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) change or modify any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, or (iv) otherwise take or commit to take any other action that would limit Parent’s or its Subsidiaries’ or Affiliates’ freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their respective operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers, assets or rights or interests, or their freedom of action with respect to the assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement.   (c)               In addition, if any action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened) challenging the Transactions as violating any Regulatory Law or if any decree, order, Judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) is entered, enforced, or attempted to be entered or enforced by any Governmental Entity that would make the Transactions illegal or otherwise delay or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions, the parties shall have no obligation to take any action to contest, defend or litigate any such claim, cause of action, proceeding, decree, order, Judgment or injunction.   (d)               Each of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with obtaining requisite approvals and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any Action initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly notify the other party of any substantive communication made or received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, from any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any Action by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions (iii) subject to applicable Law, permit the other party a reasonable opportunity to review any substantive written communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any scheduled substantive meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or private party, and (iv) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Transactions unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend or participate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other side under this Section 5.6(d) as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause its respective counsel to comply with this Section 5.6(d).

  (e)               During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as required by this Agreement and except as set forth in Section 5.6(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent and its Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered into by Parent or any of its Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Outside Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of Parent or its Affiliates shall acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any assets of or any equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof, if that acquisition or agreement would reasonably be expected to: (i) materially increase the risk of not obtaining approval under any Regulatory Law or the expiration or termination of any waiting period in connection with Antitrust Laws; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Mergers or materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iii) prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date receipt of any Antitrust Law approval.   Section 5.7           Employee Matters.   (a)               Subject to the terms of Section 2.4(d) and this Section 5.7(a), for a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to, provide to each employee of the Acquired Companies who is employed immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Continuing Employee”), for so long as such Continuing Employee remains in the employment of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (i) base salary or wage rate and target annual bonuses that are in the aggregate, no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate and target annual bonuses (excluding any specific performance-based goals, equity or equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses, severance and nonqualified deferred compensation) being provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that for any annual bonus programs that provide for payment in the form of Company Common Stock or equity-based awards (“Equity Bonus Programs”), such Equity Bonus Programs shall continue for the length of the current performance period, and, at the end of such period Parent shall have the option to terminate such Equity Bonus Program after paying out all amounts owed to participants, (ii) employee benefits that are in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension plans, equity based compensation, change in control, retention, or retiree medical benefits) being provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those in effect with respect to such Continuing Employee as of the date hereof and as are set forth on Section 5.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

Continuing Employee is provided full credit for prior service with the Acquired Companies to the extent such service would be recognized if it had been performed as an employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any Parent Employee Plans but not for benefit accrual purposes of any of the Parent Employee Plans; provided that such crediting is permitted under the terms of such plans, and applicable law and does not result in duplication of benefits, and (ii) unless covered under another arrangement with or of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company, determination of benefit levels under any Parent Employee Plan or policy of general application in each case relating to paid time off or severance, in either case, for which the Continuing Employees are otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employees are offered participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Parent Employee Plan” means any employee benefit plan that is sponsored, maintained or contributed to (or required to be contributed to) by any Parent Company, including, without limitation, any “employee pension benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) or “employee welfare benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA). The Company shall provide Parent or its designee all information reasonably requested to allow Parent to comply with such obligations in this Section 5.7(b).   (c)               Without limiting the foregoing, if the Continuing Employees participate in any Parent Employee Plan that provides medical, dental, vision or prescription drug benefits, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts (or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Company) to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition, actively at work, waiting period and similar requirements, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Company Plans, and (ii) cause the Parent Employee Plans to honor any expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any corresponding Company Plan during the portion of the calendar year up to the date that coverage under a Company Plan is replaced with coverage under such Parent Employee Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. The Company shall provide Parent or its designee all information reasonably requested to allow Parent to comply with such obligations in this Section 5.7(c).   (d)               The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective on the Closing Date (and contingent upon the Closing), any Company Plan set forth on Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter effective as of the date set forth therein, unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any such Company Plan by providing the Company with written notice of such election at least thirty (30) days before the Effective Time. Unless Parent so provides such notice to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing, evidence that the Company Board has validly adopted resolutions to terminate such scheduled Company Plans on Section 5.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and taken all other actions necessary to terminate such Company Plans scheduled on Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, effective no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  (e)               Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to continue any specific employee benefit plans, or to continue the employment of any specific Person for any period of time. The provisions of this Section 5.7 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to, on or following the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Plan following the Effective Time or (iii) confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, labor unions, directors, or independent contractors of any of the Acquired Companies, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Section 5.7.   (f)                At the Effective Time, the COC Severance Plan and any agreement entered into pursuant to the COC Severance Plan shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent or the Company, be assumed by Parent.   Section 5.8           Notification of Certain Matters. The Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other of the receipt of (a) any written communication received from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions or (b) from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party sending or receiving such notice.   Section 5.9           Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.   (a)               For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing and costs of defense to) in accordance with the Company Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies as of the date of this Agreement each current and former director or officer of any of the Acquired Companies (each, together with such individual’s heirs, executors or administrators, an “Indemnified Party”), in each case against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements), Judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, “Losses”) in connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or fiduciary of any of the Acquired Companies at or prior to the Effective Time. For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of the charter and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of any Acquired Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring, or alleged to have occurred, prior to the Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.9.   


70   


  (b)               The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the Company obtaining, prepaid (or “tail”) directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification policies and fiduciary liability insurance policy or policies that provide coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing D&O Insurance”) that are no less favorable to the insureds (including as to terms, coverages, conditions, retentions and limits of liability) to the Company’s existing policy or, if substantially similar insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain such policies in full force and effect for the full term of six (6) years and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not pay an annual premium for the Continuing D&O Insurance in excess of three

hundred fifty percent (350%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such Continuing D&O Insurance at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect the then-current policies of directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification and fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company with respect to acts, omissions or events occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums for such directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification policies in excess of an aggregate amount of three hundred fifty percent (350%) of the last annual premiums paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for its existing directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnification policies and annual premiums for such fiduciary liability insurance in excess of an aggregate amount of three hundred fifty percent (350%) of the last annual premiums paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for its existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, but in each such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for each such respective three hundred fifty percent (350%) aggregate amount.   (c)               If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets, then, and in each case, Parent and the Surviving Company shall ensure that such surviving corporation or entity or the transferees of such properties or assets assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.   (d)               The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of any of the Acquired Companies or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with any of the Acquired Companies, in each case in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or under applicable Law. The provisions of this Section 5.9 and the rights provided hereby shall survive consummation of Merger I and Merger II and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

  Section 5.10       Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such reasonable steps as may be required or appropriate to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or who will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   Section 5.11       Anti-Takeover Statutes. No party shall take any action that would cause this Agreement, Merger I, Merger II or any of the other Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to this Agreement (including Merger I, Merger II and the other Transactions), each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II and their respective boards of directors (or other governing body) shall grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act reasonably to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on such transactions.   Section 5.12       Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company’s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.   Section 5.13       Stockholder Litigation.   (a)               The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any Action commenced after the date of this Agreement against the Company or any of its directors or officers by any stockholder of the Company arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (including any class action or derivative litigation, but excluding any demand for appraisal rights), which shall be governed exclusively by Section 2.1(e) and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status of any such stockholder Action. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, at Parent’s sole expense, in the defense or settlement of any such stockholder Action, shall give due consideration to Parent’s advice with respect to such stockholder Action and shall not cooperate and settle or offer to settle any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, the foregoing shall not give Parent or Merger Subs any right to direct the defense of any such stockholder Action against the Company.   (b)               Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any Action commenced after the date of this Agreement against Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their respective directors or officers by any stockholder of Parent arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (including any class action or derivative litigation) and shall keep the Company reasonably informed regarding the status of any such stockholder Action.

Section 5.15       Transfer Taxes. All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) incurred in connection with the consummation of the Transactions shall be paid by either Parent or the Surviving Company (when and as due).

 (b)               Each of Parent and the Company agree to cooperate with the other party and use reasonable best efforts in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and terminate its registration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act; provided that such delisting and termination shall not be effective until the Effective Time.

(a)               Parent, the Company, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II intend that the Mergers, taken together, be treated, and each of them shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers, taken together, to be treated, for federal (and applicable state and local) income tax purposes as a “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, and the Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of the Code), and each shall file all Tax Returns consistent with, and take no position inconsistent with, such treatment unless required pursuant to a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.   (b)               None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II shall take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or fail to cause any action to be taken that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers, taken together, from constituting a “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Code.   


73   


  (c)               Each of Parent, the Merger Subs, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts and will cooperate with one another to obtain (i) any opinion of counsel required to be delivered in connection with the statements made in the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and (ii) the opinion referred to in Section 6.3(d), in each case, regarding the treatment of the Mergers, taken together, as a “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Code. In connection with any such opinions, (i) Parent shall deliver to McGuireWoods LLP (or Latham & Watkins LLP, if applicable) a duly executed certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-1 or Exhibit D-3, as applicable (with customary assumptions, representations, exceptions and modifications thereto as shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel and reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable such counsel to render such opinions) (the “Parent Tax Certificate”), (ii) the Company shall deliver to McGuireWoods LLP (or Latham & Watkins LLP, if applicable) a duly executed certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit D-4, as applicable (with customary assumptions, representations, exceptions and modifications thereto as shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel and reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable each such counsel to render such opinions) (in each case of (i) and (ii), dated as of the Closing Date and at such other times as may be reasonably requested by McGuireWoods LLP (or Latham & Watkins LLP, if applicable) in connection with the filing of the Form S-4), and (iii) each of Parent and the Company shall provide such other information as reasonably requested by each such counsel for purposes of rendering such opinions.   (d)               If there is a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code that the Mergers, taken together, do not qualify as a “reorganization” described in Section 368(a) of the Code, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall take the position for federal income tax purposes that Merger I was a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of Section 338 of the Code and Merger II qualified as a liquidation described in Section 332 of the Code.   (e)               Parent, the Company, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II hereby adopt this Agreement as a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and the 368 of the Code and within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368- 3(a).   (f)                Except for the covenants in this Section 5.17 and the representations set forth in Section 4.14(n) of this Agreement, none of Parent, the Merger Subs, or any of their Affiliates makes any representations or warranties to the Company or to any other Person regarding the Tax treatment of the Mergers, or any of the Tax consequences of the Transactions to the Company or any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards. The Company acknowledges that the Company and the Company stockholders are relying solely on their own Tax advisors for Tax advice regarding this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions and agreements contemplated hereby; provided, that the Company may rely on the legal opinion of McGuireWoods LLP (or Latham & Watkins LLP in the event that Latham & Watkins LLP provides the legal opinion in Section 6.3(d)) solely for the purposes of Section 6.3(d).

      (d)        Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II would enter into this Agreement.

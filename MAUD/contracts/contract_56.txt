AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 


AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 24, 2021 (this “Agreement”), by and among New York Community Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NYCB”), 615 Corp., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of NYCB (“Merger Sub”), and Flagstar Bancorp, Inc., a Michigan corporation (“Flagstar”). 


RECITALS 


A. The Boards of Directors of NYCB, Merger Sub and Flagstar have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders and shareholders, as applicable, to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Flagstar (the “Merger”), so that Flagstar is the surviving entity (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity, the “Interim Surviving Entity”) in the Merger, and, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Merger and as part of a single integrated transaction for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Interim Surviving Entity will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into NYCB (the “Holdco Merger”), so that NYCB is the surviving entity in the Holdco Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Entity”). 


B. At a date and time following the Holdco Merger as determined by NYCB, Flagstar Bank, FSB, a federally chartered stock savings bank and Subsidiary of Flagstar (“Flagstar Bank”), will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Bank Merger Agreement, merge with and into New York Community Bank, a New York State-chartered savings bank and Subsidiary of NYCB (“NYCB Bank”) (the “Bank Merger”), so that NYCB Bank is the surviving bank in the Bank Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Bank”). 


C. In furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of NYCB, Merger Sub and Flagstar have approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and have resolved to submit this Agreement to their respective stockholders and shareholders, as applicable, for approval and to recommend that their respective stockholders and shareholders, as applicable, approve this Agreement. 


D. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and the Holdco Merger, taken together, shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 


E. In this Agreement, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe certain conditions to the transactions contemplated hereby. 


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the “MBCA”) and Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Flagstar pursuant to this Agreement.

1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place remotely by electronic exchange of documents at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date which shall be no later than the second (2nd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of all the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by NYCB and Flagstar. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the “Closing Date.” 


1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on or prior to the Closing Date, NYCB shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs of the State of Michigan (the “Michigan LARA”) and a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Secretary”) (collectively, the “Certificates of Merger”). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Certificates of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MBCA or DGCL, as applicable, or at such other date and time as shall be provided by applicable law (such date and time hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”). 


1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the MBCA, DGCL and this Agreement. 


1.5 Conversion of Flagstar Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of NYCB, Merger Sub, Flagstar or the holder of any securities of NYCB or Flagstar: 


(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Flagstar issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Flagstar Common Stock”), except for shares of Flagstar Common Stock owned by Flagstar or NYCB (in each case, other than shares of Flagstar Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Flagstar or NYCB in respect of debts previously contracted (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”)), shall be converted into the right to receive 4.0151 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of NYCB (the “NYCB Common Stock”) (the “Merger Consideration”). 


(b) All the shares of Flagstar Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an “Old Certificate”; it being understood that any reference herein to “Old Certificate” shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Flagstar Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of Flagstar Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) a New Certificate representing the number of whole shares of NYCB Common Stock that such shares of Flagstar Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Flagstar Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2, in each case, without any interest thereon. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of NYCB Common Stock or Flagstar Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to give NYCB and the holders of Flagstar Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed to permit Flagstar or NYCB to take any action with respect to its securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.   -2-

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Flagstar Common Stock that are owned by Flagstar or NYCB (in each case, other than shares of Flagstar Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties, or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Flagstar or NYCB in respect of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no NYCB Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 


1.6 Merger Sub Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share (“Merger Sub Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be converted into and become one share of common stock, no par value, of the Interim Surviving Entity. 


1.7 Treatment of Flagstar Equity Awards. 


(a) Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Except as otherwise agreed between NYCB and Flagstar, at the Effective Time, each outstanding time-based restricted stock award unit (a “Flagstar RSU”) under the Flagstar Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Flagstar Common Stock and shall be converted into a time-based restricted stock unit denominated in shares of NYCB Common Stock (each, an “NYCB RSU”). The number of shares of NYCB Common Stock subject to each such NYCB RSU shall be equal to the product (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Flagstar Common Stock subject to such Flagstar RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable dividend equivalents), multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, at and following the Effective Time, each such NYCB RSU shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms, after giving effect to any “change in control” post-termination protections under the applicable Flagstar Stock Plan or award agreement; provided that such protections shall be extended to apply until eighteen (18) months after the Effective Time) as were applicable to the applicable Flagstar RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


(b) Performance Share Unit Awards. 


(i) Performance Period Complete. Except as otherwise agreed between NYCB and Flagstar, at the Effective Time, each outstanding performance share unit award under the Flagstar Stock Plans (a “Flagstar PSU”) for which the applicable performance period is complete, including awards granted prior to the date of this Agreement under the Executive Long-Term Incentive Program and Flagstar PSUs granted in 2019, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a performance share unit denominated in shares of Flagstar Common Stock and shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the number of shares of Flagstar Common Stock subject to such Flagstar PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time based on actual performance through completion of the applicable performance period as determined by the compensation committee of the Flagstar Board (the “Flagstar Compensation Committee”) in its reasonable judgement, less applicable Tax withholding, which shall be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date and in no event later than five (5) days following the Closing Date; provided, that, with respect to any Flagstar PSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Flagstar Stock Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. 


(ii) Performance Period Incomplete. Except as otherwise agreed between NYCB and Flagstar, at the Effective Time, each Flagstar PSU for which the applicable performance period is not complete shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a performance share unit denominated in shares of Flagstar Common Stock and shall be converted into an NYCB RSU.

ARTICLE II 


EXCHANGE OF SHARES 


2.1 NYCB to Make Consideration Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, NYCB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent designated by NYCB and reasonably acceptable to Flagstar (the “Exchange Agent”), for exchange in accordance with this Article II for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, (a) certificates or, at NYCB’s option, evidence in book-entry form, representing shares of NYCB Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 (collectively, referred to herein as “New Certificates”), and (b) cash in lieu of any fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such cash and New Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of NYCB Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b), being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, NYCB shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Flagstar Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive NYCB Common Stock pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates representing the number of whole shares of NYCB Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, which the shares of Flagstar Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing   -6-

that number of whole shares of NYCB Common Stock to which such holder of Flagstar Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and (B) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of NYCB Common Stock which the shares of Flagstar Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2. 


(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to NYCB Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of NYCB Common Stock that the shares of Flagstar Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive. 


(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of NYCB Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of NYCB Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 


(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Flagstar of the shares of Flagstar Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates representing shares of NYCB Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2, as applicable. 


(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of NYCB Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to NYCB Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of NYCB. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, NYCB shall pay to each former holder of Flagstar Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of NYCB Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the consecutive period of five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Flagstar Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of NYCB Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.   -7-

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Flagstar for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity. Any former holders of Flagstar Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of the shares of NYCB Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the NYCB Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Flagstar Common Stock such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of NYCB, Flagstar, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Flagstar Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 


(g) NYCB shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of NYCB Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Flagstar Common Stock, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by NYCB or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Flagstar Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by NYCB or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 


(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by NYCB or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as NYCB or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the shares of NYCB Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and dividends or distributions, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Flagstar has the corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects. Flagstar is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Flagstar. As used in this Agreement, the term “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to NYCB, Flagstar or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability (including the Pandemic Measures) to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest rates and mortgage rates and terms) conditions affecting the industries in which such party or its Subsidiaries operate (including any such changes arising out of the Pandemic or any Pandemic Measures) and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) changes, after the date hereof, resulting from hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, floods or other natural disasters or from any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak of any disease or other public health event (including the Pandemic), (E) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on a party’s relationships with its customers or employees) (it being understood that the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.3(b), 3.4, 4.3(b) or 4.4) or actions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) a decline in the trading price of a party’s common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts (it being understood that the underlying causes of such decline or failure may be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred); except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the financial services sectors in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Each of NYCB and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NYCB.

There are no restrictions on the ability of NYCB or any NYCB Subsidiary to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of NYCB or an NYCB Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all similarly regulated entities.

In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party will provide the other with copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to filing and with sufficient opportunity to comment, other than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information or confidential supervisory information filed under a claim of confidentiality.

Neither NYCB nor Flagstar nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information, or otherwise comply with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2, where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of NYCB’s or Flagstar’s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or to the extent that NYCB or Flagstar, as the case may be, reasonably determines, in light of the Pandemic or the Pandemic Measures, that such access would jeopardize the health and safety of any of its employees. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

6.6 Employee Matters. 


(a) Commencing on the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2022, unless otherwise mutually determined by Flagstar and NYCB prior to the Effective Time, NYCB shall provide to employees of Flagstar and the Flagstar Subsidiaries who at the Effective Time become employees of NYCB or the NYCB Subsidiaries (the “Continuing Employees”) (i) a base salary or base wage rate no less than that provided by Flagstar and the Flagstar Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target incentive opportunities (both cash and equity) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the target incentive opportunities (both cash and equity) provided by Flagstar and the Flagstar Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits (other than severance) that are no less favorable than those provided to other similarly situated employees of NYCB or by Flagstar and the Flagstar Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NYCB and Flagstar agree that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the later of the first anniversary thereof or December 31, 2022, NYCB shall provide severance payments and benefits as described in Section 6.6(a) of the NYCB Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Continuing Employee who is involuntarily terminated during such period. 


(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of NYCB or NYCB Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (“New Plans”), NYCB and the NYCB Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of NYCB or its affiliates to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles, co-payments or coinsurance and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee’s employment with Flagstar and its Subsidiaries for all purposes under each applicable New Plan (it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, such service credit shall not entitle any Continuing Employee to benefits under any frozen NYCB Benefit Plan), as if such service had been performed with NYCB, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. 


(c) If requested by NYCB in writing delivered to Flagstar not less than twenty (20) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of Flagstar (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to terminate the Flagstar 401(k) Employee Savings Plan (the “Flagstar 401(k) Plan”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. If NYCB requests that Flagstar 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) Flagstar shall provide NYCB with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by NYCB) not later than two (2) days immediately preceding the Closing Date, and (ii) the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by NYCB or one of its Subsidiaries (the “NYCB 401(k) Plan”), it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan for Continuing Employees. NYCB and Flagstar shall take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to Flagstar 401(k) Plan and/or the NYCB 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions to the NYCB 401(k) Plan of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) from Flagstar 401(k) Plan in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans), NYCB Common Stock or a combination thereof in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such employee from Flagstar 401(k) Plan, and NYCB shall endeavor through reasonably commercial efforts to ensure availability of in-kind and note rollover. 


(d) On and after the date hereof, any written employee notices or communication materials for distribution to a group of employees (including any website posting) or broad-based oral communications (i) to be provided or communicated by Flagstar with respect to any material employment, compensation or benefits matters   -52-

(e) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Section 6.6, NYCB agrees to assume and honor, in accordance with their terms, all Flagstar Benefit Plans including with respect to any accrued paid time off, vacation or other approved leave, it being understood that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the ability of NYCB or any NYCB Subsidiary to amend or terminate any Flagstar Benefit Plan to the extent that such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable Flagstar Benefit Plan. NYCB agrees that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a “change in control”, “change of control” or other similar concept under any Flagstar Benefit Plan, and prior to the Effective Time, Flagstar Board (or the compensation committee thereof) shall be empowered to take such action as necessary to declare such status under such Flagstar Benefit Plans. 


(f) NYCB shall take all necessary action to cause the ESOP to be terminated as of not later than the business day prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the terms of the ESOP and applicable law, upon termination of the ESOP pursuant to the prior sentence, the accounts of all participants and beneficiaries in the ESOP immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested effective as of the effective time of the termination of the ESOP.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of NYCB or Flagstar or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Entity, Flagstar, NYCB or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Entity, Flagstar, NYCB or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of NYCB or Flagstar or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Flagstar Benefit Plan or NYCB Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Flagstar Benefit Plan or NYCB Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.12, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of NYCB or Flagstar or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Flagstar or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Flagstar or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that in the case of advancement of expenses, any Flagstar Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Flagstar Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. The Surviving Entity shall reasonably cooperate with Flagstar Indemnified Parties, and Flagstar Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving Entity, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 


(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Flagstar (provided, that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Flagstar or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the Surviving Entity shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Flagstar for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Entity’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Flagstar, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of, NYCB, may (and at the request of NYCB, Flagstar shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year “tail” policy under Flagstar’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap. 


(c) The obligations of the Surviving Entity, NYCB or Flagstar under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Flagstar Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent of the affected Flagstar Indemnified Party or affected person. 


(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Flagstar Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in each such case, the Surviving Entity will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. 


6.8 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of NYCB, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Flagstar, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Entity with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the Holdco Merger or the Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by NYCB.

have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it, or (ii) that it believes would or would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. 


6.10 Dividends. After the date of this Agreement and to the extent permitted under the NYCB Charter and Flagstar Charter, respectively, each of NYCB and Flagstar shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of the NYCB Common Stock and Flagstar Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of Flagstar Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of Flagstar Common Stock and any shares of the NYCB Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing, (a) starting with the fourth quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors of Flagstar shall cause its regular quarterly dividend record dates and payments dates for Flagstar Common Stock to be delayed so as to be similar to the regular quarterly dividend record dates and payments dates for NYCB Common Stock and (b) the Board of Directors of NYCB shall continue to pay dividends on the NYCB Common Stock on substantially the same record and payment date schedules as have been utilized in the past. 


6.11 Shareholder Litigation. Each party shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law and regulation, give the other party prompt notice in writing of any stockholder or shareholder, as applicable, litigation against such party or its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Flagstar shall give NYCB the opportunity to participate (at NYCB’s expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation. Each party shall give the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by such party in connection with any such litigation, and will in good faith take such comments into account. Flagstar shall not agree to settle any such litigation without NYCB’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that NYCB shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of NYCB and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the Effective Time upon the Surviving Entity or any of its affiliates. 


6.12 Corporate Governance. 


(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of NYCB shall take all actions necessary to adopt the NYCB Bylaws Amendment. Effective as of the Holdco Merger Effective Time, and in accordance with the NYCB Bylaws Amendment, the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of the Surviving Entity and the full Board of Directors of NYCB Bank shall each be twelve (12), of which (i) eight (8) shall be directors of NYCB immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall include the Chief Executive Officer of NYCB immediately prior to the Effective Time, Robert Wann, Hanif Dahya, who shall serve as the Presiding Director, and such other directors as determined by NYCB and (ii) four (4) shall be directors of Flagstar immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Flagstar Designated Directors”), which shall include the Chief Executive Officer of Flagstar immediately prior to the Effective Time, who shall serve as the non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of each of the Surviving Entity and the Board of Directors of NYCB Bank, David Treadwell, who shall serve as the Risk Assessment Committee Chairman of the Surviving Entity and such other directors as mutually agreed to by Flagstar and NYCB, who shall be independent of NYCB in accordance with applicable stock exchange standards.   -55-

(b) At the Effective Time, NYCB shall invite all directors of Flagstar immediately prior to the Effective Time other than the Flagstar Designated Directors to become members of an Advisory Board of NYCB (the “Advisory Board”), and shall cause all such individuals who accept such invitation to be elected or appointed for a two (2)-year term as members of the Advisory Board. Such members of the Advisory Board will serve on the Advisory Board until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date or until their respective earlier death or resignation, during which period such members will each receive quarterly compensation of $10,000 per quarter served. The Chief Executive Officer of NYCB shall meet with the Advisory Board at least one time per quarter during the two (2) year period beginning on the Closing Date.

(a) Each party agrees that it will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) to, immediately cease, and cause to be terminated, any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Flagstar, in the case of NYCB, or NYCB, in the case of Flagstar, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 


(b) Each party agrees that it will not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal (except (x) to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of such party, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.13 and (y) to seek and obtain legal or financial advice from such party’s outside counsel and outside financial advisors, as applicable), or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 6.13) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 


(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.13(a) or 6.13(b), in the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite NYCB Vote, in the case of NYCB, or the Requisite Flagstar Vote, in the case of Flagstar, a party receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data to and participate in negotiations or discussions with the person making the Acquisition Proposal, or any Representative of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its outside financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that, prior to furnishing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, such party shall have provided such information to the other party to this Agreement and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement (“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”), which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with such party.

If either Flagstar or NYCB shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Flagstar Vote or the Requisite NYCB Vote at the duly convened Flagstar Meeting or NYCB Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions provided for in this Agreement (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of Flagstar as provided for in this Agreement, or any term that would adversely affect the Tax treatment of the transactions contemplated hereby, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or stockholders, as applicable) and/or resubmit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.16) to its respective shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, for approval.

At and after the Effective Time for any debt of Flagstar or the Bank Merger Effective Time for any debt of Flagstar Bank, as applicable, NYCB or NYCB Bank, as applicable, shall (x) assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be performed by Flagstar or Flagstar Bank, as applicable, under the definitive documents governing the indebtedness set forth on Section 6.18 of the Flagstar Disclosure Schedule, and the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on, the notes governed thereby; or (y) repay such indebtedness in full.

Flagstar and NYCB agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of Flagstar subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the “Flagstar Insiders”), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Flagstar Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Flagstar Common Stock and Flagstar Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.19. Flagstar shall deliver to NYCB in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding Flagstar Insiders, and the Board of Directors of NYCB and of Flagstar, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of Flagstar) any acquisitions and dispositions of Flagstar Common Stock or Flagstar Equity Awards by Flagstar Insiders, and (in the case of NYCB) any acquisitions of NYCB Common Stock or NYCB Equity Awards by any Flagstar Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of NYCB subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to   -58-

material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date).

(b) by either NYCB or Flagstar if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger, the Holdco Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint or prohibition permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger, the Holdco Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 


(c) by either NYCB or Flagstar if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the “Termination Date”), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Flagstar, in the case of a termination by NYCB, or NYCB or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by Flagstar, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by NYCB, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by Flagstar, and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written notice to Flagstar, in the case of a termination by NYCB, or NYCB, in the case of a termination by Flagstar, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

8.2 Effect of Termination. 


(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either NYCB or Flagstar as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of NYCB, Merger Sub, Flagstar, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 6.14 (Public Announcements), this Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.13) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of NYCB, Merger Sub or Flagstar shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its actual and intentional common law fraud in such party’s making of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement (“Fraud”) or its Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement. “Willful Breach” shall mean a material breach of, or material failure to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in, this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching or non-performing party with actual knowledge that such party’s act or failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in or constitute such breach of or such failure of performance under this Agreement. 


(b) (i) In the event that (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to Flagstar shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of Flagstar or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of Flagstar generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to Flagstar Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Flagstar and (B) (x) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either NYCB or Flagstar pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Flagstar Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 were satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by NYCB pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a Willful Breach and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Flagstar enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Flagstar (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Flagstar shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay NYCB, by wire transfer of same-day   -62-

funds, a fee equal to ninety million dollars ($90,000,000) (the “Termination Fee”); provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “twenty-five percent (25%)” shall instead refer to “fifty percent (50%)”.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Flagstar pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then NYCB shall pay Flagstar, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of termination. 


(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other party’s Fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement, in no event shall either party be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once. 


(e) Each of NYCB and Flagstar acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if NYCB or Flagstar, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if NYCB or Flagstar, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” published in the Wall Street Journal on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full. The amounts payable by Flagstar and NYCB pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c), respectively, and this Section 8.2(e), constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of Fraud or Willful Breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the other party in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such applicable section.   -63-

ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11. 


9.12 Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each Flagstar Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. Except as provided in Section 6.7, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement of any third-party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement. 


9.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties’ obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate, and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 


9.14 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 


9.15 Confidential Supervisory Information. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty shall be made (or other action taken) pursuant to this Agreement that would involve the disclosure of confidential supervisory information (including confidential supervisory information as defined or identified in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c), 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g)(8), 12 C.F.R. § 4.32(b), 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g) and New York Banking Law § 36.10) of a Governmental Entity by any party to this Agreement to the extent prohibited by applicable law; provided that, to the extent legally permissible, appropriate modified or substitute disclosures or actions shall be made or taken under circumstances in which the limitations of this section apply. 


9.16 Delivery by Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were   -68-

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by the parties, the parties intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows: 


ARTICLE I THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS 


Section 1.1    The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the “TBCA”), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the








________________


Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”) and an indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. 


Section 1.2    Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at 9:00 a.m., Central time, on (a) the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI that are capable of satisfaction prior to the Closing (provided that all of the other conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI will be satisfied at the Closing), by the electronic exchange of signatures and documents and, to the extent physical exchange and delivery is required, at the offices of Bass, Berry & Sims PLC, 150 Third Avenue South, Suite 2800, Nashville, Tennessee 37201 or (b) such other date, time and/or place as is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the “Closing Date.” 


Section 1.3    Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable following the Closing on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger relating to the Merger (the “Articles of Merger”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, in such form as required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the TBCA, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings required under the TBCA or by the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the “Effective Time”). 


Section 1.4    Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the applicable provisions of the TBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the TBCA and other applicable Law. 


Section 1.5    Charter. Subject to Section 5.7(d), at the Effective Time, the charter of the Company shall be amended so that it reads in its entirety as set forth in Annex A hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the charter of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended, as provided by the TBCA and such charter. 


Section 1.6    Bylaws. Subject to Section 5.7(d), at the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided by the TBCA, the charter of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws, except that references to Merger Sub’s name shall be replaced by references to “J. Alexander’s Holdings, Inc.” 


Section 1.7    Directors and Officers. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that, from and after the Effective Time, (a) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, and shall hold such office until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, and shall hold such office until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified. 


Section 1.8    Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or the other securities described below: 


(a)    Conversion of Shares of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   2








________________


(b)    Cancellation of Company or Parent Owned Shares of Company Common Stock. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company (other than shares of Company Common Stock that are held either in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties) or by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Excluded Shares”), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 


(c)    Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (i) Excluded Shares, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Performance Share Awards or Company Restricted Share Awards, which shall be treated in accordance with Section 1.12) shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $14.00, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding, shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (a “Certificate”) or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 1.8(c), the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or cancellation of such Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 1.11. 


Section 1.9    Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within that period, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the Company Shareholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to that event. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 1.9 shall be deemed to modify the Company’s obligations under Section 4.1. 


Section 1.10    Dissenters’ Rights. Dissenters’ rights under Title 48, Chapter 23 of the TBCA are not available to the Company Shareholders as a result of the Merger. 


Section 1.11    Exchange of Company Common Stock. 


(a)    Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or shall cause to be deposited) with a nationally recognized financial institution selected by Parent with the Company’s prior written approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the Company Shareholders, for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE I, through the Exchange Agent, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (the “Exchange Fund”). Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to the Company Shareholders the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 1.8 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. In furtherance of Section 1.11(g), Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the cash included in the Exchange Fund is at all times until the first anniversary of the Effective Time maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make all such payments under Section 1.8. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts payable in respect of Company Share Awards or Class B Units shall not be deposited with the Exchange Agent but instead shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 1.12. 


(b)    Exchange Procedures. 


(i)    Certificates. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (or in the case of The Depository Trust Company on behalf of “street” holders, deliver), as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than four   3








________________


(4) Business Days) following the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares), (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall have such other provisions as are reasonably satisfactory to both of the Company and Parent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 1.11(f)) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration issuable and payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Excluded Shares) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, the cash amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.11(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 1.8(c). No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 


(ii)    Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE I. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book- Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an “agent’s message” or such other evidence, if any, reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent in compliance with the Exchange Agent’s customary procedure with respect to the exchange of book-entry shares (other than Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares), be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than four (4) Business Days) following the Effective Time, in respect of each Book-Entry Share held by such holder, the cash amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon cancellation of any Book-Entry Shares. 


(c)    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer Books. The Merger Consideration, when paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE I, upon the surrender of the Certificates (or upon receipt, in the case of the Book-Entry Shares), shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock previously evidenced by such Certificates (or Book-Entry Shares). No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Closing Date shall be paid to the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares). After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE I.   4








________________


(d)    Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the Company Shareholders on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee), upon written demand, and any Company Shareholder who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE I shall thereafter look only to Parent (or its designee) for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares five (5) years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity, will become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto. 


(e)    No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund (including any amounts delivered to Parent (or its designee) in accordance with Section 1.11(d)) properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 


(f)    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, to the extent reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as provided in this ARTICLE I. 


(g)    Investment. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed in writing by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent; provided that no losses on any investment made pursuant to this Section 1.11(g) shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to Company Shareholders entitled to receive such consideration, and, following any such losses, Parent shall promptly provide (or shall cause to be provided) additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of Company Shareholders entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. 


(h)    Withholdings. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable to any Company Shareholder and any holder of Company Share Awards or Class B Units pursuant to this ARTICLE I such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amount properly deducted or withheld pursuant to this Section 1.11(h) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Shareholder or holder of Company Share Awards or Class B Units in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period required under applicable Law. 


Section 1.12    Company Share Awards; Class B Units. 


(a)    Company Options. Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Incentive Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company Option”), whether or not then vested and exercisable, shall, in the manner contemplated by Section 1.12(d),   5








________________


immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of a Company Option, become fully vested and exercisable and, with respect to all outstanding Company Options: 


(i)    to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each such Company Option for which the per share Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share shall be canceled at the Effective Time and, in exchange therefor, the holder of such Company Option shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option; and 


(ii)    each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for which the per share Merger Consideration does not exceed the exercise price per share shall be cancelled without any payment being made in respect thereof. 


(b)    Company Performance Share Awards. Each performance share award granted under the Company Stock Incentive Plan that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company Performance Share Award”) shall, in the manner contemplated by Section 1.12(d), immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of a Company Performance Share Award, automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Performance Share Award, and (ii) the Merger Consideration. 


(c)    Company Restricted Share Awards. Each award of restricted shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Incentive Plan that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company Restricted Share Award” and together with the Company Options and Company Performance Share Awards, the “Company Share Awards”) shall, in the manner contemplated by Section 1.12(d), immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of a Company Restricted Share Award, automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Restricted Share Award and (ii) the Merger Consideration. 


(d)    Termination of the Company Stock Incentive Plan and Company Award Agreements. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company’s Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable Law and, as applicable, the Company Stock Incentive Plan and each agreement evidencing a grant of Company Share Awards (a “Company Award Agreement”) (including obtaining necessary consents or amendments) to (i) effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.12 and (ii) terminate, upon the Effective Time, the Company Stock Incentive Plan and each Company Award Agreement. 


(e)    Conversion of Class B Units. Each Class B Unit (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of J. Alexander’s Holdings, LLC, dated as of September 28, 2015 (the “LLC Agreement”)) of J. Alexander’s Holdings, LLC (“JAX LLC”), outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time and immediately prior to the conversion of Company Common Stock into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(c), in the manner contemplated by Section 1.12(f), become vested one hundred percent (100%), in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement and the related Unit Grant Agreements, and, with respect to all Class B Units: 


(i)    to the extent not exchanged prior to the Effective Time, each such vested Class B Unit shall be exchanged for Company Common Stock, to the extent eligible therefor, in accordance with the calculation set   6








________________


forth on Annex B hereto and pursuant to the terms of the LLC Agreement (the “Exchange”), immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in connection therewith, the holder of such Class B Unit shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the per share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued (or issuable) to such holder of Class B Units in the Exchange and such Company Common Stock shall not be required to be represented by certificates or by book-entry form and shall be deemed converted into the right to receive the amount in cash calculated pursuant to this Section 1.12(e); and

Allocations of the income, gain, profit, loss and deduction of JAX LLC for federal income tax purposes (and any corresponding state and local income tax purposes) for the taxable period in which the Closing occurs shall be made by applying the interim closing method and calendar day convention under Treasury Regulations Section 1.706-4 as of the Effective Time on the Closing Date. To the extent that a Parent Prepared Tax Return relates to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods, unless Parent determines that a different procedure, practice or accounting method is required by applicable Law (including a change in applicable Law).

At the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited or maintained) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds (if applicable), the aggregate amounts payable pursuant to this Section 1.12. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, the applicable holders of Company Share Awards and Class B Units will receive a payment from the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll   7

The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement a reasonable time in advance of the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel (it being understood that Parent and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be filed in definitive form with the SEC as promptly as practicable. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and giving reasonable and good faith consideration to any reasonable comments made by Parent and its counsel (it being understood that Parent and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and (subject to the preceding sentence) filed with the   35

The Proxy Statement shall include a copy of the Fairness Opinion.

If requested by Parent and permissible under applicable Law, the Company shall adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting for a period of up to ten (10) Business Days if, on a date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, a quorum is not present or the Company has not received proxies representing a number of shares of Company Common Stock sufficient to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies and votes in favor of the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the number of proxies received and its preliminary vote tabulation prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting.

A breach by any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of this Section 5.2 shall constitute a breach by the Company of this Section 5.2.

(iii)    the Company and its Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person or Group regarding such Acquisition Proposal; 


provided that, prior to taking any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) above, (x) such Person first executes a confidentiality agreement that contains terms limiting the use and disclosure of non-public information and imposing standstill obligations that, in each case, are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal, and that the Company may waive any such terms in any existing confidentiality agreements) (an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”) with the Company and the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that (A) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) the Company provides prompt notice to Parent of each such determination by the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) and of its intent to provide such information or engage in such negotiations or discussions. The Company and its Affiliates shall not enter into any agreement with any Person following the date hereof (including any Acceptable   37

(ii)    “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from twenty percent (20%) to fifty percent (50%)) and that the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, is (i) reasonably likely to be, and reasonably capable of being, consummated in accordance with its terms, and, (ii) if consummated, would be more favorable to the Company Shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, taken as a whole (including changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed in response to such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise by Parent that, if accepted by the Company, would be binding upon Parent and Merger Sub), taking into account and without limitation, (a) all financial considerations, (b) the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, (c) the anticipated timing, conditions and prospects for completion of such Acquisition Proposal (including any financing contingencies or arrangements), (d) the other terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the implications thereof on the Company, including all relevant legal, regulatory and financial aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and (e) any other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal reasonably deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof).

(ii)    approve or recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to Section 5.2(b)) (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”). 


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to Sections 5.2(e) and (f), at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, but not after, so long as none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives have breached in any material respect this Section 5.2, the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) may, if the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to an Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2 and that the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) is a Superior Proposal (giving effect to all of the binding written adjustments, if any, offered by Parent pursuant to Section 5.2(f) or otherwise), (y) subject to prior or concurrent payment of the Termination Fee, terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(d)(ii) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement if the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and/or (z) effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to an Intervening Event. For purposes of this Agreement, “Intervening Event” means any material event, fact, development or occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that is unknown to, and is not reasonably foreseeable by, the Company’s Board of Directors as of the date of this Agreement, that becomes known to the Company’s Board of Directors after the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event; and provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the following shall be considered or taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred: (1) changes in the trading price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock (however, the underlying reasons for such events may constitute an Intervening Event), (2) the fact alone that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published forecasts or projections for any period (however, the underlying reasons for such events may constitute an Intervening Event) or (3) any consequence arising as a result of the Company’s breach of any covenant or obligation to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing Date. 


(e)    Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.2; (iv) complying with the Company’s disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; or (v) subject to Section 5.8, making any disclosure to the Company Shareholders unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (including   39








________________


regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has determined to make in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to make a Recommendation Withdrawal other than in accordance with Section 5.2(d) and Section 5.2(f), and none of the communications, disclosures or actions contemplated by this Section 5.2(e) shall constitute or be deemed to constitute a Recommendation Withdrawal so long as (A) any such disclosure includes the Company Board Recommendation without any modification or qualification thereof or continues the prior recommendation of the Company Board and (B) does not contain a Recommendation Withdrawal. 


(f)    Notice. The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal with respect to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event or to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(d)(ii) unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the “Notice Period”), which notice in the case of (A) a Superior Proposal (a “Notice of Superior Proposal”) shall specify that the Company intends to take such action and include copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal (including copies of the then-current form of acquisition agreement, together with copies of any commitment letters or similar material documents with respect to any financing for such Superior Proposal), or if either the Superior Proposal or financing terms were not made in writing, a description of the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal or financing, as applicable, that is the basis of such action (including the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal), or (B) an Intervening Event (a “Notice of Intervening Event”) shall describe in reasonable detail such Intervening Event; (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisor and outside counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives in good faith to make amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (iii) following the end of the Notice Period, the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, taking into account any written amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub that, if accepted by the Company, would be binding upon Parent and Merger Sub in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Notice of Intervening Event or otherwise, that (1) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or (2) in the case of an Intervening Event, that such changes would not change the determination of the Company’s Board of Directors of the need for a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to such Intervening Event, as applicable. In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal or material changes related to such Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.2(f) with respect to such new written notice, except that the four (4) Business Day period referred to in this Section 5.2(f) shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days. 


(g)    Conditional Commitment. If the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has resolved to make a Recommendation Withdrawal and provide a Notice of Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 5.2(f), in order to enable the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) to be sufficiently comfortable that such Superior Proposal will remain available to the Company when and if this Agreement is terminated as and to the extent permitted hereunder in respect of such Superior Proposal, the Company may, before delivering a Notice of Superior Proposal to Parent, enter into a binding letter agreement (the “Conditional Commitment”) with the third party making such Superior Proposal (the “Committed Bidder”), which Conditional Commitment may (i) provide that the Committed Bidder is obligated, on behalf of the Company, to pay the Termination Fee and any other fee or expense required to be paid by the Company pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, (ii) attach as an exhibit thereto a fully negotiated agreement and plan of merger providing for the transaction contemplated by the Superior Proposal and/or (iii) provide that the Company shall enter into such agreement and plan of merger, and/or that such agreement and plan of merger shall automatically become binding on the Company, only on and after (and in no event before) both (A) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (B) the payment by the Company (or by the Committed Bidder on behalf of the Company) of the Termination Fee or any other fee or expense required to be paid hereunder; provided, however, that the Conditional Commitment may not (x) impose   40

on the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees any liability or obligation except upon the valid termination of this Agreement as contemplated in clause (iii), (y) impose on Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Financing Source or their respective former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees any liability or obligation at any time, including following the termination of this Agreement, or (z) relieve the Company of its obligations to Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, including its obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties further agree that, in the circumstances described in the immediately preceding sentence, until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (1) in no event may the Conditional Commitment permit the Committed Bidder to make any SEC or other regulatory filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Conditional Commitment until the termination of this Agreement unless otherwise required by Law and (2) the Company shall otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations under this Agreement applicable thereto. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with a true and complete copy of any Conditional Commitment. 


Section 5.3    Access to Information. Upon reasonable advance written notice and subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives, and subject to Section 5.15, the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources’ Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to its and its Subsidiaries’ properties, books, records, Contracts, permits, legal counsel, financial advisors, accountants, consultants and personnel, and shall furnish, and shall cause to be furnished, as promptly as practicable to Parent, all other information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries’ business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request in writing for purposes of diligence, integration planning, financing and facilitating the transfer of the ownership of the Company and its properties and assets; provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent required by applicable Law or Contract to which the Company or its respective Subsidiaries is a party (provided the Company uses reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the relevant counterparties and, failing that, redacts sensitive information and otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate the applicable information in a reasonable way that would not risk violating the applicable Law or Contract). All such access shall be subject to reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time with respect to the provision of privileged communications or any applicable confidentiality agreement with any Person. In conducting any inspection of any properties of the Company and its respective Subsidiaries, Parent, the Financing Sources and Parent’s and the Financing Sources’ respective Representatives shall not unreasonably interfere with the business conducted at such property. All information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall continue to be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may satisfy its obligations set forth above by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under the applicable Law (including as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures). 


Section 5.4    Consents, Approvals and Filings. 


(a)    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, (i) use reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its respective Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI hereof, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, as promptly as practicable, (iii) on the part of Parent, promptly obtain the Equity Financing and/or any alternative financing, (iv) on the part of the Company, and at Parent’s request, obtain payoff instructions and a customary payoff letter in connection with the repayment of, and the termination of any Contracts or Liens relating to, any outstanding indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the “Payoff Letters”) and (v) use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable any Consent of, or any exemption or waiver   41








________________


by, any Governmental Entity and any other third-party Consent which is required to be obtained by the parties or their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to comply with the terms and conditions of any such Consent, provided, however, that the failure to obtain any or all such Consents (in and of itself) shall not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect; provided, further, that the foregoing proviso shall not limit any remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub for a breach of the Company’s obligations under clause (v) of this Section 5.4(a) or Section 2.4. The parties shall cooperate with the reasonable requests of each other in seeking to obtain as promptly as practicable any such Consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any consent or similar fee, “profit sharing” or other similar payment or other consideration (including increased rent or other similar payments or any amendments, supplements or other modifications to (or waivers of) the existing terms of any Contract), or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty) to obtain the Consent of any Person under any Contract. 


(b)    Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and each of them shall cause its Affiliates not to, after the date hereof directly or indirectly acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license), by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division or part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, if doing so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any Consent or approval of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger. 


(c)    In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties shall as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement make all filings and notifications with all Governmental Entities that may be or may become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger, including: (i) not later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent each making an appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice with respect to the Merger and, to the extent available, requesting early termination of the initial waiting period under the HSR Act; (ii) the Company and Parent and their respective Subsidiaries each making any other filing that may be required under any other antitrust Laws or by any antitrust authority; and (iii) the Company and Parent making any other filing that may be required under any applicable Law or by any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any such Law. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to use reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be reasonably requested by a Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act or other applicable Law. 


(d)    The Company and Parent shall (i) furnish each other and, upon request, any Governmental Entity, any information or documentation concerning themselves, their Affiliates, directors, officers, securityholders and financing sources, information or documentation concerning the Merger and such other matters as may be reasonably requested and (ii) make available their respective personnel and advisers to each other and, upon request, any Governmental Entity, in connection with (A) the preparation of any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on their behalf to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or (B) any review or approval process. 


(e)    Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and, prior to submitting any substantive written communication, correspondence or filing by such party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, to any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand, the submitting party shall permit the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and   42








________________


consider in good faith the reasonable views of the other party that are provided in a timely manner, in connection with any such communication. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company and Parent and Merger Sub shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing (including, to the extent available, in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act). To the extent practicable under the circumstances, none of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any Filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), litigation, or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, where permitted, allows the other party to participate. Neither party shall be required to comply with any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4(e) to the extent that such compliance would be prohibited by applicable Law or in connection with customary or routine filing, correspondence or communications by Parent, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives to obtain any Consent from any Governmental Entity with respect to any Liquor License. The parties further covenant and agree not to voluntarily extend any waiting period associated with any Consent of any Governmental Entity or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the Merger, except with the prior written consent of the other party hereto. 


(f)    Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.4 as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel may be redacted (1) to remove references concerning valuation, (2) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, (3) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns and (4) to remove references concerning pricing and other competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective in the Contracts of the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries. 


Section 5.5    Employee Matters. 


(a)    In addition to any other obligation set forth in this Section 5.5, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the “Benefits Continuation Period”), Parent shall provide to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, while their employment continues during the Benefits Continuation Period (the “Continuing Employees”), (i) base salary or wage level and target cash bonus opportunities substantially comparable in the aggregate with the base salary or wage level (as applicable) and target cash bonus opportunities provided to them as employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to provide to any Continuing Employees any equity-based compensation or any auto- or vehicle-related benefits. 


(b)    Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Company and any predecessor entities for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (including but not limited to accrual of paid time off and levels of severance benefits under severance arrangements) with respect to the Company Benefit Plans and any replacement or successor benefit plan of Parent that a Continuing Employee is eligible to participate in following the Closing Date, except for benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) waive any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor welfare benefit plan of Parent that a Continuing Employee is eligible to participate in following the Closing Date to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such Continuing   43

Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated, and (iii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to the Closing Date (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket requirements. 


(c)    No provision of this Agreement shall (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan, or require Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to continue any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, (ii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, officer, director or other service provider of the Company or any of its Affiliates (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of continued employment by the Company, Parent, any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise, or (iii) in any way limit the ability of the Company, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the employment of any individual at any time or for any reason. 


(d)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates to, provide Continuing Employees whose employment terminates during the Benefits Continuation Period with severance benefits at levels no less than and pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 5.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 


(e)    Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at Parent’s request, take all actions necessary for the termination of each Company Benefit Plan that constitutes a plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each such plan, a “Company Qualified Plan”), as set forth on Section 5.5(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with such termination effective no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. The resolutions and other actions taken to terminate any such Company Qualified Plan, and any amendments required in connection with such termination, if applicable, shall be in a form and manner reasonably acceptable to Parent, and the Company shall provide Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that each Company Qualified Plan has been amended and terminated in accordance with the applicable Company Qualified Plan document and applicable Law. Parent shall, if a Company Qualified Plan is terminated as contemplated above, permit rollover (other than loan rollover) from such Company Qualified Plan. 


(f)    Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at Parent’s request, take all actions necessary for the termination of the Company Benefit Plans offering group health or welfare benefits, as identified by Parent prior to the Closing (the “Company Welfare Plans”), with such termination to be effective upon the Closing Date. The resolutions and other actions taken to terminate any such Company Welfare Plan, if applicable, shall be in a form and manner reasonably acceptable to Parent, and the Company shall provide Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that each Company Welfare Plan will be terminated effective upon the Closing in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Welfare Plan documents and applicable Law. 


(g)    Parent shall assume, guaranty and reaffirm and perform or cause to be performed the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) the salary continuation agreements set forth on Section 5.5(g)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including, but not limited to, the obligation to maintain and fund a trust pursuant to those agreements; (ii) the employment agreements set forth on Section 5.5(g)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the consummation of the Merger shall constitute a change in control for purposes of such agreements; and (iii) the Company’s bonus plans and shall perform and make payments no later than March 15, 2022, pursuant to the Company’s Cash Incentive Performance Program, Multi-Unit Operations Personnel Cash Incentive Performance Plan, J. Alexander’s, LLC Restaurant Management Incentive Plan, Stoney River Restaurant Management Incentive Plan and other bonus plans with respect to the Company’s 2021 fiscal year for employees whose employment continues after the date of this Agreement in   44

accordance with Section 5.5(g)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that the Company may elect to pay a prorated bonus prior to Closing with respect to the first half of the 2021 fiscal year, in which case, after the Closing, Parent will cause prorated bonuses to be paid pursuant to these bonus plans for the remainder of the 2021 fiscal year in accordance with Section 5.5(g)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 


Section 5.6    Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses. As used in this Agreement, “Expenses” includes all out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party and its Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Merger. 


Section 5.7    Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance. 


(a)    From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation (as the case may be) to, to the same extent that the Company is required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance expenses to) the applicable Indemnified Party under applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws or the organizational documents of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company as of the date hereof, indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance expenses from time to time as incurred, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced complies with the provisions of Section 48-18-504 of the TBCA or other applicable Law and provides statements and reasonable documentation therefor) the present and former directors and officers of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any Person acting as director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another entity or enterprise (including any Company Benefit Plan or any Subsidiary of the Company) at the request of the Company and the members of JAX LLC that are entitled to indemnification under the LLC Agreement (each an “Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all actual, documented costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, arising out of, relating to, or in connection with, any circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time, including the approval of this Agreement and the Merger or arising out of or pertaining to the Merger, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time; provided, that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides written affirmation of the Indemnified Party’s good faith determination that any applicable standard of conduct required by the TBCA or other applicable Law has been met. 


(b)    An Indemnified Party shall notify the Surviving Corporation in writing promptly upon learning of any Proceeding or other matter in respect of which such indemnification may be sought. The Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and control the defense of any act or omission covered under this Section 5.7 (each, a “Claim”) with counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the applicable Indemnified Party; provided, however, that (i) such Indemnified Party shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at his or her own expense; and (ii) if the Surviving Corporation assumes the defense, then the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to conduct a vigorous defense of such matter; provided, further, that in respect of any matter for which the Surviving Corporation has assumed the defense of such Claim, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to (without the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to such Claim for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out of such Claim, and does not include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party.   45

(c)    Subject to the following sentence, the Company may, and if the Company does not the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or any successor) to, purchase, at no expense to the beneficiaries, a six (6) year extended reporting period endorsement with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance having terms and conditions at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Company’s currently existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (a “Reporting Tail Endorsement”) and maintain this endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. To the extent purchased after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, such insurance policies shall be placed through such broker(s) and with such insurance carriers as may be specified by Parent and as are reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided, that such insurance carrier has at least an “A” rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to (or the Company be permitted to) expend for such policy an aggregate amount in excess of 300% of the annual renewal premium amount applicable to the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance at the time the Reporting Tail Endorsement is purchased, it being understood that if the premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to (or the Company may only) obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount. 


(d)    Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the provisions in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to the facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time under applicable Law.

(f)    From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the advancement and reimbursement of expenses, exculpation, indemnification provisions of the agreements listed in Section 5.7(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule between the Company or any Subsidiary and any of the Indemnified Parties. 


(g)    This Section 5.7 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. The obligations of Parent under this Section 5.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party unless (i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in advance in writing to such termination or modification. It is expressly agreed that each Indemnified Party shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.7, and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.7. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 5.7 that is denied by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay such Indemnified Party’s costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation. The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.7 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents or agreements) of any of the Company’s Subsidiaries or the charter or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or under any applicable Contracts, insurance policies or Laws and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation   46

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent (or its designee) pursuant to this Section 7.3, such payment shall (other than in the event of a Willful and Material Breach by the Company) be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives (the “Company Related Parties”), and none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii) and Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee to the Company (or its designee) pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company’s (or its designee’s) receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Financing Source and their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives (the “Parent Related Parties”) for all losses and damages in respect of this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or the failure of such transactions to occur for any reason or for no reason) or any breach (other than in the event a Willful and Material Breach) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3, (A) none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) none of the Company Related Parties shall seek to recover any other damages or seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.

________________


and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The phrases “the date of this Agreement,” “the date hereof” and terms of similar import, shall be deemed to refer to the date first above written. Whenever the content of this Agreement permits, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, and a reference to singular or plural shall be interchangeable with the other. 


(b)    References to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of that Person. References to any statute are to that statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. References to “$” and “dollars” are to the currency of the United States. References from or through any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including, respectively. The words “hereby,” “herein,” “hereof,” “hereunder” and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any Schedules delivered herewith) and not merely to the specific section, paragraph or clause in which such word appears. Whenever the words “include,” or “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” 


(c)    The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 


(d)    Any references to an agreement or organizational document herein shall mean such agreement or organizational document, as may be amended, modified and/or supplemented (and/or as any provision thereunder may be waived) from time to time in accordance with its terms. 


(e)    No summary of this Agreement or any Schedule delivered herewith prepared by or on behalf of any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any such Schedule.

Section 8.4    Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity. 


Section 8.5    Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. 


(a)    This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement collectively constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties and/or any other Person with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 


(b)    This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party except for (in each case, only following the Effective Time): (i) the right of the Company Shareholders and holders of   56

(c)    The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties and speak only as to the matters expressly set forth herein and may not be relied upon for any purpose other than for the purpose of the transactions to be performed pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties in accordance with Section 8.9 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 


Section 8.6    Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Merger is consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 


Section 8.7    Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub are expressly permitted to assign their rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent (including by way of a transfer of shares of capital stock of Merger Sub), and any such Person shall be entitled to assume Parent’s and/or Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement; provided, that no such assignment and assumption shall release Parent or Merger Sub from any of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent not performed. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 


Section 8.8    Modification or Amendment. Subject to the provisions of applicable Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective parties. 


Section 8.9    Extension; Waiver. The conditions to each of the parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Laws. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.   57

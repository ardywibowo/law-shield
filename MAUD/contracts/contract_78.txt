  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this “Agreement”), dated June 15, 2021, is by and among Elanco Animal Health Incorporated, an Indiana corporation (“Parent”), Knight Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and Kindred Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Annex I or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties”.   RECITALS   WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company being the surviving entity, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”);   WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain holders of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock” or, such shares, “Company Shares”) are entering support agreements with Parent in the form of Exhibit A (the “Support Agreements”) simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the “Company Board of Directors”) has (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Transactions”), including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Shares vote to approve the adoption of this Agreement (such recommendation, the “Company Board Recommendation”); and   WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective stockholders.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:   


    


  ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section 1.1.          The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”).  








________________


Section 1.2.          Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place as soon as practicable, but in any event no later three (3) business days, following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Morrison & Foerster LLP, 425 Market Street, San Francisco CA 94105, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the “Closing Date”.   Section 1.3.          Effective Time.   (a)               Concurrently with the Closing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) with respect to the Merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Secretary of State”), as provided under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such later date and time as is agreed between the Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time being referred to herein as the “Effective Time”).   (b)               The Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all of the rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities and duties, of the Company and Merger Sub, as provided under the applicable sections of the DGCL.   ARTICLE II    SURVIVING CORPORATION   Section 2.1.          Governing Documents. Subject to Section 7.5, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws.   Section 2.2.          Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation.   (a)               From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)               From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  ARTICLE III 


TREATMENT OF SECURITIES   Section 3.1.          Treatment of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:   (a)               Conversion of Company Securities. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Company Restricted Stock but not including Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $9.25 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, the holders of certificates (the “Certificates”) or book-entry shares (“Book-Entry Shares”) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Shares (including Company Restricted Stock but not including the Cancelled Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration or, with respect to Dissenting Shares, the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.   (b)               Cancellation of Company Common Stock. Each Company Share held by the Company as treasury stock (or by any wholly owned subsidiary thereof) or held by Parent or Merger Sub (or by any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such Company Shares collectively, the “Cancelled Shares”).   (c)               Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (d)               Adjustment to Merger Consideration. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and other than as contemplated by this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of Company Shares shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), division or subdivision of shares or other similar transaction, or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 3.1(d) shall permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.   Section 3.2.          Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.    (a)               Exchange Fund. Prior to Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the “Paying Agent”), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the funds to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant to the Merger. Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or promptly following the Effective Time and on the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock (excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) all of the funds necessary to make the aggregate payments of the Merger Consideration due under Section 3.1 (the “Exchange Fund”). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 3.1, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 3.2(c), except as expressly provided for in this Agreement; provided that any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to the Exchange Fund shall be the property of Parent.   (b)               Procedures for Surrender. As promptly as practicable (and in any event not later than the third (3rd) business day) following the








________________


Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing Company Shares that pursuant to Section 3.1(a) were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time may reasonably specify, and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration into which the number of Company Shares previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.

  (c)               Payment Procedures. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or affidavit of loss and compliance with such other requirements in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.2(f)) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, and such other documents as may be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Company Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2(c), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Shares evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (d)               Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise provided herein. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.   (e)               Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent’s routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and in compliance with the procedures in Section 3.2(b), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (f)                Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, and subject to such holder’s compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in Section 3.2(b) (other than the surrender of a Certificate), the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.1.   


-4-   


  Section 3.3.          Dissenter’s Rights.   (a)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) held by a holder who has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of such consideration as may be determined to be due in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then such Company Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificates formerly representing such Company Shares or transfer of such Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be.   (b)               The Company shall give prompt (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any such appraisal demands. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) with respect to Company Shares that become Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent upon demand therefor.   Section 3.4.          Treatment of Company Equity Awards.   (a)               At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (the “Company Restricted Stock”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest (to the extent such Company Restricted Stock would not otherwise vest) and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and be treated in the same manner as all other Company Shares for such purposes.








________________


 (b)               Each option to purchase Company Shares (other than rights to purchase Company Shares under the Company ESPP), whether vested or unvested and whether subject to time-based or performance-based vesting, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company Option”) shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Company Option would not otherwise vest) and be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Company Share of such Company Option by (ii) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the amount described in this Section 3.4(b), if any. Parent shall, or, if applicable, shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay to the holders of Company Options the cash amounts described in the second preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any other applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to such payment, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10) calendar days) following the Effective Time. Any Company Option with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.   (c)               Each award of restricted stock units denominated in Company Shares, whether subject to time-based or performance-based vesting, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company RSU Award”), shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested or to the extent such Company RSU Award would not otherwise vest) and be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration. Parent shall, or, if applicable, shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay to the holders of Company RSU Awards the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any other applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to such payment, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10) calendar days) following the Effective Time (or, if applicable, such later date required by Section 409A of the Code).   (d)               In the case of any Company Options or Company RSU Awards that are subject to performance periods that are ongoing as of the Effective Time, performance conditions shall be deemed satisfied (to the extent such performance conditions would not otherwise be deemed satisfied) at the greater of target and actual performance (as determined by the Board) as of the Effective Time.   


-5-   


  (e)               As of the Effective Time, all Stock Plans shall be terminated, and no further Company Shares, Company Equity Awards or other rights with respect to Company Shares shall be granted thereunder.   (f)                Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with and reasonably assist Parent to cause the timely payment of the amounts Parent is required to pay following the Effective Time to the holders of Company Options pursuant to Section 3.4(b) and to the holders of Company RSU Awards pursuant Section 3.4(c), including by providing all information reasonably requested by Parent that is reasonably necessary to make timely payments thereof.   (g)               The Company, the Company Board of Directors and the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, (i) shall take all actions necessary to (A) terminate the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Company ESPP”) and all outstanding rights thereunder as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (B) ensure that, from and after the date hereof, no new participants are permitted to participate in the Company ESPP and participants may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (C) ensure that, except for the offering or purchase period (if any) under the Company ESPP that is in effect on the date hereof (the “Final Offering Period”), from and after the date hereof, no offering or purchase period shall be authorized or commenced, and (D) provide notice to participants describing the treatment of the Company ESPP pursuant to this Section 3.4(f) and (E) otherwise effectuate the treatment of the Company ESPP as contemplated in this Section 3.4(f); and (ii) shall provide to Parent, prior to the Closing, reasonable evidence of the completion of the actions described in the immediately preceding clause (i). If the Effective Time occurs during the Final Offering Period, the Final Offering Period shall terminate no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall cause the exercise date applicable to the Final Offering Period to accelerate and occur on such termination date with respect to any then-outstanding purchase rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) all amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the Company ESPP at the end of the Final Offering Period shall thereupon be used to purchase whole Company Shares under the terms of the Company ESPP for such offering period, which Company Shares shall be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a) following the purchase of the Company Shares and (y) the Company shall return to each participant the funds, if any, that remain in such participant’s account after such purchase.   (h)               Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including obtaining any required consents) to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 3.4(h).   Section 3.5.          Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or such Paying Agent determines to be required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or such Paying Agent shall timely remit the withheld amount to the Governmental Entity.

In addition, for the sake of clarity, Parent does not have the right to direct and control any litigation, including any defenses, which right remains with the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary, as appropriate.   (d)               Notwithstanding Section 10.5, any request by the Company to Parent to take any of the actions set forth in Section 6.1(b) (iii), (xii), (xv), (xx), or (xxiv) (solely as (xxiv) relates to the other clauses of Section 6.1(b) referred to in this Section 6.1(d)) shall be made by email to the addresses set forth on Schedule I, and Parent’s consent to any such request shall be deemed granted if Parent does not deny such request (with an explanation for such denial) within five (5) business days after receipt of such request in accordance with this Section 6.1(d) (provided that such five (5) business day period shall be extended to the date that is two (2) business days after the date on which the Company responds to all reasonable requests of Parent for information reasonably necessary for Parent to approve or deny such request).

  (ii)              neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, or shall authorize or permit the Company to, (1) withhold, withdraw, fail to include in (or remove from) the Proxy Statement, amend or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, fail to include in (or remove from) the Proxy Statement, amend or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (2) approve, recommend or submit to the holders of Company Shares or declare advisable or make any recommendation other than a rejection of, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or submit to the holders of Company Shares or declare advisable or make any recommendation other than a rejection of, any Acquisition Proposal, (3) fail to (x) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation and (y) recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer by the holders of Company Shares pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act for outstanding Company Shares, in each case, within ten (10) business days after receipt of a written request of Parent following an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly announced (in the case of clause (x)), or the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer (in the case of clause (y)); provided that the taking of no position or a neutral position by the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof in respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of any such offer, or (4) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing in this clause (ii) (any act described in clause (ii) above, a “Change of Recommendation”).   In addition, the Company shall immediately, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees and other Representatives engaged by the Company in connection with the Transactions to immediately, (x) cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties (or provision of any nonpublic information to any parties) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, (y) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal, and (z) in no event later than two (2) business days following the date of this Agreement, request the return from all such parties, or request that all such parties cause the destruction, of all copies of confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their respective Representatives (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Persons that contain, reflect or analyze any such confidential information). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce such return or destruction pursuant to the terms of each confidentiality agreement entered into with such Persons. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company or the Company Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.2(a) by the Company. For purposes of this Section 6.2(a), the term “Person” shall not include Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other affiliate of Parent or any of their Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the Company’s Representatives may in any event inform a Person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is considering making any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer relating to an Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this Section 6.2.   (b)               Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.2(a) or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Company receives, after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal in circumstances not arising from a breach of Section 6.2 which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and, in each case, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law, then in either event the Company may enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and thereafter take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives (including potential financing sources), and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives (including potential financing sources) with respect to the Acquisition Proposal.

   (c)               The Company shall notify Parent in writing promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person in connection therewith, that expressly contemplates or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall (i) indicate the identity of the Person(s) making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request, and (ii) include a copy of the applicable written Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request (or, if oral, a summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or the nature of the information requested). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis (including upon the request of Parent) of the material developments, status of discussions or negotiations, and material terms (including any amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, including by providing a copy of material documentation (which shall include any proposals or offers) relating thereto that is exchanged between the Person (or its Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal and the Company (or its Representatives) within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt thereof. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent any nonpublic information concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent.   (d)               Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Section 6.2 or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, except for and subject to Section 6.2(e), at any time prior to the obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, the Company Board of Directors may:   (i)                 make a Change of Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h) in order to enter a Specified Agreement, which the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal and financial advisors, and after considering any amendments offered by Parent during the period contemplated by Section 6.2(e)(i), is a Superior Proposal, if, and only if, such Change of Recommendation and such termination did not result from a violation of Section 6.2 and if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or   


-37-   


  (ii)              make a Change of Recommendation, if, and only if, such Change of Recommendation is in connection with any material change, event, fact, development or occurrence, other than relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, that was not known or reasonably foreseeable, or the consequences of which (or the magnitude of which or the magnitude of the consequences of which) were not known or reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement, by the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof, other than (A) developments or changes in the animal health industry generally, (B) changes, in and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of the shares of Company Common Stock, (C) developments or changes resulting from any COVID-19 Measures or (D) the fact that, in and of itself, the Company exceeds any internal or published industry analyst projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings (any such material change, event, fact, development or occurrence, an “Intervening Event”) or, if in any case the Company Board of Directors has determined, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, after considering any amendments offered by Parent during the period contemplated by Section 6.2(e)(ii), that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.   (e)               Prior to the Company making any Change of Recommendation or (to the extent applicable) terminating this Agreement as permitted:   (i)                 Under Section 6.2(d)(i), the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business days’ prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action, including copies of the proposed definitive agreement, all ancillary agreements, and all written communications providing other terms (and, if oral, a summary of the material terms of such communications) relating to such Acquisition Proposal or, if such documents and written communications are not available to the Company, specifying in writing the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal. During such four (4) business day period, the Company shall negotiate in good faith Parent (and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate in good faith) (in each case, to the extent Parent desires to negotiate and makes its Representatives available for such purposes) to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. The provisions under this Section 6.2(e)(i) shall also apply with respect to any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal (except that any reference to four (4) business days shall instead be three (3) business days) or any successive Acquisition Proposals.   (ii)              Under Section 6.2(d)(ii), the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business days’ prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and specifying, in writing and in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and during such four (4) business day period, the Company shall negotiate in good faith Parent (and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate in good faith) (in each case, to the extent Parent desires to negotiate and makes its Representatives available for such purposes) to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement to obviate the requirement to make a Change of Recommendation. The provisions under this Section 6.2(e)(ii) shall also apply with respect to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change of Recommendation (except that any reference to four (4) business days shall instead be three (3) business days); provided that, no such three (3) business day period shall be required if such three (3) business day period would commence within five (5) business days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (taking into account any adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting required by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(1)) unless any such three (3) business day period is the first three (3) business day period under this Section 6.2(e)(ii) with respect to an Intervening Event (in which case such three (3) business day period shall commence).

  (f)                Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) issuing a “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e- 2(a), or making a statement contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company’s stockholders if (with respect to this clause (ii) only) the Company Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ duties under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, any “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself constitute a Change of Recommendation; provided that this Section 6.2(f) shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation, except to the extent permitted by Section 6.2(d) or Section 6.2(e).

Subject to a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.2(d), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Vote.

(iii)            If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h), then, concurrently with such termination of this Agreement by the Company as set forth in Section 9.1(h) (or, if later, promptly following the provision by Parent of wire transfer instructions pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(iv)), the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

ARTICLE X   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 10.1.      Amendment and Modification; Waiver.   (a)               Subject to applicable Law and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented by written agreement of the Parties (by action taken by their respective boards of directors); provided that, after the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if any such amendment shall by applicable Law requires further approval of the holders of Company Shares, the effectiveness of such amendment shall be subject to the approval of the holders of Company Shares.

(b)               At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to Parent or the Company contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of any Parent, Merger Sub or the Company contained herein.

This Section 10.2 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties (or of any other party to any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement) which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The word “or” shall not be exclusive. “Extent” in the phrase “to the extent” means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply “if.” References to “dollars” or “$” are to United States of America dollars. References (a) to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as amended from time to time and to any rules, regulations or interpretations promulgated thereunder, (b) to any Contract are to that Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; provided that with respect to any Contract listed on any schedules hereto, all such amendments, modifications or supplements must also be listed in the appropriate schedule, (c) to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of that Person, (d) from or through any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or through and including, respectively, and (e) to the “date hereof” means the date of this Agreement. The table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision hereof. When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.   Section 10.7.      Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed (including by means of electronic signature) in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by email (in .pdf or .tiff format) shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.   Section 10.8.      Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries.    (a)               This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes referred to herein), the Support Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.   (b)               Except (i) as provided in Section 7.5 and (ii) for the rights of holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards to receive the payments provided for in Article III, neither this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes referred to herein) nor the Confidentiality Agreement are intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. The representations and warranties contained herein are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 10.1 without notice or liability to any other Person.   Section 10.9.      Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.   Section 10.10.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction.   (a)               This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, and all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions shall be resolved under, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in

Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 10.10(b) in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.5.

Section 10.13.  Enforcement; Remedies.    (a)               Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.   (b)               The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur and that remedies at law would not be adequate in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached.

(c)               The Parties’ rights in this Section 10.13 are an integral part of the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 10.13 (including any objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity).   Each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this Section 10.13, such Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

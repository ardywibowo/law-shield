Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall consummate the Merger and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”) and, from and after the Merger, the Company shall be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.   2.2            Effective Time; Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Article 8, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place (a) at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP, at 3570 Carmel Mountain Road, Suite 200, San Diego, California, or by exchange of documents (with signatures) by electronic transmission, no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the day on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) has been satisfied or waived (and all such conditions remain satisfied or waived on such Business Day) in accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such other time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, that Parent shall not be required to consummate the Closing prior to the date that is 30 Business Days after the date hereof. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date.” Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the “Certificate of Merger”) shall be duly executed by the Company and simultaneously with the Closing shall be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the date and time of such filing, or such later time as shall be agreed by Parent and the Company and specified in such filing, being the “Effective Time”).   2.3            Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

________________


Effective Time to be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, until thereafter amended as provided by law and such certificate of incorporation.   (b)           Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.   2.5           Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and, except as determined by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.   2.6           Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   (a)           Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled or to remain outstanding pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash, net of applicable withholding taxes and without interest, equal to the fourteen U.S. dollars ($14.00) (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”) payable to the holder of such Company Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.9. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Company Shares with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such for all purposes of this Article 2.   (b)           Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made and no consideration of any kind shall be delivered with respect thereto. Each Company Share held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company shall remain outstanding and shall not be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.   


13    


  (c)           Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   2.7           Company Stock Options; Company RSUs.   (a)            Except as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of Company Stock Options, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Company Stock Options, each outstanding Company Stock Option (or any portion thereof), whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such option by (y) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Stock Option, less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by law to be withheld in respect of such payment (such amount, the “Option Payment”). Option Payments to employees and former employees of the Company shall be remitted through the payroll system of the Company or Parent. Option Payments to all other persons shall be remitted through the Company’s or Parent’s accounts payable or (with the consent of the Paying Agent) through the Paying Agent.   (b)           Except as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of Company RSUs, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Company RSUs, each Company RSU (or any portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Company RSUs which are subject to performance conditions that have not been satisfied at the Effective Time, which shall be deemed satisfied in accordance with (and to the extent provided by) the terms of the Company Stock Plans and applicable award agreements in connection with the Merger, as defined herein) shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time (or, to the extent required in order to avoid the holder becoming subject to any tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the earliest payment date provided for in the terms and conditions of the Company RSU) an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company RSU, less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by Law to be withheld in respect of such payment (such amount, the “RSU Payment”). If the RSU Payment cannot be made as soon as practicable after the Effective Time without triggering any tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall provide to the Parent prior to the Effective Time a written schedule specifically identifying the applicable payment date for each such Company RSU that complies with the payment rules under Section 409A of the Code. RSU Payments to employees and former employees of the Company shall be remitted through the payroll system of the Company or Parent. RSU Payments to all other persons shall be remitted through the Company’s or Parent’s accounts payable or (with the consent of the Paying Agent) through the Paying Agent.   


14    


  (c)            Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall to the extent and in the manner required by the applicable Company Stock Plan provide notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding award granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan describing the treatment of such award in accordance with this Section 2.7 and the Company Stock Plans. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause there to be taken, as the case may be) such actions, shall obtain such consents, adopt (or cause there to be adopted) any amendments of any Company Stock Plan and any awards thereunder, as may be necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.7.   2.8           Dissenting Shares.   (a)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by the stockholders of the Company who are entitled to demand appraisal and who shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (collectively, “Dissenting Company Shares”) shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Such stockholders of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares








________________


held by the stockholders of the Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, net of applicable withholding taxes and without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.9.   (b)            The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.   


15    


  2.9           Surrender of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books.   (a)            Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”), which shall provide for the payment by the Paying Agent of the amounts payable under Section 2.6(a) in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.9. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 2.6(a); provided that Parent shall not be required to make available to the Paying Agent any Per Share Merger Consideration for Dissenting Company Shares until such time as any holders thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Article 2, and to the extent that there are net losses with respect to any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses, which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to Parent. The Surviving Corporation shall bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the payment of funds to holders of Company Shares.   (b)            Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”) and to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of book-entry shares representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Book-Entry Shares”), in each case whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a), (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book- Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or book-entry entitle such holder to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates, Book-Entry Shares and transferred unregistered Company Common Stock upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal and reasonable exchange practices.   


16    


  (c)            The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.   (d)            Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or one of its affiliates, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, as general creditors thereof) for payment of their claim for Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.   (e)            None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the earlier of (i) two years after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior to the date on which the Per Share Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such Per Share Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (f)            If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming








________________


such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, subject to such person’s compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in Section 2.9(b) (other than the surrender of a Certificate), issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate in accordance with this Article 2.   


17    


  2.10         Withholding Rights. Each of Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation the Paying Agent, and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any person under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   2.11         Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or (ii) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.   2.12         Treatment of Convertible Notes .   (a)            In accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture, at or after the Effective Time, each holder of Convertible Notes will be entitled, subject to the terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes Indenture, to:   (i)            convert such holder’s Convertible Notes only into a right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of such Convertible Notes held by such holder equal to the (i) Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the Conversion Rate (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture and as may be increased by any Additional Shares (as defined in the relevant Convertible Notes Indenture)) in effect on the applicable Conversion Date (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes Indenture);   (ii)           require the Surviving Corporation to repurchase such holder’s Convertible Notes (or any portion of principal amount thereof that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof), for cash on a date specified by the Company in accordance with the Convertible Notes Indenture at the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture); or   (iii)          continue to hold such holder’s Convertible Notes, which, for the avoidance of doubt, following the Effective Time shall only be convertible or exchangeable into cash as set forth in Section 2.12(a)(i) above.   (b)           The Surviving Corporation shall satisfy and fulfill the relevant payment obligations to each holder of Convertible Notes described in Section 2.12(a) above as and when required by the terms of this Agreement and the Convertible Notes Indenture (as such Convertible Notes Indenture may be supplemented in accordance with its terms and Section 6.17(a)).

  3.            Representations and Warranties of the Company.   Except as disclosed in a document of even date herewith delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and referring by section or sub-section number to the representations and warranties in this Agreement (the “Disclosure Schedule”), (provided that an item disclosed in any Section shall be deemed to have been disclosed for each other Section of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure) and except as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the Company with, or furnished by the Company to, the SEC after January 1, 2018 and publicly available no less than three (3) business days prior to the date of this Agreement (but excluding any risk factor disclosure under the headings “Risk Factors” or “Forward Looking Statements”) (provided that nothing disclosed in any such Company filing with the SEC shall be deemed to be a qualification or modification of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.3, 3.7(a) or 3.8(b)), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   3.1           Organization and Qualification; Company Subsidiaries.

The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where such failure, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

All such amounts payable under the Company Arrangements have been or are being paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto). The adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each Company Arrangement has been approved as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d–10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and the “safe harbor” provided pursuant to Rule 14d–10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the execution of this Agreement of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the “Company Compensation Committee”) or its independent directors. A true and complete copy of any resolutions of any committee of the Company Board reflecting any approvals and actions referred to in the preceding sentence and taken prior to the date of this Agreement has been made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement.

Except as would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date consummation of the Merger and as, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any material alterations, additions or improvements to the Company Leased Real Property that are required to be removed (or of which any landlord, sublandlord or licensee could require removal) at the termination or expiration of the applicable Real Property Lease. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice of any condemnation, expropriation or other proceeding in eminent domain affecting the Company Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein, and to the knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings are threatened or proposed.

Except as set forth in Section 3.13(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted to any other person any rights to use, occupy or possess any part of the Company Leased Real Property.

No Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party will cause or require (or purports to cause or require) the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their affiliates to (i) grant to any Third Party any license, covenant not to sue, immunity or other right with respect to or under any Intellectual Property Rights of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or such affiliates; or (ii) be obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts, or offer any discounts, to any Third Party (except, in each of (i) and (ii), with respect to Surviving Corporation only, royalties, other amounts, discounts, licenses, covenants not to sue, immunities or other rights that Company or Surviving Corporation would have had to pay, offer or grant had this Agreement not been entered into and the Transactions not been consummated).

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to the Company on the date of this Agreement and referring by section or subsection number to the representations and warranties in this Agreement, provided that an item disclosed in any Section shall be deemed to have been disclosed for each other Section of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure, Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company that:   4.1           Corporate Organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Merger Sub from performing any of their material obligations under this Agreement.   4.2           Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors’ rights generally, and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

(b)           The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval, waiting period termination or expiration, authorization or permit of, or filing with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of (x) the Exchange Act and Blue Sky Laws, (y) the HSR Act and similar requirements in foreign countries where a merger filing will be necessary, and (z) the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, waiting period expirations or terminations, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions beyond the Outside Date or otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing their material obligations under this Agreement.   4.4           Financing.   (a)           Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete copy of (i) the executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and among Merger Sub and the Lenders, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto and the executed fee letter associated therewith redacted in a manner as described below (collectively, as amended, restated, replaced, substituted, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in accordance with Section 6.15(b) or, in the case of an Alternative Financing, in accordance with Section 6.15(c), the “Debt Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Merger Sub for the purpose of funding the Merger and the other Transactions (the “Debt Financing”), and (ii) an executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and among Parent and Sponsor, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (the “Equity Commitment Letter” and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the “Commitment Letters”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, Sponsor has committed to provide the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding a portion of the Merger (such committed equity financing, the “Equity Financing” and, together with the Debt Financing, the “Financing”).   


52   


  (b)          As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters (i) are in full force and effect, (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or (iii) have not been amended or modified in any respect and each of the Commitment Letters, in the form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against it or Merger Sub, as applicable, or, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally, and general equitable principles. Except for the fee letter referred to above (a true, accurate and complete copy of which has been provided to the Company with only the fee amounts, economic terms contained in any “flex” provisions, pricing caps and other economic terms contained therein redacted with no such redaction covering terms that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing) and non- disclosure agreements, the Commitment Letters are the only agreements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to funding or investing, as applicable of the Financing as of the date of this Agreement.

The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third-party beneficiary in connection with Company’s exercise of its rights under Section 9.6, and that Parent agrees not to oppose the grant of an injunction, specific performance or other equity relief in connection with the exercise of such third party rights.   (c)          As of the date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, under any term of the Commitment Letters and (ii) assuming the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, Parent (x) has no reason (both before and after giving effect to any “flex” provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) to believe that any of the conditions applicable to it in the Commitment Letters will not be satisfied on the Closing Date and (y) knows of no fact, occurrence, circumstance or condition that would reasonably be expected to cause any Commitment Letter to be terminated, withdrawn, modified, repudiated or rescinded or to be or become unenforceable or otherwise cause the full amount (or any portion) of the funds contemplated to be available under the Commitment Letters to not be available to Merger Sub or Parent, as applicable, on the Closing Date.   (d)          Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the Financing is funded and/or invested in accordance with the Commitment Letters, Parent will have, in the aggregate and together with the available cash and cash equivalents of the Company, sufficient funds to pay the Per Share Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including any amounts payable in respect of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs under this Agreement) and all associated fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions, including the Financing, in each case, to the extent required to be paid on the Closing Date (collectively, the “Required Amount”).   (e)          As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i) awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Transactions or (ii) expressly prohibiting any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions.

As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any subsidiary of Parent nor any property or asset of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is subject to any material continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that is reasonably likely to prevent consummation of the Merger beyond the Outside Date or otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing their material obligations under this Agreement.   4.6           Merger Sub. All of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned directly by Parent or a direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent.

(a)           Upon reasonable prior notice, from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, afford the officers, employees and other Representatives of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable access at all reasonable times to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities, books and records of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, including the Owned Company Intellectual Property, and shall furnish to officers, employees and other Representatives of Parent and Merger Sub with such financial, operating and other data and information (including the work papers of the Company’s accountants) as Parent or Merger Sub, through their officers, employees and other Representatives, may reasonably request as long as these actions are in compliance with all applicable data privacy/protection Laws and antitrust Laws; provided, that such disclosure shall not be required to include any information that is subject to a statutory non-disclosure or similar provision or agreement with a Governmental Authority, prime contractor, higher-tier subcontractor, distributor, or other third party for end-use by a Governmental Authority (collectively, “Governmental Contracting Parties”), or that is subject to an attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege, or that is subject to a non-disclosure agreement with a third party. If requested by Parent, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to secure the consent of the appropriate Governmental Contracting Party or other third party to permit disclosure of such protected information to Parent and Merger Sub or to redact such protected information to the extent necessary to address reasonable privilege and confidentiality concerns.   (b)           All information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall be held confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement between Digital Colony Acquisitions, LLC and the Company, dated as of February 18, 2020, as amended on January 28, 2021 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”); provided, that the definition of “Representatives” in the paragraph 12(a) of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to include any potential debt or equity financing sources or co-investors of Parent or Merger Sub (it being understood that notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives may disclose any information to such potential debt or equity financing sources or co-investors, subject to receipt of customary confidentiality undertakings from such potential debt or equity financing sources or co- investors).   (c)           To the extent consistent with applicable Law, the Company shall consult with Parent in good faith on a regular basis as reasonably requested by Parent to report material (individually or in the aggregate) operational developments, the pursuit of additional Company Material Contracts with customers, the status of relationships with customers and potential customers, the status of ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent, including the continued accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties and compliance with the Company’s covenants and obligations under this Agreement.   (d)           The Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary in its reasonable judgment to comply with applicable Law, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided under this Section 6.1 as “outside counsel only.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the

  6.2           Solicitation of Transactions.   (a)           Go-Shop Period. During the period (the “Go-Shop Period”) commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York city time) on April 2, 2021, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the Representatives shall have the right to (i) initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, including by furnishing information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to any person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into by such person; provided that the Company shall, to the extent not previously provided to Merger Sub or Parent, provide or make available to Merger Sub or Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided or made available to any person prior to or substantially concurrently to providing such information to such person and (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any persons or group of persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposals and cooperate with or assist or participate in or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition Proposal.   (b)           No-Shop Period.   (i)            From and after the Go-Shop Period, and continuing until prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, or if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they authorize or permit and shall instruct and cause any of their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, except as otherwise permitted by this Section 6.2, (a) solicit, initiate, knowingly induce, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or the making thereof to the Company or its stockholders; (b) enter into, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide access to its properties, books and records or furnish any confidential or non-public information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives) in connection with, relating to, or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating an Acquisition Proposal; (c) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (d) execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement; or (e) take any action to render any provision of any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “business combination” or other similar anti-takeover statute (including Section 203 of the DCGL) or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company’s organizational documents, in each case inapplicable to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) or any Acquisition Proposal (and to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted to any such person or Acquisition Proposal under any such provisions). Any violation of the restrictions on the Company or any Company Subsidiary set forth in this Section 6.2(b)(i) by any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.2(b)(i) by the Company. Promptly following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall instruct and cause any of their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations or other activities with any person (other than the parties hereto) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will thereafter promptly request each person (other than the parties hereto) that has, prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such person by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the date hereof and shall terminate access to data rooms furnished in connection therewith.   


 60    


  (ii)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in breach of Section 6.2(b)(i) (except to the extent solicited in accordance with Section 6.2(a)) that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 6.2, (x) furnish information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or promptly following the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal, but only if and to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may, solely to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, not enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party for the sole purpose of allowing the other party to such agreement to submit an Acquisition Proposal that will constitute, or could reasonably likely lead to, a Superior Proposal, that did not, in each case, result from a breach by the Company of Section 6.2(b)(i).   (iii)          For purposes of this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a Third Party that, if consummated, would result in such Third Party’s (or its stockholders’) owning, directly or indirectly, greater than 50% of the equity securities of the Company (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or greater than 50% of the assets of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Company Board) and that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel (x) if consummated, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company’s stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the Merger, taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise and (y) after taking into account all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement, is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed.

termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (x) (A) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions (the “Company Board Recommendation”), (B) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the Company Common Stock within ten (10) business days of the commencement of such offer, (C) fail to reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer or public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after written request from Parent to do so, (D) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (F) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract constituting or related to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (any of the foregoing, an “Acquisition Agreement”) (any of the foregoing in clauses (A)-(F), a “Change in Recommendation”).   (ii)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained if an event, fact, development, circumstance or occurrence that affects or would be reasonably likely to affect the business, assets or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that was not known to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, but becomes known by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained (an “ Intervening Event”), effect a Change in Recommendation of the type in clause (A) or clause (E) of Change in Recommendation; provided, however, that the Company Board may not effect a Change in Recommendation of the type in clause (A) or clause (E) of Change in Recommendation due to an Intervening Event unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days in advance of its intention to take such action, and prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such five (5) business day period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Change in Recommendation is no longer necessary (and in the event of any material change to the circumstances related to the Intervening Event that is adverse to the stockholders of the Company, the Company shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in this proviso and a renewed negotiation period under this proviso shall commence (except that the five (5) business day period shall instead be equal to three (3) business days; provided that if such additional notice is delivered during the initial five (5) business day negotiation period, the initial negotiation period shall not be reduced by such notice)); and provided, further, that the Company Board shall not be permitted to effect a Change in Recommendation of the type in clause (A) or clause (E) of Change in Recommendation pursuant to this Section 6.2(c)(ii) with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal (which shall be covered by and subject in all respects to Section 6.2(c)(iii)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall (i) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any other acquisition of assets or businesses from the Company or any matter relating thereto or consequent thereof or (ii) any event or circumstance resulting from (A) the announcement, pendency and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, (B) any actions required to be taken or to be refrained from being taken pursuant to this Agreement, or (C) any breach of this Agreement by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an Intervening Event.  


 62   


 (iii)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company Board may in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of Section 6.2(b)(i), (A) make a Change in Recommendation (other than the type in clause (F) of Change in Recommendation) if the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that failure to make such Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and concurrently with such termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that failure to so terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may not effect a Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) business days in advance of its intention to take such action (a “Notice of Designated Superior Proposal”), and prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation or termination of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such five (5) business day period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Change in Recommendation is no longer necessary and such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal (and in the event of any material change to any of the terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) of such Superior Proposal the Company, the Company shall, in each case, deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in this proviso and a renewed negotiation period under this proviso shall commence (except that the five (5) business day period shall instead be equal to three (3) business days; provided that if such additional notice is delivered during the initial five (5) business day negotiation period, the initial negotiation period shall not be reduced by such notice)); provided further, that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays by wire transfer of immediately available funds the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.1(f).  


 63   


  (d)            The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt any request for information or other inquiry which the Company could reasonably expect to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and attaching a copy of any such written Acquisition Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to the Company, the Company shall summarize in writing the terms of such Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt any such request or other inquiry), except (and solely to the extent) such notification and/or disclosure is prohibited by the terms of a confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party as of the date of this Agreement and thereafter shall (i) keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours of the occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of any material developments regarding any Acquisition Proposals or any change to the terms and status of any such Acquisition Proposal or the process associated with such proposals or offers and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all material correspondence and other substantive written material sent or provided to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries from any person that described any of the terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.   (e)            Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under








________________


Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or under Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (including making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the stockholders); provided, that this Section 6.2(e) shall not be deemed to affect whether any such disclosure, other than a “stop, look and listen” communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, would otherwise be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation. For clarity, a factually accurate public statement that describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, that no position has been taken by the Company Board as to the advisability or desirability of such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed a Change in Recommendation.   (f)            Proxy Filing; Information Supplied.   (i)            The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event within five Business Days after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the “Proxy Statement”). The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information included by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.2(c), the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation and, unless there has been a Change in Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.2(c), the Company will continue to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company Vote including the solicitation of proxies therefor.   


 64   


  (ii)            The Company will provide Parent and its legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement and other documents related to the Stockholders Meeting prior to filing such documents with the applicable Governmental Authority and mailing such documents to the Company’s stockholders. The Company will consider in good faith for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and such other documents related to the Stockholders Meeting all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by Parent or its legal counsel and the Company agrees that all information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries included in the Proxy Statement shall be in form and content satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting or filed with the SEC (as applicable) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and (B) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates assume no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by a party, which information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that either the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and the Company shall prepare (with the assistance of Parent) and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law.   (iii)            The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.2(f), will (i) promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, (ii) provide Parent, its financial advisors and legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the Company’s proposed response to such comments, (iii) consider in good faith any comments proposed by Parent, its financial advisors and legal counsel and (iv) provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings with the SEC (or portions of any such meetings that relate to the Proxy Statement). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC, and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.   


 65   


  (g)            Stockholders Meeting.   (i)            The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the “Stockholders Meeting”) as promptly as practicable and in any event on the thirtieth calendar day immediately following the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (and if such day is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day subsequent to such day), to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and to cause such vote to be taken, and shall not postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by applicable Law and with prior notice to Parent or, if, (i) on a date that is two Business Days prior to the date the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (the “Original Date”), (A) the Company has not received proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or (B) it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is required to be delivered and in each case, if Parent so requests or the Company so elects, the Company shall postpone, recess or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements, recesses or adjournments of, the Stockholders Meeting as long as the date of the Stockholders Meeting is not postponed, recessed or adjourned more than ten days in connection with any one postponement, recess or adjournment or more than an aggregate of thirty days from the Original Date in reliance on the preceding sentence or (ii) within the five Business Days prior to the Original Date or any date that the Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, the Company delivers a notice of an intent to make a Change in Recommendation, Parent may direct the Company to, or the Company may elect to, postpone, recess or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting for up to ten Business Days and the Company shall promptly, and in any event no later than the next Business Day, postpone, recess or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Parent’s direction or such election.   (ii)            Once the Company has established a record date for the Stockholders Meeting, the Company will not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and, to the extent required by the terms of this Agreement, the Company has paid to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(a), its obligations to








________________


hold the Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall not be affected in any manner, including in connection with (i) the making of a Change in Recommendation by the Company Board or (ii) the commencement of or announcement or disclosure of or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal.   


 66   


  (iii)            The Company agrees to provide Parent reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested, promptly providing daily voting reports). Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement will be the only matter (other than related procedural matters) that the Company will propose to be acted on by the Company’s stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting.   6.3           Employee Benefits Matters.   (a)            If so directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board will adopt (and will cause any other sponsor of the applicable Company Benefit Plan to adopt), at least five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time, resolutions terminating any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and the Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of the Company Subsidiaries or any other applicable Company Benefit Plan sponsor, as applicable. The Company shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request.   (b)            As of the Effective Time, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and/or their respective subsidiaries shall provide the Continuing Employees with substantially comparable types and levels of employee benefits in the aggregate as those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (such benefits to be provided pursuant to the “Parent Plans”), provided that this undertaking shall not obligate Parent to continue the employment of such Continuing Employees for any period following the Effective Time, and such Continuing Employees may be terminated by Parent at any time (except to the extent otherwise restricted by Law and subject to any contractual arrangements between the Company and any individual employee, as in effect on the date hereof).   (c)            For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or frozen benefit plan of Parent or vesting under any equity incentive plan) under any Parent Plan, Parent will credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Company before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, Parent will, subject in each case to receipt of any required consent of the applicable Parent Plan provider, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Parent Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively- at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plan.   


 67   


  (d)            Parent will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms the executive agreements listed on Section 6.3(d) of the Disclosure Schedule following the Effective Time.   (e)            Each Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Company’s Management Incentive Compensation Plan shall remain eligible to receive a cash bonus for the fiscal year 2021. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the employment of any Continuing Employee who participates in the Company’s Management Incentive Compensation Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date is terminated other than for cause by the Surviving Corporation, or an affiliate thereof, following the Closing Date but prior to the date of payment of bonuses under the Company’s Management Incentive Compensation Plan for fiscal year 2021 in the ordinary course in accordance with the terms thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay a cash bonus to such Continuing Employee equal to a prorated portion of such Continuing Employee’s annual target bonus in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable deductions and withholdings.   (f)            Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in any respect, including in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment), or create any such rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan or any employee or service provider program or arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any Company Benefit Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time), or (y) constitute or be construed to constitute an amendment to any of the compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to employees or other persons prior to or following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate any such plans or arrangements of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any Company Benefit Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time).   (g)            If the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any Company Arrangement, all such amounts payable under such Company Arrangement shall be paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto). Moreover, the Company shall take all actions necessary so that, prior to the Effective Time: (i) the adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each such Company Arrangement shall be approved as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d–10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and (ii) the “safe harbor” provided pursuant to Rule 14d–10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the Effective Time of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the Company Compensation Committee or its independent directors.

  6.4           Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.   (a)            For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification, exculpation or advance of expense or similar agreement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in favor of any Indemnified Person (the “Indemnification Agreements”) and any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses provisions under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) as in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law.   (b)            Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and for six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide officers’ and directors’ liability, fiduciary liability and similar insurance (collectively, “D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Company’s D&O Insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.4(b), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in the aggregate in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement and is set forth on Section 6.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (provided, that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most advantageous policies available for an annual premium equal to such amount). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, and prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may, with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (and at the request of Parent, shall) purchase a “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, covering the same persons and providing the same terms with respect to coverage and premium amount as aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the sixth annual anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the purchase of such insurance Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.4(b) shall be deemed satisfied for so long as such insurance is in full force and effect and covers the matters that would otherwise be covered pursuant to this Section 6.4(b).   (c)            The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.4 shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which each Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.4 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this Section 6.4 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by an Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.4.

  (d)            If (1) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or (2) Parent or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.   6.5           Anti-Takeover Statutes. In the event that any “moratorium,”, “control share acquisition,” fair price,” “business combination” or other state anti-takeover or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, the Company and Company Board shall grant such reasonable approval and take such reasonable action as necessary so that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement and the Transactions.   6.6           Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub in writing (and shall subsequently keep Parent and Merger Sub informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) of: (i) any representation or warranty made by the Company contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in clause (iii)(c) of Annex A would not be satisfied or (x) any failure of the Company to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in clause (iii)(d) of Annex A would not be satisfied; (ii) the occurrence or existence of any Effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any written notice or other written communication received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary from any person alleging that the consent, approval, permission of or waiver from such party is required in connection with the Transactions. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company in writing (and shall subsequently keep the Company informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the failure to so comply or the becoming untrue or incorrect would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing their material obligations under this Agreement or of any written notice or other written communication received by Parent or Merger Sub from any person alleging that the consent, approval, permission of or waiver from such party is required in connection with the Transactions. For clarity, unintentional failure to give notice under this Section 6.6 shall not be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this Section 6.6 and shall constitute only a breach of the underlying representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as the case may be.   


 70   


  6.7           Litigation. Until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of any Action that shall be instituted or threatened in writing against the Company, any Company Subsidiary and/or their directors to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of or seek damages in connection with this Agreement or any Transactions. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of any new Action that is instituted or threatened in writing against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that would have been listed in Section 3.9 of the Disclosure Schedule, if such Action had arisen prior to the date hereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at Parent’s expense in (but not control) the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation or claims against the Company or any of its directors relating to the Merger, in each case which seek to prohibit or restrain the Transactions. The Company shall not settle or make an offer to settle any litigation against the Company or any director relating to this Agreement, the Merger, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).   6.8           Consents and Approvals.

Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other in connection with the making of all such filings or responses. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any applicable law, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to attend any meeting, communication, or conference with any Governmental Authority in connection with such proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other antitrust Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the other (or the other’s respective advisors) copies of all correspondence between such party and any Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 6.9 as "outside counsel only.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to this Section 6.9, or whenever a Governmental Authority requests information or documents related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence or request and cooperate in filing or producing promptly with the applicable Governmental Authority such amendment, supplement, information or documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to the other (or the other’s respective advisors) copies of all correspondence between such Party and any Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 6.9 as “outside counsel only.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall include representatives of both parties. Subject to applicable Law, the parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by or on behalf of any Party.

  6.10        Rule 16b-3 . Prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company shall take such actions as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.7 and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   6.11        Delisting.

  (b)          Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement, termination, modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of, any condition, remedy or other provision under any Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, supplement, termination, modification, replacement or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing from that contemplated by the Commitment Letters delivered as of the date hereof to an amount less than that required to pay the Required Amount unless the Equity Financing, Debt Financing, Alternative Financing permitted in accordance herewith or cash on hand of Merger Sub is increased by a corresponding amount, (ii) impose any new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would (x) materially delay (taking in to account the expected timing of the Closing contemplated by Section 2.2) or prevent the Closing from occurring or (y) make the funding of any portion of the Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of the Financing) on the Closing Date materially less likely to occur or (iii) adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable,  or, in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter, the Company, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters (it being understood and agreed that, in any event, Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement). Upon any such amendment, supplement, modification, termination or replacement of, or waiver of, any Commitment Letter or other modification to any of the Financing not prohibited by this Section 6.15(b), Parent shall promptly deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references herein to “Commitment Letters” shall include and mean such documents as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this Section 6.15(b), and references to “Financing” shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this Section 6.15(b), as applicable.   (c)          In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter for any reason, (i) Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall promptly notify the Company and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative financing from the same or alternative sources (the “Alternative Financing”) in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing and cash on hand of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is and remains available to Parent and Merger Sub, to fund the Required Amount; provided, that Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall not be required to, and in no event shall its reasonable best efforts be deemed or construed to require that it, (A) obtain Alternative Financing (1) on terms and conditions that are less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any “flex” provisions) as in effect on the date hereof, (2) includes any conditions to funding of the Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (3) would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) pay any fees or agree to pay any interest rate amounts or original issue discounts, in either case, in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof (including any “flex” provisions) or to consummate the Debt Financing prior to the date as is required pursuant to Section 2 or (C) seek or obtain equity financing in excess of the amount provided for in, or from a Person other than the counterparties to, the Equity Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof. In the event any Alternative Financing is obtained and a debt commitment letter is entered into with respect thereto, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references herein to (A) “Debt Commitment Letter” and the “Commitment Letters” shall be deemed to include and mean the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by such debt commitment letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and such debt commitment letter to the extent then in effect, and (B) “Financing” shall include such Alternative Financing.   


76   


  (d)          Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall furnish the Company true and complete and executed (upon execution) copies of the Financing Agreements upon the prior reasonable written request of the Company. Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall (i) give the Company prompt written notice of any default or breach by any party to any of the Commitment Letters of which Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, becomes aware, if such default or breach would result in a delay of, or in any way limit, the availability of the Financing and (ii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall give the Company prompt notice (A) of the receipt or delivery of any notice or other written communication, in each case from any person with respect to (x) any actual default under or breach of any provisions of the Commitment Letters by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, or any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission of any provisions thereof by any party to any of the Commitment Letters or (y) any material dispute or material disagreement between or among parties to any of the Commitment Letters with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing Date in each case, that would make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or materially delay the availability of the Financing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing), and (B) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the Commitment Letters. Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall promptly provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence   6.16        Financing Cooperation.

Such cooperation by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall include:   (i)           preparing and furnishing Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and the Debt Financing Sources, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and in any event, not later than a time reasonably sufficient to allow Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to satisfy any condition to the receipt of such Debt Financing, including in any event on or prior to the Closing Date), all Financial Information and all other financial and other pertinent information and disclosures regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, for use in connection with the Debt Financing,

For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that the none of the foregoing nor anything else contained in this Agreement is intended to limit Parent and Merger Sub’s right to seek monetary damages from the Company in the event of the Company’s willful and material breach of this Agreement in circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not payable.

  (f)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Company’s right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3, in circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable, plus, if applicable, the Enforcement Costs shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law or otherwise) of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties or any Debt Financing Source and any person who pays the Parent Termination Fee on Parent’s behalf for all any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements), judgments, inquiries and fines suffered in respect of this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith (including with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Financing Agreements, the Equity Commitment Letters and the Limited Guaranty) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including in respect of any breach, whether or not willful or intentional, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated) or the Transactions in such circumstances and none of the Parent Related Parties (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Limited Guaranty), and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if due, to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any Debt Financing Source shall have any further liability or obligation to any of the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. No Company Related Party shall be entitled to, and the Company shall not and shall cause any Company Related Party not to bring or maintain any Action against any Parent Related Party (other than Parent, Merger Sub or Sponsor to the extent set forth in the Limited Guaranty) or any Debt Financing Source arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith (including with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Financing Agreements, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guaranty) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Action pending in connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith (including with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Financing Agreements, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guaranty) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to the extent maintained by the Company or any Company Related Party against Parent, Merger Sub, Sponsors, or any Debt Financing Source to be dismissed with prejudice promptly following the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if due, or the final and non-appealable determination that no such payment is due. For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum aggregate monetary liability of any Parent Related Party, if any, shall be limited to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee and under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (x) a grant of specific performance of the funding of the Equity Financing or the obligation to close contemplated by Section 10.6 and (y) any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that the none of the foregoing nor anything else contained in this Agreement is intended to limit the Company’s right to seek monetary damages from Parent or Merger Sub in the event of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s willful and material breach of this Agreement in circumstances

9.4          Entire Agreement; Assignment; No Other Representations or Warranties. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (other than Section 6 thereof) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof (including Section 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement). This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except that (a) Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent so long as Parent and Merger Sub remain liable for all of the obligations contemplated under this Agreement and (b) Parent and Merger Sub (and following the Closing Date, the Company) may at any time, and without the consent of any other person or party, unilaterally grant a security interest in, and assign for collateral security purposes, its rights and interests hereunder to the Debt Financing Sources (or their agent) providing Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documentation with respect thereto. Except for the representations and warranties contained in Section 3, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any person on behalf of the Company makes, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any person on their behalf relies upon, any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions. In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plans and cost- related plan information, regarding the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business plans and cost-related plans, furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans), and that neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, or any other person, with respect thereto except for any information set forth in the representations and warranties contained in Article 3 of this Agreement. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other person, has made or is making any representation or warranty or has or shall have any liability (whether pursuant to this Agreement, in tort or otherwise) with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans), except as may be expressly set forth in Article 3 of this Agreement.   9.5          Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (i) following the Closing Date, the rights of holders of Company Shares to receive payment for the Company Shares converted into cash pursuant to the Merger and the rights of holders of Company Stock Options and other convertible securities to receive payment pursuant to Section 2.7 and Section 2.12, (ii)  Section 6.4 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons), (iii) Section 8.3(f) (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Parent Related Parties and may be enforced by such persons), (iv) Section 8.3(e) (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Company Related Parties and may be enforced by such persons and (v) Section 9.13 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons); provided, however, that the Debt Financing Sources may enforce (and each is an intended third party beneficiary of) the provisions of Section 8.3(f), this Section 9.5, Section 9.7(b), Section 9.8, Section 9.10, Section 9.13 and Section 9.14, in each case, that are related to such Debt Financing Sources.   


91   


  9.6          Specific Performance.   (a)            The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity, and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to injunctive relief or specific performance. It is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter in order to fund the Merger (including, without limitation, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with, and subject to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter, in order cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter). Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.   (b)            The right to specific enforcement hereunder shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of parties to this Agreement further agrees that no other party or any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.6, and each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Each of the parties to this Agreement agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at Law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at equity or Law, or any similar grounds.   


92   


  (c)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Per Share Merger Consideration and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the consummation of the Closing (but not the right of the Company to obtain such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i) all conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, as applicable, have been and continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or waived at the Closing Date; (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded (or will concurrently be) funded in full in accordance with the terms thereof, or the Debt Financing Sources have irrevocably confirmed in writing to the parties hereto that the Debt Financing will be funded in full at or before the Closing Date if the Equity Financing is funded at or before the Closing Date (provided, that the Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to draw down the Equity Financing or consummate the Closing if the Debt Financing is not in fact funded at or before the Closing Date); and (iii)  the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (A) if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing were funded,

then, then it will take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing or the consummation of the Closing, as applicable, to occur (and the Company has not revoked, withdrawn, modified or conditioned such confirmation) and (B) the Company is prepared, willing and able to effect the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   9.7          Governing Law.   (a)            This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any applicable conflicts of law.

The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any right or obligation with respect to any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and any claim, controversy, dispute, suit, action or proceeding relating thereto or arising thereunder, shall be governed by, construed and interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of New York.   9.8          Waiver of Jury Trial . EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR ARISING UNDER THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, THE DEBT FINANCING CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.8.

FOURTH: The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shares shall be common stock having a par value per share of $0.001.   FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this certificate of incorporation, bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the board of directors of the Corporation, but any bylaws adopted by the board of directors may be amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon. Election of directors need not be by written ballot.   SIXTH: (a) To the maximum extent permitted by the DGCL, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article SIXTH to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended, automatically and without further action, upon the date of such amendment.   


  


  (b) The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or any predecessor of the Corporation or serves or served at any other enterprise as a director or officer at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor to the Corporation against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such Proceeding. Such right may include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the maximum extent permitted under the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in the bylaws, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such person only if the Proceeding was authorized in the specific case by the board of directors.   (c) The Corporation may indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to a Proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or any predecessor of the Corporation, or serves or served at any other enterprise as an employee or agent at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor to the Corporation, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such Proceeding.

(d) Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article SIXTH, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article SIXTH, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article SIXTH in respect of any matter occurring, or any Proceeding accruing or arising or that, but for this Article SIXTH, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.   SEVENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, the Corporation acknowledges that: (i) each Exempted Stockholder (as defined below), director employed by an Exempted Stockholder or one of its affiliates, officer affiliated with an Exempted Stockholder or one of its affiliates and any other officer or director of the Corporation specifically designated by an Exempted Stockholder or one of its affiliates (collectively, the “Exempted Persons”) shall have no duty (contractual or otherwise) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, including those deemed to be competing with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; and (ii) in the event that any Exempted Person acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for the Corporation, then such Exempted Person shall have no duty (contractual or otherwise) to communicate or present such corporate opportunity to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, and shall not be liable to the Corporation or its affiliates or stockholders for breach of any duty (contractual or otherwise) by reason of the fact that such Exempted Person, directly or indirectly, pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person, or does not present such opportunity to the Corporation. For purposes of this Article SEVENTH, the term “Exempted Stockholder” shall mean all stockholders of the Corporation other than stockholders who are also officers or employees of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation or who are permitted transferees of any such person.

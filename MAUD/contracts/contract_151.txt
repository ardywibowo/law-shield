Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with the Dissenting Shareholder Statute (it being understood that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such Company Stockholder shall cease to have any voting or other rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with the Dissenting Shareholder Statute); provided, however, that if any such Company Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to the Dissenting Shareholder Statute, then the right of such holder to any such payment shall cease and such Dissenting Company Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become cancelled and exchanged solely for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.12. (ii) Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal. The Company will give Parent (A) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the TBOC and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the TBOC in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section 2.10(c)(ii), “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the TBOC in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected) and may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands, but Parent will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth above. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing   29





2.11 Equity Awards. (a) Company Stock-Based Awards. Prior to the Effective Time and subject to Section 2.11(e), the Company will take all necessary actions (including obtaining consents, if applicable) so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock-Based Award outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested in accordance with its terms, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, (i) to the extent not previously vested, be deemed fully vested (as set forth in the applicable award and/or other agreements between the Company and the applicable holder) immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time, and (ii) at the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into and become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the purchase price per Share, if any, of such Company Stock-Based Award) by (ii) the total number of Shares then subject to such Company Stock-Based Award (as set forth in the applicable award and/or other agreements between the Company and the applicable holder) (the “Company Stock-Based Award Consideration”). (b) Company Options. Prior to the Effective Time and subject to Section 2.11(e), the Company will take all necessary actions (including obtaining consents, if applicable) so that, at the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested in accordance with its terms, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, accelerate vesting in full and be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) (A) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Per Share Price less the exercise price per share of such Company Option (or (B), to the extent provided in an Employment Termination Benefits Agreement, if greater, the fair value of the Company Option as determined by GAAP), by (ii) the total number of Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the “Option Consideration”). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, except as provided in an Employment Termination Benefits Agreement, with respect to any Company Options for which the exercise price per share of such Company Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Company Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. ( c ) Payment Procedures . Except to the extent Company Stock Based Awards or Company Options are treated as contemplated in the first sentence of Section 2.11(e), at or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Company Stock-Based Award Consideration owed to all holders of Company Stock-Based Awards; and (ii) Option Consideration owed to all holders of Company Options. Not later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least fifteen days following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options will receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, of any amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or Section 2.11(b), as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or Section 2.11(b), as applicable, (A) cannot be made through the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent to such holder promptly following the Closing Date, or (B) constitutes deferred compensation under Code Section 409A, then the timing of such payment will be made in a manner that is intended to comply with Code Section 409A so as not to result in adverse tax consequences thereunder for such holder. Notwithstanding   30





the above, any payment (including, if applicable, payments in kind) to holders of Section 102 RSUs and to holders of Section 3(i) RSUs shall be paid to the Section 102 Trustee, in full without any withholding of Taxes (provided that the Company obtained the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling or the Israeli Tax Ruling prior to Closing) to be held and released in accordance with the provisions of Section 102 (if applicable) and the Israeli Tax Ruling, and for further distribution to the beneficial holders subject to the receipt (on or after Closing) by the Section 102 Trustee of a duly executed Section 102 Shareholder Document in relation to any payment to holders of Section 102 RSUs, and of a duly executed Section 3(i) RSU Holder Acknowledgement in relation to any payment to holders of Section 3(i) RSUs. (d) Necessary Further Actions. The Company will take all action necessary to effect the cancellation, or cancellation and continuation, as applicable, of Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options as of the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.11 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) and to cause all Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options and all Company Stock Plans and other rights thereunder to terminate (subject to replacement, as applicable) as of the Effective Time. (e) Assumption of Awards. Parent may, in its sole discretion, elect to assume or substitute some or all of the Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options in a manner contemplated by Section 22 of the applicable Company Stock Plan (it being understood that for any Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options subject to such assumption or substitution, no accelerated vesting will occur in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement). In the event Parent elects such treatment, it will notify the Company of such decision by no later than seven (7) calendar days following the Offer Commencement Date. Except as contemplated in connection with such election, no Company Options or Company Stock-Based Award shall be continued, converted, assumed or replaced by the Surviving Corporation in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with the foregoing, within three Business Days following the date hereof, the Company shall provide Parent with a complete and accurate list, as of the Capitalization Date, of all Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options, listing for each, as applicable: (i) the type of award, (ii) the number of underlying shares of Company Common Stock, (iii) the vesting schedule and applicable vesting criteria, (iv) the exercise price, (v) expiration date, and (vi) whether such award is intended to be tax-qualified. 2.12 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) designate the Company’s transfer agent or select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent. (b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.10, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Shares become entitled pursuant to Section 2.10. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available); or (iv) in mutual funds investing in such assets (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund   31





diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.10; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.10 for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.10. Any interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. (c) Exchange and Payment Procedures. (i) Certificated Shares. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.14) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes in respect thereof). The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.12(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10. (ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Shares held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding Share (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” or such other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares by   32





(B) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes in respect thereof). The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.12(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any payment (including, if applicable, payments in kind) to holders of Section 102 Shares shall be paid to the Section 102 Trustee, in full without any withholding of taxes (provided that the Company obtained the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling or the Israeli Tax Ruling prior to Closing), to be held and released in accordance with the provisions of Section 102 and the Israeli Tax Ruling, and for further distribution to the beneficial holders subject to the receipt (on or after Closing) by the Section 102 Trustee of a duly executed Section 102 Shareholder Document in relation to any payment to holders of Section 102 Shares. (d) DTC Payment . Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Shares (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes in respect thereof) (such amount, the “ DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date. (e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.10 may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any applicable stock transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered. (f) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   33





(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such Shares for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.12 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes in respect thereof) payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.10. 2.13 No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously representing any Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.10 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.10(c)). The consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any Shares will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.12(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 2.14 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates . In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes in respect thereof) payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.10. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 2.15 Required Withholding. (a) Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment pursuant to the Code or any other applicable federal, state, local or foreign Laws related to Taxes. Any such amounts are so deducted or withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein: (i) any amounts or, if applicable, equity securities of Parent payable to a Section 102 Holder under this Agreement in respect of Section 102 Shares and Section 102 RSUs, shall be paid to or deposited with the Section 102 Trustee in full without any withholding of taxes (provided that the Company obtained the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling or the Israeli Tax Ruling prior to Closing), and the Section 102 Trustee shall deduct and withhold from such consideration such amounts as the Section 102 Trustee is required to deduct   34





and withhold with respect to the making of any such payment (after taking into account any Israeli Tax withheld from the amount paid to the Section 102 Trustee, if any) under any applicable Israeli Tax Law, the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling, and the Israeli Tax Ruling, at the applicable rate for such withholding (any and all taxes withheld are referred to herein, the “Section 102 Withheld Tax”); (ii) the Section 102 Withheld Tax, if any, so withheld and transferred by the Section 102 Trustee to the ITA shall be deemed, for all purposes, as having been paid to the Section 102 Holder on account of the consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to such Section 102 Holder under this Agreement; and (iii) any amounts payable to a Section 3(i) Holder under this Agreement in respect of Section 3(i) RSUs, shall be subject to deduction or withholding of Israeli Tax under the Ordinance and according to the terms of the Israeli Tax Ruling (or the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling); and (iv) the Section 102 Trustee shall be entitled to withhold Israeli Taxes with respect to the consideration payable (including, if applicable, payments in kind) to Section 102 Holders and Section 3(i) Holders from and after the sixteenth (16th) calendar day of the calendar month following the month during which the Closing occurs, unless the Israeli Tax Ruling or the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling are provided prior to such time, and in such case, the Section 102 Trustee shall act in accordance with the Israeli Tax Ruling or the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling, as applicable. 2.16 Future Dividends or Distributions . No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. 2.17 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and interest in and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then (a) the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action and (b) the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assumptions and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise any and all right, title and interest in, to and under, or duty or obligation with respect to, such assets, property, rights, privileges, powers or franchises, or any such debts or liabilities, in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties and assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of “good standing” is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Bylaws, each as amended to date. The Company is not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws in any material respect. 3.2 Corporate Power; Enforceability . The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b) perform its covenants and obligations under this Agreement; and (c) assuming that the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 21.459(c) of the TBOC, consummate the Transactions.

(b) Fairness Opinion.

( 2 ) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, (x) the Company and each of its Representatives has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 and (y) the Company and its Representatives, until 11:59 p.m. Central time at the last day of the Event Notice Period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requests to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); and (3) following such Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other information provided by Parent) shall have determined that the failure of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; provided, that each time material modifications to the Intervening Event occur, the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time period set forth in the preceding clause (2) shall recommence and be extended for two Business Days from the day of such notification. (ii) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3 and that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if: (1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; (2) the Company and each of its Representatives has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3; (3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in advance (the “Proposal Notice Period” ) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(ii) absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the price and other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and include copies of all relevant documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, until 11:59 p.m. Central time on the last day of the Proposal Notice Period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent   66





desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (2) taken into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and related Transaction Documents proposed by Parent and other information provided by Parent during the Proposal Notice Period, in each case, that are offered in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59 p.m. Central time on the last day of the Proposal Notice Period, it being understood that (a) in the event of any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(d)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (with the “Proposal Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice being two Business Days); (4) at the end of the Proposal Notice Period (including any subsequent Proposal Notice Period as provided in the final proviso of the foregoing Section 5.3(d)(ii)(3)), the Company Board (or a committee thereof) must have in good faith (after taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other information provided by Parent) reaffirmed its determination that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; and (5) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(i), including paying the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b)(iii). (e) Notice to Parent. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours from the receipt thereof, whether or not such 24-hour period ends on a Business Day) notify Parent in writing if any Acquisition Proposal, or inquiry from any Person or Group related to making a potential Acquisition Proposal, is, to the Knowledge of the Company (which, for this purpose, will be deemed to include each Specified Person and will not be deemed to be only as of the date hereof), received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal, inquiry, request or offer; and (B) copies of any written materials relating thereto provided to the Company or its Representatives or, if such written materials are not available, a summary of the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals (including any updates or amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. (f) Permitted Disclosures. So long as the Company Board (or a committee thereof) expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure (other than in a customary “stop, look and listen” communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act): (i) nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including making a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); (B) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the   67

This Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(d)) shall not apply to filings under any Antitrust Law, Investment Law or CFIUS, which shall be governed by the obligations (and subject to the limitations) set forth in Section 6.2. 

6.2 Antitrust and Investment Law Filings. (a) Filings Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Antitrust Laws and Investment Laws. Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, shall (i) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the Merger as required by the HSR Act within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement; and (ii) to the extent required in the reasonable judgment of counsel to Parent and the Company, file comparable pre-merger or post-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any Governmental Authority pursuant to other applicable Antitrust Laws or Investment Laws in connection with the Transactions, with Parent having primary responsibility for the making of such filings.

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, fully cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates with respect to the matters contemplated by this Section 6.2; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to any sale, divestiture, license or other disposition, or any restriction on its or its Subsidiaries’ activities, unless the consummation thereof is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing. (c) CFIUS. The Parties shall prepare and submit a CFIUS Declaration to CFIUS as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. If, at the conclusion of CFIUS’ thirty-day assessment period following the submission of such CFIUS Declaration, Parent determines it to be advisable, or CFIUS requests or requires, the Parties shall prepare and submit a draft joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the Transactions (the “Draft CFIUS Filing”) as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. After receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no further comments or inquiries related to the Draft CFIUS Filing, the Parties shall as soon as reasonably practicable submit a formal joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with respect to the Transactions (the “CFIUS Filing”). Parent shall have primary responsibility for the making of the CFIUS Declaration, Draft CFIUS Filing and CFIUS Filing. Parent shall pay all filing fees in connection with the CFIUS Declaration, Draft CFIUS Filing and CFIUS Filing,   70





but the Company shall bear its own costs for the preparation thereof.

(d) Cooperation. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, use their reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly notify the other Parties of (and, if in writing, furnish them with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise them of the contents of)) any material communication received by such Person from a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal notifications, filings, submissions or other written communications (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Transactions to a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and any developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect thereof, including with respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver; (B) the expiration of any waiting period; (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding under applicable Law; and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions; and (iii) not independently participate in any substantive meeting, hearing, proceeding or discussions with or before any Governmental Authority in respect of the Transactions without giving the other Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting, hearing, proceeding or discussion (whether in person, by telephone or otherwise), and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to “outside counsel” only and any such information shall not be shared with the Representatives of the other Party without approval of the Party providing the non-public information. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may redact any valuation and related information before sharing any information provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an “outside counsel” only basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have, except where prohibited by applicable Law, responsibility for determining the strategy for dealing with any Governmental Authority, including the DOJ, the FTC and CFIUS, regarding all Antitrust Laws and all Investment Laws or antitrust or foreign investment matters; provided that Parent shall consult with the Company in a reasonable manner and consider in good faith the views and comments of the Company in connection with the foregoing.

If the Company determines that it is required to file any document with the SEC in connection with the Transactions pursuant to applicable Law other than the Schedule 14D-9 (such document, as amended or supplemented, a “Required Company Filing”), then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Required Company Filing to   71





comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 or any Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company or any of its Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents and any Required Parent Filing will not, at the time that Offer Documents or such Required Parent Filing are filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. (ii) By Parent. On the date of filing and the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable), neither the Offer Documents nor any Required Parent Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents or any Required Parent Filing. The information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in Schedule 14D-9 and any Required Company Filing will not, at the time that Schedule 14D-9 or such Required Company Filing are filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.   72





(d) Furnishing Information. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of any Required Company Filing or any Required Parent Filing.

The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any amendment or revisions to any Required Company Filing or any Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on any Required Company Filing or any Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection therewith. 6.4 Merger Without a Stockholders’ Meeting.

Neither Parent nor the Company will (and each will cause their respective Representatives not to) take any action that would cause any “takeover” Law to become applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, and each of Parent, the Company and the Company Board will (a) take all actions within their power to ensure that no “anti-takeover” Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions; and (b) if any “anti-takeover” Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, take all action within their power to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions. 6 . 8 Access. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such   73





documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; or (d) such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand (it being understood that if the Company and its Subsidiaries do not provide any information in reliance on the exclusions in the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c), then the Company or such Subsidiary will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to Parent promptly upon obtaining knowledge that such information is being withheld and the Company or such Subsidiary will use reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent permitted, the applicable information or other matter in a way that would not prohibit any applicable Law or agreement, result in the waiver of any such privilege, cause a violation or default under such Contract). Nothing in this Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals or opinions. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform any “invasive” testing or soil, air or groundwater sampling, including any Phase I or Phase II environmental assessments. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must be directed to the Company’s General Counsel or another person designated in writing by the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, subject to applicable Law and this Section 6.8 (i) reasonably assist and reasonably cooperate with Parent and its Subsidiaries to facilitate planning for the post-Closing integration of the Company and its Subsidiaries with Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, at the request of Parent from time to time, reasonably assisting and cooperating with Parent and its Subsidiaries in the planning and development of a post-Closing integration plan), (ii) provide reasonable access to key personnel identified by Parent to facilitate Parent’s efforts with respect to the post-Closing retention of such key personnel and (iii) provide Parent with reasonable periodic updates on activities relating to the integration and performance of the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ existing businesses. 

6.9 Section 16(b) Exemption. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions, and any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Transactions by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

6.10 Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance. (a) Indemnified Persons. For a period of six years following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to and in accordance with any indemnification agreements entered into (and copies of which have been made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement) prior to the date of this Agreement between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees (and any person who becomes a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) for any acts or omissions by such Indemnified Persons occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth   74





anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement (and copies of which have been made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement). During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law. (b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and any indemnification agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries(to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time); and (ii) the Transactions, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Transactions (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In connection with any such Legal Proceeding of the type contemplated by this Section 6.10(b), (A) Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Person’s entitlement to indemnification under this Section 6.10 with respect thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation), whether or not Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding, in accordance with the applicable organizational documents or indemnification agreement; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which Parent or the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made in accordance with the applicable organizational documents or indemnification agreement.   75





(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the D&O Insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300 percent of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300 percent amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy (the “Tail Policy”) with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for the Tail Policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases the Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect. (d) Successors and Assigns. Proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10 if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns either (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person. (e) No Impairment; Third Person Beneficiary Rights. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if such Person were a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law. (f) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.   76





6.11 Employee Matters. (a) Acknowledgment; Cooperation. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable will occur as of the Effective Time. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and coordinate with the other Party to mitigate the effects of any applicable Taxes on the other Party and its respective directors and officers; provided that the foregoing shall not (i) require Parent or Merger Sub to make any payment or incur any liability or take, or consent to, any action that could reasonably be expected to delay the Closing, (ii) permit the Company to take any action that is not permitted under Section 5.2. (b) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time through the first anniversary thereof (or, if longer, the time period specified in any employment contract, severance arrangement, Employment Termination Benefits Agreement or change in control agreement) (“Company Benefit Plan Expiration Date”), the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans (other than the broad-based Company Benefit Plans referenced in Section 6.11(c) below, which shall be governed by such Section 6.11(c)) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and will not terminate or materially amend such Company Benefit Plans except as required by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plans after the Company Benefit Plan Expiration Date in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law. (c) Employment; Benefits. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by taking such actions, if any, as are required by applicable Law, provided that the Company provides all information necessary to take such actions prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one year following the Effective Time (or until an earlier termination of employment), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) (i) maintain for the benefit of Continuing Employees annual base salary, bonus and incentive opportunities, and other compensation and employee benefits (in each case, other than any paid time off or vacation, equity-based, change in control, retention, transaction bonus, severance or similar compensation or benefits (“Excluded Benefits”)) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company Plans”) on terms and conditions that are substantially similar in the aggregate than those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Benefits) on the date of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of any benefits or payments related to defined contribution benefit plans, such benefits and payment shall be deemed to be comparable provided that they are at least as favorable as the benefits or payments Parent or its applicable Subsidiary provides under its applicable defined contribution benefit plan to its similarly situated employees. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.11(c) shall limit or adversely affect Parent’s and Surviving Corporation’s obligations under Section 6.11(b). (d) Service Credit; New Plans. At or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will, and Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent to, exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be granted to the Continuing Employees credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits and vacation accrual where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual but not for purposes of any defined benefit pension plans or Excluded Benefits), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such   77





plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to, exercise commercially reasonably efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent they were waived (or fulfilled) under corresponding Old Plans, and Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries of Parent to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, offset and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under a similar Old Plan. (e) No Employment Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 6.11 are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.11 nor any provisions of this Agreement relating to Company Benefit Plans, express or implied, will be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee or any other person for any reason; (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to maintain or continue any Company Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment, modification, suspension or termination of any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates after the Effective Time; or (iii) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit Plan. 6.12 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 6.13 Public Statements and Disclosure. The initial press releases concerning this Agreement will be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company (other than with respect to the portion of any communication relating to a Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will consult with the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to become public, in each case to the extent relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, (i) the Company will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that are (A) required by applicable Law; (B) principally directed to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries so long as such   78





communications are consistent in all material respects with the previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually if approved by the other Party), or (C) solely to the extent related to a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change; and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that are (A) required by applicable Law; or (B) principally directed at any of its Affiliates and its and their Affiliates, Representatives, investors or other Persons in the ordinary course of business, in each case who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions or are otherwise consistent in all material respects with the previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually if approved by the other Party); or (C) solely to the extent related to a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change. 6.14 Transaction Litigation . During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will provide Parent with prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.2, the notice contemplated by the prior sentence will only be delivered to counsel to Parent and may be delivered by email. The Company will (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, in full or in part, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this Section 6.14, “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above. For the avoidance of doubt, any Legal Proceeding related to Dissenting Company Shares will be governed by Section 2.10(c). 6.15 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to applicable Law to cause (a) the delisting of the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time; and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. 6.16 Additional Agreements. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors of each Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action. 6.17 Credit Agreement. The Company will deliver to Parent, by no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing, a customary payoff letter (the “Payoff Letter” ) in connection with the repayment of all outstanding Indebtedness under or in connection with the Credit Agreement (including fees and expenses related thereto), which Payoff Letter, together with any related release documentation, shall provide for, among other customary items (and subject to receipt of the applicable payoff amount), customary Lien and guarantee releases. As required, Parent will provide (or cause to be provided) to the Company funds in an amount equal to the amount necessary for the Company to repay and discharge in full all amounts outstanding under or in connection with the terms of the Credit Agreement (including fees and expenses related thereto) in accordance with the Payoff Letter and the terms hereof. Substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, the Company will repay and discharge such Indebtedness and other amounts in accordance with the Payoff Letter and the terms hereof.   79





6.18 Vote at Merger Sub. Immediately following the execution and delivery of the Joinder by Merger Sub, Parent or its applicable Subsidiary, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will execute and deliver to Merger Sub (with a copy also sent to the Company) a written consent adopting this Agreement and approving the Transactions in accordance with the TBOC. 6.19 No Employment Arrangements. Except as approved by the Company Board, at all times during the Pre-Closing Period, Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will not permit any of their Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates to authorize, make or enter into, or commit or agree to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings (whether or not binding) with any director or executive officer of the Company (i) regarding any continuing employment or consulting relationship with the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time; or (ii) pursuant to which any such individual would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share Price in respect of such holder’s Shares; or (iii) pursuant to which such individual would agree to provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Transactions. 6.20 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board) shall use reasonable efforts to take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10 promulgated under the Exchange Act any “employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement” (within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act) between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who then holds Shares and to ensure that any such “employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement” fall within the safe harbor provision of such rule. Promptly upon Parent or any of its Affiliates entering into any such arrangement with any such Person, Parent will provide to the Company any and all information concerning such arrangements as may be needed by the Company to comply with this Section 6.20. 6.21 Israeli Tax Ruling. The Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and/or accountants to prepare and file with the ITA prior to the Closing, an application for the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling, and following Closing, an application for the Israeli Tax Ruling. Each of the Company, Merger Sub and the Parent shall cause their respective legal counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling and at a later stage the Israeli Tax Ruling. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable legal requirements to obtain the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling and at a later stage the Israeli Tax Ruling as promptly as practicable. To the extent the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling is obtained, all references herein to the Israeli Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer to the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling, until such time that a final definitive Israeli Tax Ruling is obtained. The final text of the application for the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling and the Israeli Tax Ruling, and the final texts of the Israeli Interim Tax Ruling and the Israeli Tax Ruling themselves, including appendices thereof, shall be subject to the prior written confirmation of the Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 6.22 Director and Officer Resignations. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of the directors and officers, in their capacities as such, of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than directors of the Subsidiaries whom Parent determines shall continue to serve in such capacities following the Effective Time), effective at the Effective Time.   80





ARTICLE VII CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

The respective obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible pursuant to applicable Law) at or prior to the Effective Time of each of the following conditions: ( a ) No Prohibitive Injunctions or Laws. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger will be in effect, no action will have been taken by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, and no Law will have been enacted, entered, issued, promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger, that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation of the Merger.

(b) Effect of Termination. Any proper and valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. Following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as applicable, except that Section 6.13, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX will each survive the termination of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms and, in any case, subject in all respects to this Section 8.2. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, but subject to Section 8.3, Section 9.10 and Section 9.16, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability for fraud or any material Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement. 8.3 Fees and Expenses. (a) General. Except as set forth in Section 6.2(a) and this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Transactions are consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in Section 2.12(e), Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions.   83





(b) Company Payments. ( i ) Future Transactions . If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(g); (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(g), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed (and not publicly withdrawn prior to the termination of the Agreement as described in clause (A)); and (C) within one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(g), as applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company will concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to Parent an amount equal to the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b), which Schedule may be updated by written notice by Parent from time to time). For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “15 percent” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50 percent.” (ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company must, within one Business Day following such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b), which Schedule may be updated by written notice by Parent from time to time). (iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(i), then the Company must, simultaneously with such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b), which Schedule may be updated by written notice by Parent from time to time). (c) Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages . The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Termination Fee, if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. (d) Payments; Default . If the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof, then Company will pay or cause to be paid to Parent the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) of Parent in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made) plus five percent through the date that such payment or portion thereof is actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law. Any payment under this Section 8.3(d) will be made by the Company to Parent or its designee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in Schedule 8.3(b).   84





(e) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Except in the event of fraud or any Willful Breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or agreement contained herein, if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Parent’s receipt of the Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and any amounts owed pursuant to Section 8.3(d), and Parent’s right to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10 (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.10), will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent and Merger Sub against (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and assignees of each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates and former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and assignees of each of the foregoing (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Company Related Parties” ) in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions. Except in the event of fraud or any Willful Breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or agreement contained herein, upon payment of the Termination Fee to Parent or its designee, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further monetary liability or obligation to (A) Parent or Merger Sub; or (B) the former, current and future direct or indirect holders of any equity, controlling persons, Representatives, Affiliates (other than Parent or Merger Sub), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent and Merger Sub (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions (except that the Company and its Subsidiaries (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent and Merger Sub may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) (with respect to the expenses of the Company) and Section 8.3(d), as applicable. (f) Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance.

Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with the Transactions in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they were the counterparty thereto. 9.7 Entire Agreement; Merger Sub. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to in this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Transaction Documents, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Transaction Document or otherwise, the Company may, subject in all respects to Section 8.2, Section 8.3, this Section 9.10 and Section 9.16 (and, in each case, the limitations set forth herein or therein) pursue both (i) a grant of specific performance and (ii) payment of monetary damages pursuant to Section 8.2(b). (b) Specific Performance. (i) Irreparable Damage. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that: (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.   88





( i i ) No Objections. The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement.

Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 9.12 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of Delaware, or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the Transactions; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. 9.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL . EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS,.

This Agreement and any amendments to this Agreement may be executed in one or more textually identical counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity. 9.15 No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative; (b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect; and (c) nothing set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the extent expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision of this Agreement. 9.16 Non-recourse. (a) As to Parties. Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Related Parties, that all Legal Proceedings (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to: (i) this Agreement, any of the Transaction Documents or the Transactions; (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents (including any representation or warranty made in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents); (iii) any breach or violation of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents; or (iv) any failure of the Transactions to be consummated, in each case, may be made only (A) against (and are those solely of) the Persons that are, in the case of this Agreement, expressly identified as parties to this Agreement, and in the case of the Transaction Documents, Persons expressly identified as parties to such Transaction Documents; and (B) in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement or such Transaction Documents, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents to the contrary, each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Related Parties, that no recourse under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or in connection with the Merger will be sought or had against any other Person, including any Related Party, and no other Person, including any Related Party, will have any liabilities or obligations (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise), for any claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the items in the clauses (i) through (iv), it being acknowledged and agreed   90

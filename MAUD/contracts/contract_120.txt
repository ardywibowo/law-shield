2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the Closing Date, (a) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company; (b) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease; and (c) the Company will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the “Surviving Corporation.” 2.2 The Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cause the Merger to be consummated pursuant to the DGCL by filing a certificate of merger in customary form and substance (the “Certificate of Merger”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in   23








________________


accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing and acceptance for record by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being referred to herein as the “Effective Time”). 2.3 The Closing. The consummation of the Merger will take place at a closing (the “Closing”) to occur (a) remotely at 9:00 a.m., Central time, on the date that is two (2) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions); or (b) such other time, location and date as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company mutually agree in writing; provided that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in Article VII, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), the Closing shall instead occur on the date that is the earlier to occur of (i) any Business Day during the Marketing Period specified by Parent to the Company on no less than two (2) Business Days’ notice to the Company and (ii) the second Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period, but subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the “Closing Date”. 2.4 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger will be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all (a) of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation; and (b) debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 2.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. (a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 6.10, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the “Charter”), will be amended and restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation will become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation will be “RealPage, Inc.” (b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 6.10, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.   24








________________


2.6 Directors and Officers. (a) Directors. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. (b) Officers. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the officers of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed. 2.7 Effect on Capital Stock. (a) Capital Stock. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or by Parent and the applicable holder, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following will occur: (i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; (ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than with respect to Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $88.75, without interest thereon, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Per Share Price”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11); and (iii) each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that is (A) held by the Company as treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the “Owned Company Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.   25








________________


(b) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock and the Company Equity Awards occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. (c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all Shares that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL subject to any required withholding of Taxes, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become cancelled and exchanged for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.9. (ii) The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section 2.7(c)(ii), “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth above.   26

2.8 Equity Awards. (a) Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option (whether vested or unvested) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in each case, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash, less applicable Tax withholdings, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess of the Per Share Price over the per share exercise price of such Company Option, by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 2.8(a) (the “Option Consideration”) as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date. (b) Company Restricted Stock Awards. (i) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award granted prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any such award set forth on Section 2.8(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in each case, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Restricted Stock Award becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash, less applicable Tax withholdings, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Price by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall be the maximum number of shares assuming satisfaction of all applicable performance goals in the case of any such award subject to performance based vesting conditions). The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 2.8(b)(i) (the “RSA Consideration”) as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date. (ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award granted after the date of this Agreement (subject to compliance with Section 5.2) or set forth on Section 2.8(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in each case, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Price by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall be the maximum number of shares assuming satisfaction of all applicable performance goals in the case of any such award subject to performance based vesting conditions). Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.8(b)(ii), the cash-based award provided for by this Section 2.8(b)(ii) shall be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Award (including the time-based vesting conditions in the applicable award agreement), except that the award immediately shall vest upon a Qualifying Termination as such term is defined in Section 5.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter.   27








________________


(c) Further Actions. The Company (including the Company Board or any committee thereof which governs or administers the outstanding Company Equity Awards and/or the Company Equity Plan) shall, prior to the Effective Time, take or cause to be taken all actions to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.8 and to terminate the Company Equity Plans, effective as of the Effective Time; such that, following the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company Equity Awards (whether vested or unvested). 2.9 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) designate the Company’s transfer agent or such other bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent. (b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. (c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the   28








________________


“Certificates”); and (ii) subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.9(c), uncertificated Shares that represented outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Uncertificated Shares”) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7. (d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Central time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (A) the number of Shares (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Central time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date. (e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price   29








________________


may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered. (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such Shares for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto. 2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   30

2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 2.12 Required Withholding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and their Affiliates will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Shares or Company Equity Awards, or any other applicable Person, such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 2.13 No Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. 2.14 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters, other than the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing Letters (such conditions precedent, the “Financing Conditions”). As of the Agreement Date and assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, Parent has no reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors, as applicable, are not in default or breach under the terms and conditions of the Financing Letters and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a Financing Condition, in each case on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor, as applicable. Parent, or an Affiliate thereof on its behalf, has fully paid any and all commitment or other fees and amounts required by the Financing Letters to be paid on or prior to the Agreement Date and Parent will pay in full (or cause to be paid in full) as and when due any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. (d) No Amendments. As of the Agreement Date, the Financing Letters have not been amended or modified in any manner, and the respective commitments contained therein have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect by Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated by Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto. (e) No Other Arrangements. As of the Agreement Date, other than the Redacted Fee Letter, there are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the Financing Letters or the Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that affect the conditionality, availability or amount of the Financing.   53

(f) Sufficiency of Financing. The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Financing Letters, will provide Parent and Merger Sub at and as of the Closing Date with sufficient available funds (after netting out original issue discount and similar premiums and charges after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under the Financing Letters) to consummate the Merger and to make all payments required to be made in connection therewith, including payment of the aggregate consideration to which the holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7, the RSA Consideration, the Option Consideration, the payment of any indebtedness required to be repaid, refinanced, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger (including all indebtedness of the Company Group contemplated to be repaid by the Financing Letters or required by its terms to be repaid, refinanced, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger), any amounts due in respect of the Convertible Notes, the Company Warrant Documentation, the Company Call Option Documentation and the Company Capped Call Documentation and all premiums and fees required to be paid in connection therewith and all other amounts to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the Closing and associated costs and expenses of the Merger, in each case regardless of whether payable before or after the Closing (such amounts, collectively, the “Required Amounts”). (g) No Conditionality. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent or any Affiliate thereof or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder. 4.12 Stockholder and Management Arrangements. As of the Agreement Date, neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or committed or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings (whether or not binding) with any stockholder (other than any existing limited partner of any Guarantor or any of its Affiliates), director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company Group (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or the Merger; or (ii) the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment) from and after the Effective Time; or (b) pursuant to which any (i) such holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per Share Price in respect of such holder’s shares of Company Common Stock; (ii) such holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this Agreement or vote against any Superior Proposal; or (iii) such stockholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company other than any Guarantor has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.   54

4.13 Solvency. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor is entering into this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the any Company Group Member. As of the Effective Time and immediately after giving effect to the Merger (including the payment of the Required Amounts), assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III, (a) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will exceed the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as such liabilities become absolute and matured; (b) the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, at a fair valuation, will exceed their liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent liabilities); (c) the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which they are engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (d) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have incurred liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond their ability to pay such liabilities as they mature or become due. 4.14 No Competing Business. As of the Agreement Date, none of Parent, or any Affiliate of Parent with direct or indirect capital or other interests of more than ten percent (10%) in Parent, (i) directly competes with, or has direct or indirect capital or other interests of more than ten percent (10%) in, any other corporation, partnership, limited liability company or business organization that directly competes with the Company Group or (ii) has entered into any agreement to acquire or make any investment of greater than ten percent (10%) ownership in any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business organization or any division or assets thereof, that directly competes with the Company Group. 4.15 Money Transmitter License Approvals. At all times prior to the Agreement Date, none of Parent, Thoma Bravo, L.P., any Affiliated investment funds advised or managed by Thoma Bravo, L.P., or any managing partners or investment professionals of Thoma Bravo, L.P. who are required to be approved as “control persons” in the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System, has been denied a finding of suitability by any Governmental Authority, including by any state banking department or similar agency, relating to any Money Transmitter License or financial services-related business, or had any Money Transmitter License revoked or suspended, in each case, which would prevent or materially delay receipt of the Specified Consents. To the actual knowledge of Parent as of the date of this Agreement, there are no nonpublic facts and circumstances specific to Parent, Thoma Bravo, L.P., any Affiliated investment funds advised or managed by Thoma Bravo, L.P., or any managing partners or investment professionals of Thoma Bravo, L.P. who are required to be approved as “control persons” in the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System, which are reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay receipt of the Specified Consents. 4.16 Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties; Investigation. (a) No Other Representations and Warranties. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III or in any closing certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(c): (i) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other Person makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses, operations or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the Merger;   55

(b) No Reliance. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III and in any closing certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(c), it is not acting (including, as applicable, by entering into this Agreement or consummating the Merger) in reliance on: (i) any representation or warranty, express or implied; (ii) any estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or other materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, including any materials or information made available in the electronic data room hosted by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Merger, in connection with presentations by the Company’s management or in any other forum or setting; or (iii) the accuracy or completeness of any other representation, warranty, estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or other materials or information.

(c) Investigation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, Contracts, Intellectual Property, real estate, technology, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company Group, and each of them acknowledges that it and its Representatives have received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts and other assets of the Company Group and that it and its Representatives have had the opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company Group.

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives, during such Event Notice Period, must have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranty to obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, in response to such Intervening Event; and (B) taken into account any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and/or the Guaranty proposed by Parent and other information provided by Parent in response to the notice described in clause (1) of this Section 5.4(e)(i), in each case, that are offered in writing by Parent, no later than 11:59 p.m. (Central time) on the last day of the Event Notice Period, in a manner that would constitute a binding agreement between the parties if accepted by the Company; and (3) following such Event Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account Parent’s proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) shall have determined that the failure of the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to make such a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; provided that each time material modifications to the Intervening Event occur, the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time period set forth in the preceding clause (2) shall recommence and be extended for two (2) Business Days from the day of such notification. (ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether during the Go-Shop Period or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not take any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) or (B) unless: (1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;   66

(f) Notice. (i) From the Agreement Date until the first to occur of the No-Shop Period Start Date and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives receives any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (provided that, solely for this purpose, all references to “20%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “80%), including copies of any written materials relating thereto provided to the Company or its Representatives. Within two (2) Business Days following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice setting forth (A) the identity of each Excluded Party and (B) the material terms and conditions of the pending Acquisition Proposal made by such Excluded Party.

(ii) From the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent if any Inquiries, offers or proposals or requests for non-public information or discussions that constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any material revisions to the terms and conditions of any pending Acquisition Proposals disclosed pursuant to Section 5.4(f)(i), are received by the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Third Person making such Inquiries, offers or proposals, (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Inquiries, offers or proposals to the extent such material terms and conditions are not included in the written materials provided in the following clause (iii); and (iii) copies of any written materials relating thereto provided to the Company or its Representatives. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status (and supplementally provide the material terms) of any such Inquiries, offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto and any new, amended or revised written materials relating thereto provided to the Company or its Representatives) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.   68

necessary, reasonably designate material provided to the other party as “Outside Counsel Only Material.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any filing or supplement thereto required by a Governmental Authority that may include sensitive financial or other information with respect to Parent or any partner, equity holder, investment professional, executive or Affiliate of Parent or the Guarantors, or any Affiliates or representative of the foregoing, such person may elect, in such person’s sole discretion, to provide such information to such Governmental Authority directly through its legal counsel. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, and, in connection with any notices, reports, filings or applications in connection with a change of control of Licensee, Parent shall cause its and its Affiliates’ respective partners, equity holders, investment professionals or executives to, cooperate in responding as promptly as reasonably practicable to any investigation or other inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including any state banking department or similar agency, including informing the other Party as soon as practicable of any such investigation or inquiry, and consulting in advance, to the extent practicable, before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, including any state banking department or similar agency.

(II) In connection with obtaining any approvals or consents in connection with a change of control to the extent required by a Money Transmitter License of any Company Group Member, the Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts following the Licensee Consent Deadline to implement, to the extent permissible by Law, Alternative Arrangements with respect to the operations of the Company Group governed by the Company Group’s Money Transmitter Licenses, such as payee agent arrangements or other uses of third parties, to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Alternative Arrangement shall be implemented prior to the Licensee Consent Deadline without the prior written approval of Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including Section 7.1(c)), the Parties agree to consider in good faith all available Alternative Arrangements in a particular jurisdiction before surrendering the Money Transmitter License in such jurisdiction. None of the Company Group Members shall publicly announce, or make any disclosures to any Governmental Authorities or customers with respect to, an intention to implement Alternative Arrangements prior to the Licensee Consent Deadline without the prior written approval of Parent (it being understood that in no event shall (x) the public disclosure of this Agreement or (y) the disclosure of this Agreement or any of the related transaction documents as requested or required by Law or any Governmental Authority, including by any state banking department or similar agency, be deemed a breach of this sentence). Without limitation of the preceding sentence (including the proviso therein), the Company shall provide any public announcement of, or any disclosure to Governmental Authorities or customers with   72

respect to, any Alternative Arrangement to Parent a reasonable time prior to making such announcement or disclosure and consider in good faith any comments proposed by Parent or its Representatives.

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to identify and disclose to Parent as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement any Payments Contract which would have been required to be disclosed in Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter had Payments Contracts been included within the definition of Material Contracts. For the avoidance of doubt, actions taken by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.2(b)(II) shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.2. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, Parent, Merger Sub and/or any of their respective partners, equity holders, investment professionals, executives or Affiliates to (1) (A) make any payment to any third party (other than filing and application fees to Governmental Authorities (and related expenses incurred in connection therewith), payments to its third party Representatives working on its behalf to obtain approvals and consents or reasonable confirmations of compliance with obligations and reporting requirements) in order to obtain any consent or approval; or (B) (1) agree to invest any additional capital in Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (2) take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent or any material Affiliate of Parent, taken as a whole. 6.3 Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings. (a) Proxy Statement.

If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an “Other Required Company Filing”), then the Company will promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of   73

the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that such Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. (c) Other Required Parent Filing. If Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates determines that it is required to file any document with the SEC in connection with the Merger or the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to applicable Law (an “Other Required Parent Filing”), then Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates to cause, any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC. Neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any amendment thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing may contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filing. The information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing will not, at the time that the Proxy Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

6.10 Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, as now or hereafter in effect: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or during the period from the date hereof through the Effective Time will be, serving as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of any Company Group Member (collectively, the “Covered Persons”) in connection with any D&O Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such D&O Claim and (ii) promptly advance to such Covered Person any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any D&O Claim in advance of the final disposition of such D&O Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Covered Person of any Claim Expenses incurred by such Covered Person in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security. In the event of any such D&O Claim, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Covered Person in the defense of any such D&O Claim. All rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such Person’s heirs, successors, executors and personal and legal representatives. (b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, limitations on liability of Covered Persons, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons than are set forth as of the date hereof in the Charter and the Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any D&O Claim (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.10(b) shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such D&O Claim. Following the Effective Time, the indemnification Contracts, if any, in existence on the Agreement Date with any of the Covered Persons shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. (c) At the Company’s option and expense, or if Parent requests, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Merger) of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered individuals as the Company Group’s existing directors’ and   83

officers’ insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time for D&O Claims arising from facts, acts, events or omissions that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; provided that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company Group for such insurance (such amount being the “Maximum Premium”). If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain such a tail policy; provided, however, that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium; provided, further, that if such tail policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any such policy (whether obtained by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation) to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all its obligations thereunder. (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) sells all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10(d). (e) The obligations under this Section 6.10(e) shall not be terminated or modified in any manner that is adverse to any Covered Persons (and their respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that each Covered Person (including their respective successors and assigns) shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.10(e). In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this Section 6.10(e), the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.10(e) as such fees are incurred, upon the written request of such Covered Person. 6.11 Employee Matters. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, honor all Employee Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if sooner, on the date of termination of employment of the relevant Continuing Employee), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee, (i) base salary and base wages, short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities, commission opportunities, severance payments and severance benefits, each on a basis no less favorable than that in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation and retiree or post-termination welfare benefits or compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation and retiree or post-termination welfare benefits or compensation) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.   84

(b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation’s health and welfare benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to participate under the health and welfare benefits plans of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time); provided, however, that (i) nothing in this Section 6.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent, its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate, in accordance with its terms, any benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, agreement, Contract or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 6.11(a), and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period) in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, then the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporation’s (or a Subsidiary’s) health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant under any 401(k) plan of Parent or Subsidiary of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall ensure that such benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, credit Continuing Employees for their years of service prior to the Effective Time with the Company Group or their respective predecessors; provided that, no credit for any service will be required that would result in duplication of benefits and such credit shall only be given to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding benefit plan of a Company Group Member. Nothing in this Section 6.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Person to employment, engagement or service or any right to continued employment, engagement or service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be “at will” employment. (c) With respect to any group health plans maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees participate following the Effective Time and in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any of its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements under any such group health plans to the same extent waived or satisfied under any corresponding Employee Plan of a Company Group Member in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations under such group health plans in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, to amounts paid by such Continuing Employees during the portion of the year prior to the Effective Time under the Employee Plans maintained by a Company Group Member. (d) The Company may, immediately prior to the Effective Time, provide to each employee who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, is employed by a Company Group Member and is eligible to participate in an annual bonus program of a Company Group Member a pro-rated portion of the annual bonus with respect to the period from January 1, 2021 through the date on which the Closing occurs, which bonus shall be determined based on the greater of target performance and actual performance through the latest practicable date prior to the Closing Date, as determined by the Company prior to the Effective Time.   85

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no provision of this Section 6.11 is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any Employee Plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any other Person (other than the Parties) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. 6.12 Obligations of Merger Sub.

The initial press release concerning this Agreement and the Merger of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company.

Accordingly, if either Party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, the payee Party commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the payor Party for the amount set forth in Section 8.3 or any portion thereof, the payor Party will pay to the payee Party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (the “Enforcement Expenses”). All payments under this Section 8.3 shall be made by the payor Party to the payee Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the payee Party.   96

(f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. (i) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (including the Company’s right to enforce the Guaranty with respect thereto and receive the Parent Termination Fee from the Guarantors), the Reimbursement Obligations and the Company’s right to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 9.8 will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company and the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any breach, termination or failure. Upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of (A) the Company and its Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the Company and its Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 8.3(e), as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(i) will not relieve Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor from liability (1) for any fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement or (2) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for breaches (including any Willful Breach) under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement), the Guaranty or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal to $528,000,000 plus the Enforcement Expenses and the Reimbursement Obligations in the aggregate for all such breaches (the “Parent Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against (A) Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor; or (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub and each Guarantor (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”), and in no event will the Company be entitled to seek or obtain consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by any Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure;   97








________________


provided that the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing, nor limit the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. Other than the Guarantors’ obligations under the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than any Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger. (ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee, to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b), the Reimbursement Obligations and Parent’s right to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 9.8 will be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and the Parent Related Parties against the Company Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any breach, termination or failure. Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to any of Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor, or the Parent Related Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for any matters forming the basis of such termination. Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) will be the only monetary damages of Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates may recover from Company Related Parties in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 8.3(e), as applicable); and (2) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(ii) will not relieve the Company Group from liability (1) for any Willful Breach of this Agreement or (2) for any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by   98

the Company for breaches under this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed an amount equal to $288,000,000 in the aggregate for all such breaches, plus the Enforcement Expenses (if any) (the “Company Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against any of the Company Related Parties, and in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to seek or obtain consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against the Company Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. (iii) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that any amount payable by the Company or Parent pursuant to this Section 8.3, including the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, does not constitute a penalty, but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under this Agreement in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. (g) Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.3(f), it is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.8(a), except that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 9.8(a) (and, if the Company elects, doing so concurrently with seeking monetary damages and/or payment of the Parent Termination Fee), under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.8(a), on the one hand, and payment of the Parent Termination Fee, Enforcement Expenses and Reimbursement Obligations as and when due, pursuant to this Section 8.3, on the other hand. (h) Non-Recourse Parent Party. In no event will the Company seek or obtain, nor will it permit any of its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Non-Recourse Parent Party (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter, which excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, each Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub) with respect to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by any Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, other than from Parent or Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement or any Guarantor to the extent expressly provided for in the Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter.   99

8.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such approval.

At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right. 8.6 No Liability of Financing Sources. None of the Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder; provided that nothing in this Section 8.6 shall limit the rights of the Company and its Affiliates from and after the Effective Time under any debt commitment letter or the definitive agreements for the Debt Financing executed in connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, under this Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or its Affiliates are party thereto.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. 9.4 Confidentiality. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that Thoma Bravo, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 27, 2020 (as amended, the “Confidentiality Agreement”), that will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Company furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto. 9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Guaranty and the Financing Letters, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

9.6 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 6.10 and this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by Section 6.10; and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and the Company Equity Awards to receive the Per Share Price set forth in Article I. The provisions of Section 8.3(f), Section 8.4, Section 8.6, Section 9.8(b), Section 9.10(b), Section 9.11 and this Section 9.6 will, subject to the rights of the Financing Commitment Sources set forth in the last sentence of Section 8.4, inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and assigns). 9.7 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 9.8 Remedies. (a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. (b) Specific Performance. (i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not timely perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company   103

nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that, subject to the limitations in the next two (2) sentences of this Section 9.8(b)(i), the Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Financing to be funded (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter) subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein and herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements for any Financing under the terms thereof, none of the Company and its Affiliates and their direct and indirect equityholders shall be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any Financing Source. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund a portion of the Required Amounts (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof if the Equity Financing is funded and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Company shall take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to consummate the Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. (ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. Each Party further agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in seeking and agreeing to an expedited schedule in any litigation seeking an injunction or order of specific performance to attempt to fully resolve any dispute before the Termination Date.   104

9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. 9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) General Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions and the Guaranty, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law. (b) Jurisdiction for Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to Section 8.6, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be brought in and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, county of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in any applicable debt commitment letter will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed by, construed in accordance with and enforced under the laws of the State of New York.   105

9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY OR LITIGATION THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, VALIDITY OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS, IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS, THE GUARANTY, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11. 9.12 Company Disclosure Letter References. The Parties agree that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. 9.13 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.   106

9.14 No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision hereof. 9.15 Performance Guaranty. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings that are required to be performed, discharged or complied with following the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation. 9.16 Disclaimer. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the sole contractual benefit of such parties. Such representations and warranties may be made as of specific dates, only for purposes of the Agreement and for the benefit of the parties hereto.

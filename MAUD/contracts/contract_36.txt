ARTICLE III 


EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 


Section 3.1 Effect on Securities. At the Effective Time (or such other time specified in this Section 3.1), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or any holder of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub or any other Person: (a) Expiration or Cancellation of Company Securities. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all issued and outstanding Rights will expire in their entirety without any payment being made in respect thereof in accordance with the Rights Agreement Amendment. Each share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (including shares held as treasury stock) or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as issued or outstanding shares, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.   3








________________


(b) Conversion of Company Securities. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $80.00 per share of Company Common Stock in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 3.1(b) shall no longer be issued or outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the “Certificates”) or book-entry evidence of shares (“Book-Entry Evidence”) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Evidence in accordance with Section 3.2, the Merger Consideration without interest thereon. (c) Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and become one (1) fully paid, non-assessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only issued or outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. (d) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or similar event, or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 3.1(d) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement. 


Section 3.2 Payment for Securities; Exchange of Certificates. (a) Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund. No later than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense, designate a reputable bank or trust company (the “Paying Agent”) that is organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as paying agent for the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, and shall enter into an agreement (the “Paying Agent Agreement”) relating to the Paying Agent’s responsibilities with respect thereto, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration (such Aggregate Merger Consideration as deposited with the Paying Agent, the “Exchange Fund”); provided that the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the written request of Parent, deposit with the Paying Agent at the Closing such portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration from the Company Cash on Hand as specified in such request. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 3.1(b), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an   4

amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments in full. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to Section 3.1(b). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 3.1, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. (b) Procedures for Exchange. (i) Certificates. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify). (ii) Book-Entry Evidence. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Book-Entry Evidence not held through The Depository Trust Company (and to deliver to The Depository Trust Company, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Evidence held through The Depository Trust Company) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify, and (B) instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book- Entry Evidence shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Evidence shall be required to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Evidence held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(b). (c) Timing of Exchange. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Evidence for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with, in the case of Certificates and Book-Entry Evidence not held through The Depository Trust Company, a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book-Entry Evidence held through The Depository Trust Company, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent, and such other documents as may be required   5

pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Evidence shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Evidence upon the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agent’s receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), Book-Entry Evidence or “agent’s message,” and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Evidence so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent Agreement shall provide that the Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Evidence upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Evidence on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Evidence. (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Evidence for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon written demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration (without any interest thereon) in respect thereof, subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. (e) No Liability. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(collectively, the “Guarantors”), pursuant to which the Guarantors have committed to invest in Parent, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the amounts set forth therein (the “Equity Financing” and, together with the Debt Financing, the “Financing”). The Equity Commitment Letters expressly provide, and will continue to expressly provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof. (b) As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments have not been restated, modified, amended or supplemented in any respect or waived and, except as permitted by Section 6.11(c), no such restatement, modification, amendment, supplement or waiver is contemplated, and the respective obligations and commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn, reduced, rescinded, amended, restated, otherwise modified or repudiated in any respect or terminated in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement and no such withdrawal, reduction, rescission, amendment, restatement, other modification, repudiation or termination is contemplated by Parent or the Acquisition Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, by any other party to the Financing Commitments. The Financing Commitments, in the forms so delivered, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub, as applicable, and, assuming due and valid execution by each other party thereto, the other parties thereto and are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against Parent and Acquisition Sub and against each of the other parties thereto, as the case may be, in each case, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws,   28

now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors’ rights and remedies generally and (ii) the remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. Except for the fee letter, and other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments, there are no engagement letters, side letters, contracts, understandings, agreements or other arrangements of any kind, whether written or oral, to which Acquisition Sub or Parent is a party relating to the Financing that would impose any new conditions or expand the existing conditions to the Financing or that would otherwise affect the availability of the Financing at the Closing. As of the date hereof, assuming the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 are satisfied at the Closing, (x) neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party to any of the Financing Commitments is, in default in the performance, observation or fulfillment of any obligation, covenant or condition contained in any Financing Commitment and (y) to the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to (i) constitute or result in a default under or breach on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub, or on the part of any other party under the Financing Commitments, (ii) constitute or result in a failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub or any other party to the Financing Commitments to satisfy, or any material delay in satisfaction, of any condition or other contingency to the full funding of the Financing under the Financing Commitments or (iii) otherwise result in any portion of the Financing such that Parent would not have sufficient cash proceeds to fulfill its Funding Obligations to be unavailable on a timely basis, and in any event, not later than the Closing. As of the date hereof, assuming the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 are satisfied at the Closing, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any flex provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis, and in any event, not later than the Closing, any term or condition of the Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing Commitments will not be available on the Closing Date if the terms or conditions to be satisfied by it contained in the Financing Commitments are satisfied. Parent and/or Acquisition Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the Financing Commitments and/or the Financing, in each case, to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 are satisfied at the Closing, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect of the maximum amount of “flex” (including any original issue discount flex) provided for under the Debt Financing) when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments, along with the Company Cash on Hand at Closing, will be, in the aggregate, sufficient and (other than Company Cash on Hand) available to (i) fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent and/or Acquisition Sub for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the Financing Commitments and (ii) perform all of Parent’s and Acquisition Sub’s payment obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, the Debt Payoff Amount and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.3, and the payment of all associated costs and Expenses of the Merger (including any fees and expenses related to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing) (the “Funding Obligations” and such sufficient proceeds, the “Funds”). There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full net proceeds (or any portion) of the Financing at or prior to the Closing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 9.9(b), Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that their respective obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon obtaining the Funds to satisfy the Funding Obligations.   29

Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response, except, in each case, for any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change or a Superior Proposal, or to the extent prohibited by Law.   36

(b) The Company shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as of the record date established for the Stockholders’ Meeting as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the later of (i) the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (the “SEC Clearance Date”) and (ii) the record date for the Stockholders’ Meeting; provided that if the SEC has failed to affirmatively notify the Company within ten (10) calendar days after the initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that it will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, then such date shall be the “SEC Clearance Date”. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders’ Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties thereof, and an appropriate amendment or supplement containing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company’s stockholders. (c) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the SEC Clearance Date, (i) establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the Merger and holding the Company Stockholder Advisory Vote (the “Stockholders’ Meeting”) and (ii) duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders’ Meeting (which shall in no event be scheduled for later than the thirtieth (30th) day following the first mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company’s stockholders). The Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders’ Meeting (and shall postpone or adjourn the Stockholders’ Meeting upon the reasonable request of Parent in the event of clauses (B), (C) and (D) only) (A) with the consent of Parent and Acquisition Sub, (B) for the absence of a quorum, (C) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to the Stockholders’ Meeting or (D) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act and take all action necessary to establish a record date for the Stockholders’ Meeting. Once the Company has established the record date for the Stockholders’ Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law. Unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.5, the Company shall, through the board of directors of the Company, provide the Company Recommendation and include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.5, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock held by them in favor of the approval of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to, and in accordance, with Article VIII, this Agreement shall be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), approval of this Agreement, holding the Company Stockholder Advisory Vote and adjournment shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the holders of Company Common Stock at the Stockholders’ Meeting.   37

connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of such agency or other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust and Foreign Investment Laws. In taking the foregoing actions, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, obtaining any Third Party Consents or waivers pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(ii) above or otherwise shall not be a condition to the obligations of any party to consummate the Merger. (b) Without limiting anything in this Section 6.3, (i) none of the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates shall extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and (ii) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary or reasonably advisable or as may be required by any Governmental Authority to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all Consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, as expeditiously as possible (and in any event at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date), including committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, (A) selling, divesting, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell, divest, license or otherwise dispose of, any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or Acquisition Sub, (B) terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or Acquisition Sub, (C) requiring Parent or Acquisition Sub or the Company or its Subsidiaries, to grant any right or commercial or other accommodation to, or enter into any material commercial contractual or other commercial relationship with, any Third Party and (D) imposing limitations on Parent or Acquisition Sub or the Company or its Subsidiaries, with respect to how they own, retain, conduct or operate all or any portion of their respective businesses or assets; provided that any such action contemplated by clause (ii) above is conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (c) Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including (i) promptly informing the other party of such inquiry, (ii) consulting in advance before making any material presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, (iii) giving the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in any substantive meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority and (iv) supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, submissions or written communications between either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement; provided, however, that the parties shall not be required to share copies of filings made under the HSR Act. The Company and Parent, in their respective sole and absolute discretion, may redact material as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, exclude any information relating to Company valuation and similar matters relating to the transactions contemplated herein, or designate any competitively sensitive material as “Outside Counsel Only Material” such that such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel.   39

Section 6.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent, the Financing Sources and their respective Representatives reasonable access, at Parent’s sole cost and expense, in a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice throughout the period commencing on the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII, to the properties, management personnel, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Representatives all information (to the extent not publicly available) concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent or Acquisition Sub if such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (a) cause significant competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (b) violate applicable Law or the provisions of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (c) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (provided, in each case, that the Company shall give Parent notice of any information so withheld and the parties shall cooperate in seeking to allow disclosure of such information in a manner that is not reasonably likely to cause significant competitive harm, violate applicable Law or Contract or cause any waiver of privilege); provided, further, that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any environmental testing involving sampling of soil, groundwater, air or other environmental medium or similar invasive techniques at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.4 to the extent that such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties. No investigation or access permitted pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

(including Acquisition Sub) not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.4 for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which transactions, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Financing). The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company’s officers, employees and other Representatives hereunder and, if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms prior to giving effect to the execution of this Agreement. 


Section 6.5 Non-Solicitation; Competing Proposals. (a) Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, from the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective directors and officers to, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party relating to any Competing Proposal or any inquiry, discussion or request that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, and the Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days of the date hereof) request in writing that each Third Party that has previously executed a confidentiality or similar agreement promptly return to the Company or destroy all non-public information previously furnished or made available to such Third Party or any of its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or its Representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement.

(b) From the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within one (1) calendar day of receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives of any Competing Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Proposal, deliver to Parent a written notice setting forth: (i) the identity of the Third Party making such Competing Proposal or inquiry, proposal or request and (ii) the material terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal or such inquiry, proposal or request (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed term sheets and agreements relating thereto). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and any material amendment or modification of (and supplementally provide the terms of) any such Competing Proposal, inquiry, proposal or request on a prompt basis, and the status of any discussions or negotiations, and in any event within one (1) calendar day following the Company’s receipt in writing of such an amendment or modification. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to compliance with the rest of this Section 6.5, at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, in the event that the Company receives a bona fide, unsolicited Competing Proposal from any Person which did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.5, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) the Company and its board of directors and their respective Representatives may engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information and other access to, any Person making such Competing Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of financing if the Company’s board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Competing Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; provided that (i) prior to furnishing any material nonpublic information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company receives from such Person, to the extent such Person is not already subject to a confidentiality agreement with the Company, an executed confidentiality agreement with such Person containing confidentiality terms that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision or otherwise restrict the making, or amendment, of a Competing Proposal to the Company or the Company’s board of directors (such confidentiality agreement, an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”) and (ii) any such material nonpublic information so furnished in writing shall be promptly made available to Parent to the extent it was not previously made available to Parent or its Representatives.   42

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company shall not (i) (A) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or propose publicly or otherwise to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, or fail to make, the Company Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, to the Company’s stockholders, or otherwise declare advisable, any Competing Proposal, (C) fail to publicly recommend against any Competing Proposal or fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation, in each case, within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing following a publicly announced Competing Proposal, (D) fail to recommend against any Competing Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Competing Proposal or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer that constitutes a Competing Proposal other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company’s board of directors or (E) fail to include the recommendation of the Company’s board of directors in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger in the Proxy Statement (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute, approve or enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 6.5(c)). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of the Company may (A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an event, occurrence, change, effect, condition, development or state of facts or circumstances (other than related to a Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal, or any proposal which constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal) that was neither known to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the Company’s board of directors as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company’s board of directors as of the date of this Agreement) (an “Intervening Event”) (where, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) the fact in and of itself that the Company meets or exceeds projections, forecasts or estimates (it being understood that the underlying causes of (or contributors to) such performance that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of “Intervening Event” may be taken into account) and (y) changes in and of themselves in the price of the Company Common Stock or the trading volume thereof shall be considered known and reasonably foreseeable occurrences (it being understood that the underlying causes of (or contributors to) such changes in price or trading volume that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of “Intervening Event” may be taken into account)), only if the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (B) if the Company has received a bona fide, unsolicited Competing Proposal which did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.5 and that is not withdrawn, and the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) (including making payment of the Termination Fee) and substantially concurrently enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Competing Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, if and only if, the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company has complied in all material respects with this Section 6.5 with respect to such Competing Proposal and the Person making   43

such Competing Proposal; provided, however, that (x) no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made and (y) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.5(d) and Section 8.1(c)(ii) may be effected, in each case unless and until: (i) the fourth (4th) Business Day (the “Notice Period”) following Parent’s receipt of a written notice from the Company advising Parent of the Company’s board of directors’ intent to make an Adverse Recommendation Change (a “Notice of Adverse Recommendation”) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.5(d) and Section 8.1(c)(ii) (a “Notice of Superior Proposal”), which Notice of Adverse Recommendation shall specify in reasonable detail the applicable Intervening Event or Superior Proposal and which Notice of Superior Proposal shall specify the terms and conditions (and include the most current version of each proposed Contract providing for such Superior Proposal, including any Contract relating to financing) of any such Competing Proposal which the board of directors of the Company has concluded constitutes a Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal, (ii) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent so desires to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that either the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would no longer be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company under applicable Law or such Competing Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, as appropriate, and (iii) in determining whether to make such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.5(d) and Section 8.1(c)(ii), as applicable, the board of directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement timely proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation or a Notice of Superior Proposal during the Notice Period (as may be extended). Any material revision to any Competing Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 6.5(d); provided that the new Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days (but in no event shorter than the original four (4) Business Day Notice Period). (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Company or the board of directors of the Company from taking or disclosing a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure to comply with applicable Law with regard to a Competing Proposal (it being agreed that a “stop, look and listen” communication by the board of directors to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or a factually accurate public statement by the Company that solely describes the Company’s receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change or give rise to a Parent termination right pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)); provided, that the Company does not make any recommendation in connection therewith other than a recommendation against such offer. (f) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) “Competing Proposal” shall mean any bona fide written proposal or offer made by any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates) or group of Persons as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act (x) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in one transaction or a series of transactions, (i) beneficial ownership (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) (or the right to acquire beneficial ownership) of more than twenty percent (20%) of the   44

total outstanding equity securities of the Company (by vote or value) pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer (including a self-tender offer), exchange offer, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction or (ii) any one or more assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that constitute more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues, earnings or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) with respect to the issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly to any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates) or group of Persons as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of securities (or options, rights, or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing more than 20% of the voting power of the Company, or (z) with respect to any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction involving the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person or group of Persons would have beneficial ownership (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) of securities representing more than 20% of the total outstanding equity securities of the Company (by vote or value) after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction. (ii) “Superior Proposal” shall mean a Competing Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) made by a Third Party that the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and considering all legal, regulatory and financing aspects of such Competing Proposal as the board of directors of the Company considers to be appropriate (including the identity of the Third Party), is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and if consummated would be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in writing in response to such Competing Proposal under the provisions of Section 6.5(d)). (g) Any breach of this Section 6.5 by any director, officer or Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. 


Section 6.6 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance. (a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification, contribution and advancement of expenses for facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of (or in a comparable role with) the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any person serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of (or in a comparable role with) another Person (the “D&O Indemnified Parties”), as the case may be, in each case, as provided in the respective organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any indemnification or similar agreements as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms (it being agreed that after   45

the Closing such rights shall be mandatory rather than permissive, if applicable), and Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to perform such obligations thereunder. Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer and employee (or comparable) liability that are no less favorable to the D&O Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not, for a period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the D&O Indemnified Parties except as required by applicable Law.

The Company shall on or prior to the Closing Date, provide Parent with a customary payoff letter (the “Payoff Letter”) from the agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, which Payoff Letter shall set forth the aggregate amount required to satisfy in full all such indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be discharged at the Closing and provide for the automatic release of Liens upon the payment of such amount. (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) prior to Closing, assist Parent in preparing to, following Closing, issue a notice of redemption for the aggregate principal amount of any of the Company Notes requested by Parent in writing, pursuant to the indentures governing the Company Notes (the “Company Indentures”) in order to effect a redemption and (ii) other than (A) the payment of funds by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates towards the redemption and/or satisfaction and discharge of the Company Notes under the Company Indentures, as applicable, and (B) requiring the Company to cause its counsel to deliver any legal opinions in connection with this Section 6.13(b), provide such other cooperation reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the redemption of the Company Notes (and/or, if elected by Parent, the satisfaction and discharge of any Company Indenture) following the Effective Time; provided that, in each case, Parent shall provide the Company the opportunity to review and comment on such notices and any other documents in connection with this Section 6.13(b) reasonably in advance of their delivery, without the Company being required to request such documents from Parent, and, after review and consultation, Parent shall accept, in all material respects, the Company’s comments. The Company shall not be required to take any action (i) until Parent has provided forms of the notice of redemption and other related documents or (ii) if the Company determines that such action would reasonably be expected to violate the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.   56

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

Section 8.3 Termination Fees. (a) In the event that: (i) (A) a Third Party shall have made to the Company or directly to the Company’s stockholders a Competing Proposal, or any Competing Proposal shall have been publicly made or disclosed, after the date of this Agreement, (B) this Agreement is subsequently terminated by (x) the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) or (y) Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) as a result of a knowing and intentional breach of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement by the Company, and any such Competing Proposal had not been withdrawn at least five (5) Business Days prior to the event giving rise to the termination of this Agreement, and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates a transaction involving a Competing Proposal or enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for the consummation of a Competing Proposal (which is subsequently consummated); provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 8.3(a)(i), the references to “twenty percent (20%)” in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%)”; (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii); or   62








________________


(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), then the Company shall, (A) in the case of clause (i) above, on the date of the consummation of such transaction involving a Competing Proposal, (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination, and (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay, or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, at the direction of Parent, the Termination Fee (it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion). (b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(iii) or (ii) the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) and, at the time of such termination, the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(iii), then Parent shall, in the case of termination by (A) Parent, simultaneously with such termination or (B) the Company, no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay, or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, at the direction of the Company, the Reverse Termination Fee (it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion). (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to Section 8.3(e) and Section 9.9, the Company’s receipt in full of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b), together with any Enforcement Expenses or payments pursuant to Section 6.11 and Section 6.12 of any Debt Costs, in circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b), shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Guarantors, the Debt Financing Sources or any of their respective Affiliates and all of their respective direct or indirect, former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”) for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that Parent shall also be obligated to comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement). The parties acknowledge and agree that while the Company may pursue a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.9(b) and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee in no event shall the Company be entitled to obtain both (x) a grant of specific performance pursuant to Section 9.9(b) that results in the Closing occurring and (y) payment of the Reverse Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Related Parties in the event Parent or Acquisition Sub fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise fails to comply with or breaches any covenant or other obligation or representation and warranty in this Agreement shall not exceed the Parent Liability Limit.   63








________________


(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to Section 8.3(e) and Section 9.9, Parent’s receipt in full of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(a), together with any Enforcement Expenses, in circumstances where the Termination Fee is owed pursuant to Section 8.3(a), shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective direct or indirect, former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount(s) (in circumstances where the Termination Fee is owed pursuant to Section 8.3(a)), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that if Parent receives any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3, the amount of such Termination Fee shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the Company prior to paying the Termination Fee in respect of any such breaches. (e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Termination Fee and the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iii) without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, either Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the payment of any amount set forth in this Section 8.3, such paying party shall pay the other party its costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of two percent (2%) plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (collectively, “Enforcement Expenses”); provided, however, that in no event shall the Enforcement Expenses payable by the Company, on the one hand, or the Enforcement Expenses and Debt Costs payable by Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, exceed $7.5 million in the aggregate. 


Section 8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Company and Parent at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that (i) after the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further approval of such stockholders and (ii) any amendment to this Section 8.4 or Section 8.3, Section 9.7, Section 9.8, Section 9.10 or Section 9.12, in each case to the extent such amendment would affect the rights of a Debt Financing Source under such Section in a manner that is materially adverse to such Debt Financing Source, shall also be approved by such Debt Financing Source. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.   64

Section 8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance for its benefit of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties made to it by another party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement or condition for its benefit contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. 


Section 8.6 Expenses; Transfer Taxes. Except as expressly set forth herein (including the following sentence), all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated; provided that Parent shall pay all costs and Expenses in connection with the filings of the notification and report forms under any Antitrust and Foreign Investment Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall or, following the Effective Time, shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, timely and duly pay all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, that any Taxes imposed on income or gains as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be for the account of the applicable Company stockholder or holder of Company Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, or any other interest in the Company.

The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”. References to articles, sections, clauses, paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections, clauses and paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.4 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon contained in Sections 8.3(c), 8.3(d) and 8.3(e) be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a party’s liability or obligations hereunder or under the Equity Commitment Letters or the Guarantees.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any Action before any Governmental Authority of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the United States Federal and New York State courts located in New York County, State of New York and (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including as it relates to (A) the interpretation of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect (and whether or not a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred), (B) the determination of the accuracy of any Specified Acquisition Agreement Representation (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent has the right to terminate its obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (i) or decline to consummate the Closing as a result thereof without resulting in the payment of any fees, liquidated damages or other amounts under the Acquisition Agreement   69








________________


pursuant to Section 7.2(a) and (C) the determination of whether the Closing has been consummated in accordance with the terms hereof, which will in each case be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of Laws thereof), all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. 


Section 9.9 Specific Performance. (a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, subject to Section 9.9(b), the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the right of a party hereto to cause the other parties hereto to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Subject to Section 9.9(b), each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or any other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to show proof of actual damages or provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Order. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Section 9.9(a) is not intended to, and shall not be construed to, limit in any way, and shall be subject in all respects to, the provisions of Section 8.3(c), Section 8.3(d) and Section 9.9(b). (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and without limiting any right of the Company to enforce any other obligations of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth herein, it is explicitly agreed that prior to a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall be entitled to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to cause Parent and Acquisition Sub to cause, or for the Company directly to cause, in accordance with its third party beneficiary rights under the Equity Commitment Letters, the Equity Financing to be funded on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters and this Agreement and cause the Closing to occur if, and only if, each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) Parent fails to consummate the Closing on the date on   70

which the Closing Date is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.2, (iii) the financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if Alternative Financing is being used in accordance with Section 6.11(c), pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded in accordance with its terms or will be funded at the Closing in accordance with its terms if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (iv) the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or, if Alternative Financing is being used in accordance with Section 6.11(c), pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) are funded, then the Closing will occur and (v) Parent does not consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days after delivery of the written notice specified in clause (iv) above (it being understood that the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied) shall remain satisfied at the close of business on such third (3rd) Business Day). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may pursue a grant of specific performance of the type provided in the preceding sentence and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under Section 8.3(b), but in no event be entitled to obtain both (x) a grant of specific performance pursuant to this Section 9.9(b) and (y) payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or any monetary damages, and the Company’s termination of this Agreement triggering the Company’s right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or its acceptance of all of the Reverse Termination Fee shall terminate any right of the Company to injunctive relief or specific performance hereunder to cause the Closing to occur. 


Section 9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state courts of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, (d) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and (e) agrees that each of the other parties hereto shall have the right to bring any Action for enforcement of a judgment entered by the state courts of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

________________


SECTION 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the parties hereto shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the “Effective Time”). 


SECTION 1.4 Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company. 


SECTION 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, and as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

ARTICLE II EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 


SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or Merger Sub Common Stock: (a) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in Merger Sub (the “Merger Sub Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates, if any, representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock and non-certificated shares of Merger Sub Common Stock held in book entry shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. (b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2: (i) Each share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall be automatically, and without any election on the part of the holder of Company Class A Common Stock, converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Class A Common Stock such that each holder of record of shares of Company Class A Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have the right to receive, in the aggregate, a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Class A Exchange Ratio, with such product rounded up to the next whole share of Parent Class A Common Stock (the “Class A Merger Consideration”), and each such share of Company Class A Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each (A) valid certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Class A Common Stock (each, a “Class A Certificate”) or (B) non-certificated share of Company Class A Common Stock held in book entry (each, a “Class A Book-Entry Share”) shall, upon the Effective Time, represent the right to receive the Class A Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of such Class A Certificate or such Class A Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest. (ii) Each share of Company Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall be automatically, and without any election on the part of the holder of Company Class B Common Stock, converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Class B Common Stock such that each holder of record of shares of Company Class B Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have the right to receive, in the aggregate, a number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Class B Common Stock held of record by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Class B Exchange Ratio, with such product rounded up to the next whole share of Parent Common Stock (the “Class B Merger Consideration”), and each such share of Company Class B Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and each (A) valid certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Class B Common Stock (each, a “Class B Certificate”) or (B) non-certificated share of Company Class B Common Stock held in book entry (each, a “Class B Book-Entry Share”) shall, upon the Effective Time, represent the right to receive the Class B Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of such Class B Certificate or Class B Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.   4








________________


(iii) Each Excluded Share shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; provided, that any Excluded Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or the Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 


SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and Parent Class B Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration. All such Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund.” (b) Letter of Transmittal. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than holders of only Excluded Shares) (i) a form of letter of transmittal (the “Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any shares evidenced by Certificates or any Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon (A) with respect to shares evidenced by Certificates, delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and (B) with respect to Book-Entry Shares, upon proper delivery of any “agent’s message” regarding the book-entry transfer of such Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), as applicable, to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, which shall be in a form finalized prior to the Effective Time and have such other provisions as Parent may specify subject to the Company’s reasonable approval. (c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon (i) the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, or (ii) the receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent, in the case of Book-Entry Shares and, in each case, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been   5

converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and (B) any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(d) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock (or, if the relevant share of Company Common Stock is a Book-Entry Share, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent and Parent that any applicable stock transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(c), each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares), and any Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock were entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) (and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable, if applicable, upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. (d) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share, until the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender or transfer of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, such holder shall be paid, without interest (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable as of the date of such surrender or transfer with respect to the Parent Common Stock into which the shares represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Shares have been converted as of the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to the Parent Common Stock into which the shares represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Shares have been converted as of the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement. (e) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled in respect of the issued shares of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock or Book- Entry Shares (other than Excluded Shares) are presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.   6








________________


(f) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates or scrip representing them) shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(b). For the avoidance of doubt, no Person that is not a record holder of Company Class A Common Stock or Company Class B Common Stock will be entitled hereunder to have any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock rounded up (and such rounding shall only apply with respect to shares of Company Class A Common Stock and/or Company Class B Common Stock held of record by any such record holder), and none of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub shall have any obligation pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i) or Section 2.1(b)(ii) with respect to any Person that is not a record holder of Company Class A Common Stock or Company Class B Common Stock, respectively (or with respect to any shares of Company Class A Common Stock or Company Class B Common Stock, respectively, held in any manner other than as shares held of record by such record holder). (g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II, in each case without any interest thereon. (h) No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to such date on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (i) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. (j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   7

SECTION 2.3 Treatment of Company Equity Awards. (a) Company Stock Options. Each Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a Parent Stock Option to purchase (i) that number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Class A Exchange Ratio, (ii) at a per-share exercise price (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Class A Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Class A Exchange Ratio; provided that for each Company Stock Option subject to performance vesting conditions that is outstanding on the date of this Agreement and that remains outstanding at the Effective Time, (x) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock used in clause (i)(A) of this sentence shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock that would be subject to such Company Stock Option assuming the performance conditions applicable thereto were achieved at 100% of target and (y) each such Company Stock Option shall convert to a Parent Stock Option with time-based vesting conditions for the remainder of the applicable performance period. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.3(a), each such Parent Stock Option shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. (b) Company RSU Awards. Each Company RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a Parent RSU Award with respect to a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Class A Exchange Ratio; provided that for each Company RSU Award subject to performance vesting conditions that is outstanding on the date of this Agreement and that remains outstanding at the Effective Time, (x) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock used in clause (i) of this sentence shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock that would be subject to such Company RSU Award assuming the performance conditions applicable thereto were achieved at 100% of target and (y) each such Company RSU Award shall convert to a Parent RSU Award with time- based vesting conditions for the remainder of the applicable performance period. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.3(b), each such Parent RSU Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.   8

(c) Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all Company Equity Awards shall be treated in a manner so as not to result in the incurrence of a penalty tax under Section 409A of the Code.

Each of the parties shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any substantive communication, inquiry or investigation received by that party from, or given by it to, any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication to any such Governmental Authority and incorporate the other party’s reasonable comments to any such communication to a Governmental Authority; (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Transactions unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate therein; and (iv) promptly furnish the other party with drafts of all substantive correspondence, filings and written communications between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and any such Governmental Authority or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, in order for such other party to meaningfully consult and participate in such correspondence, filing or written communication; provided that the materials furnished pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) may be redacted as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege, to remove references concerning valuation, as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or as otherwise required by applicable Law.

SECTION 6.4 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each former and present (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and each person who served as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, a “D&O Indemnified Party”), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any Action with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement, the Transactions and other actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the D&O Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint   50

venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise or other Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement, a true and complete copy of which agreement has been made available (including by filing with the SEC) by the Company prior to the date hereof, to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain in effect (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law) the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company’s and any Company Subsidiary’s articles of incorporation and by-laws or other organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any agreement, in each case in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. (b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the Effective Time by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on terms and conditions not less favorable to the insured Persons than, and from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as, the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall Parent be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 350% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance (the “Maximum Amount”); provided, however, that if such insurance can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Amount, Parent shall obtain the most advantageous policy of directors’ and officers’ insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may in its discretion purchase, and Parent may in its discretion purchase if the Company declines to do so, a “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy covering the six (6)-year period from and after the Effective Time from a carrier with comparable or better credit ratings to the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy carrier and on terms and conditions not less favorable to the insured Persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided that without Parent’s consent, the cost of such “tail” policy shall not exceed the Maximum Amount (it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that this sentence shall not release any obligation of Parent set forth in the preceding sentence unless and until a “tail” policy is actually obtained). (c) Except as set forth in Section 6.4(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, in the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Company shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.   51

(d) At and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of the foregoing; provided, however, that the D&O Indemnified Party to whom funds are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification under Law applicable to Parent) each D&O Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law against any costs or expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Action, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the D&O Indemnified Party is or was an officer, employee or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise or other Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Company shall reasonably cooperate with the D&O Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action. (e) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each D&O Indemnified Party. 


SECTION 6.5 Employment Matters. (a) Each Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue in employment with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) immediately following the Effective Time (such employees, the “Continuing Employees”). Following the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) shall honor and perform in accordance with their terms all Company Plans, including all employment, severance, bonus, transaction, incentive and other compensation arrangements. (b) Except as set forth in Section 6.5(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, for a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to each Continuing Employee, (i) base salary or regular hourly wage, as applicable, that is not less than the base salary or regular hourly wage, as applicable, provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) cash bonus, commission or annual incentive opportunities that are no less favorable than the cash bonus, commission or annual incentive opportunities (which, with respect to equity-based compensation, shall be determined based on target grant date fair market value) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) employee and fringe benefits (including, vacation/leave, health, welfare, retirement and severance benefits) that are at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as (A) those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (B) those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. (c) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall recognize, or shall (if and to the same extent recognized under an analogous Parent Plan prior to Closing) cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to recognize, each Continuing Employee’s employment or service with the Company (including any current or former Affiliate thereof or any   52

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods, actively at work requirements, evidence of insurability requirements or required physical examinations under any health or similar plan of the Company, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate) to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, except to the extent that any waiting period, exclusions or requirements still applied to such Continuing Employee under the comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Closing, and (ii) fully credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of the Company prior to the Closing during the plan year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which such Continuing Employee has satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan year under any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan of the Company, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate) as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan. (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 6.5 are included for the sole benefit of Parent and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Parent Plan or Company Plan, (ii) shall limit the right of Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Parent Plan or Company Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement following the Closing Date, or (iii) shall confer upon any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (including any equityholder, any current or former director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company, or any participant in any Company Plan or Parent Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)), any right to continued or resumed employment or recall, any right to compensation or benefits, or any third-party beneficiary or other right of any kind or nature whatsoever.

(b) Representation Letters. Each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to deliver to each of Parent Tax Counsel and Company Tax Counsel representation letters dated as of the Closing Date (and if requested, dated as of the date determined necessary by counsel in connection with any SEC filings) substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the “Parent Tax Representation Letter”) or, in the case of the Company, Exhibit E (the “Company Tax Representation Letter,” and together with the Parent Tax Representation Letter, the “Tax Representation Letters”) and signed by an officer or director of Parent or the Company, as applicable. (c) Opinion from Alternative Tax Counsel. In connection with the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(e), Parent agrees that if Parent receives a Parent Change in Law Opinion from Parent Tax Counsel, it shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a Merger Tax Opinion from alternative tax counsel of similar standing. In connection with the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.3(e), the Company agrees that if the Company receives a Company Change in Law Opinion from Company Tax Counsel, it shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a Merger Tax Opinion from alternative tax counsel of similar standing. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with alternative tax counsel, including by providing the necessary representation letters and other materials reasonably requested by alternative tax counsel to either party. In the event that alternative tax counsel is unwilling or unable to deliver the required opinion with the requisite level of certainty, and that Parent or the Company, as applicable, has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such opinion from alternative tax counsel, then Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall not be required to select any other alternative tax counsel. (d) Parent and the Company agree that if either party cannot deliver a Tax Representation Letter at the Closing, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to modifications to the Tax Representation Letter or to the structure of the acquisition contemplated by this Agreement (which change in structure would not be reasonably be expected to result in any material cost to Parent or the Company) that would nonetheless permit Parent Tax Counsel and Company Tax Counsel to provide Merger Tax Opinions at the Closing. 


SECTION 6.7 Transaction Litigation. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation against the Company or its directors or officers by a holder of securities of the Company relating to the Transactions and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting in any way the parties’ obligations under Section 6.3, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to cooperate, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal counsel, financial advisors, independent auditors, and other advisors and representatives to cooperate, in the defense against any litigation by a holder of securities of the Company or of Parent, as applicable.   54

SECTION 6.9 Public Announcements. Except with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with Section 5.3 or 5.4, Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and to consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions, and not to issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences of this Section 6.9, Parent and the Company may make any oral or written public announcements, releases or statements without complying with the foregoing requirements if the substance of such announcements, releases or statements, was publicly disclosed and previously subject to the foregoing requirements. 


SECTION 6.10 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

The table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof”, “hereto”, “hereby”, “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term “or” is not exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms.

(including Merger Sub) to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. A document, agreement or other information shall be deemed to be “made available” to a party, without limitation, if such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party thereto or if such party or any of its Subsidiaries has access to such document, agreement or other information in the ordinary course of business or if a copy thereof has been provided to such party or its Subsidiaries or Representatives prior to the date hereof. 


SECTION 9.6 Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the information and disclosures contained in any Section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule as though fully set forth in such other Section to the extent the applicability and relevance of such information to such other Section is reasonably apparent on the face of such information and (b) the information and disclosures contained in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule as though fully set forth in such other Section to the extent the applicability and relevance of such information to such other Section is reasonably apparent on the face of such information. Certain items and matters are listed in the Disclosure Schedules for informational purposes only and may not be required to be listed therein by the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the listing of items or matters in a Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations and warranties or the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. No reference to, or disclosure of, any item or matter in any Section of this Agreement or any Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or indication that such item or matter is material or required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no disclosure of any item in a Disclosure Schedule, including any reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or Order, shall be construed as an admission, indication or acknowledgement of any liability or obligation with respect to any third party or that a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. 


SECTION 9.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this Section 9.7 with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are consummated to the extent possible.

No extension or waiver by Parent shall require the approval of the stockholders of Parent unless such approval is required by Law and no extension or waiver by the Company shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company unless such approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.   76

SECTION 9.14 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue. (a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that any Action with respect to this Agreement, arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the rights and obligations hereunder shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction over such Action, any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware.

SECTION 9.15 Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, except where this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the parties hereto shall be entitled (on behalf of themselves and the third-party beneficiaries of the merger agreement) to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereto further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.   77

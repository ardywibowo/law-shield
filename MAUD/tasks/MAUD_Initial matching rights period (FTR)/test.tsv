Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or cause the Company to enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Company Superior Proposal unless the Company  has  first  complied  with  the  provisions  of Section 5.2(f)  and,  after  so  complying,  the  Company  Board  determines  in  good  faith  that  such  Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal.

For the avoidance of doubt, delivery and receipt of a Notice of Company Superior Proposal shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.  <omitted>  Section 7.1        Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, as follows (with any termination by Parent also being an effective termination by Merger Sub): <omitted> (d) by the Company: <omitted>  (ii)             prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in order to enter into a definitive agreement to effect a Company Superior Proposal, if the Company has complied with Section 5.2 (including Section 5.2(f)) in all material respects and enters into such definitive agreement concurrently with such termination and pays the Termination Fee in accordance with the procedures and within the time periods set forth in Section 7.3(a).

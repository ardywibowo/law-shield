(Page 36)
B	Section 7.3 No Solicitation by the Company. <omitted> (b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(a) or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives an unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal not resulting, in whole or in part, from a breach of this Section 7.3, that the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (i) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal and (ii) failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may, in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, furnish nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group (or any of their Representatives or potential financing sources) making such Company Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group and their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal (Page 68)
B	Section 6.02          No Solicitation by the Company. <omitted> (b)          The foregoing notwithstanding, if at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Approval Time”), the Board of Directors of the Company receives a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not resulted from a violation of this Section 6.02, the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) contact the Third Party that has made such Company Acquisition Proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors of the Company informing itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (A) subject to compliance with this Section 6.02, engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that (1) does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02 and (2) contains confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.

A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act in connection with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. (Page 75)

Prior to or concurrently with providing any non-public information to such third party, the Company shall make such non-public information available to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously made available by the Company to Parent). The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) inform Parent if the Company furnishes non-public information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided for in this Section 4.2(a) and will keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day), of the status and terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes to the terms thereof) and the status of any discussions and negotiations with respect thereto.

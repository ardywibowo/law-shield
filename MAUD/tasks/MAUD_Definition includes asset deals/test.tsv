Any material changes with respect to the Intervening Event mentioned above, or material changes to the financial terms of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior to the Company’s effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and a new three (3) Business Day period.
